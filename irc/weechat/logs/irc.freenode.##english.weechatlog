2020-09-15 13:19:25	drbean	The Japanese nuisance passive also can be used with transitive verbs.

2020-09-15 13:21:01	drbean	It sounds like the 3-year-old Arthur had the king of the neighboring country kill his parents.

2020-09-15 13:30:51	hoglahoo	It seems less okay to me because having your father killed generally means you arranged for him to be killed
2020-09-15 13:31:06	LuisM18	don't think so ... unless literally on him .. oh dear, don't wanna be a killing board

2020-09-10 22:58:33	tinwhiskers	the only one I've seen so far that is really wrong is "The harbor was left by the ship"
2020-09-10 22:58:38	wkalt	I think all the cases you noted above are correct, but I would say the first variants are the preferred style.
2020-09-10 22:59:08	wkalt	yeah tinwhiskers that one is the oddest seeming one but I see no reason it's not correct. Usual advice is "don't use the passive voice".
2020-09-10 22:59:23	tinwhiskers	and when I say wrong, I mean it's grammatically ok, but totally unnatural.
2020-09-10 22:59:28	wkalt	right
2020-09-10 22:59:49	drbean	'She was abandoned by her husband,' but not, 'He was abandoned by his wife'?

2020-09-10 23:00:06	wkalt	her husband abandoned her <- that's the active voice

2020-09-10 23:02:11	drbean	'The garbage was left by a man in a black hat' is OK, but 'The harbor was left by a ship with a black flag' is not OK.
2020-09-10 23:02:34	wkalt	Neither of those are OK stylistically. Both of them are OK gramatically.
2020-09-10 23:02:39	tinwhiskers	actually that makes it ok
2020-09-10 23:03:06	 *	LuisM14 thinks it ok
2020-09-10 23:03:18	tinwhiskers	"The harbor was left by the ship" is just very weird but "The harbor was left by a ship with a black flag" is fine.
2020-09-10 23:04:49	wkalt	I wouldn't say they are weird, but both can be improved with the active voice. "The ship left the harbor", "The black-flagged ship left the harbor" are both more natural IMO.

2020-09-10 23:54:07	Kaylah	oh, sorry if it's a bit offtopic
2020-09-10 23:54:32	drbean	Use google translate?
2020-09-10 23:54:54	Kaylah	it translates it too literaly
2020-09-10 23:54:59	Kaylah	literally*
2020-09-10 23:55:05	drbean	But it translates 'cheap' into Chinese as the equivalent of 'stingy'.
2020-09-10 23:55:14	Kaylah	lol
2020-09-10 23:55:25	Kaylah	it's a very technical term
2020-09-10 23:56:11	drbean	Translate it in a longer context. It may have a better translation like it does for 'not cheap, expensive'
2020-09-10 23:56:28	Kaylah	i'll try that, thanks

2020-09-10 23:58:49	drbean	What is the Dutch strategy for transfering technical terms into English?
2020-09-10 23:59:28	tinwhiskers	so I guess it means "net" as in "complete"... "complete section failure" might translate better.
2020-09-10 23:59:32	Kaylah	going to the wiki page in English, and then clicking 'Dutch' in the language column on the right, and seeing what the new title is :p
2020-09-10 23:59:45	drbean	Use google translate to translate other terms which give good translations and then adopt the same strategy to translate 'net section failure'
2020-09-11 00:00:13	Kaylah	I'm not sure if that's what it means in this context tinsoldier, could also be in contrast to "gross section", but I'm not sure what extra part of the section that would include
2020-09-11 00:00:48	tinwhiskers	well, it is also describing a complete (bilateral) failure.

2020-09-11 00:06:23	tinwhiskers	well, it's not going to mean net as in fishing net, it's going to mean net as in complete.

2020-09-11 00:06:39	drbean	If 'net section failure' is not a term of art in English, then it's unlikely there is a term of art in Dutch to which 'net section failure' is the English equivalent.
2020-09-11 00:07:06	papna	nalkri: No, it's (net section) fracture

2020-09-11 00:26:09	drbean	'net section' 'gross section' must have equivalents in Dutch.
2020-09-11 00:26:43	drbean	I assume 'net section' is the weaker direction, 'gross' is the stronger.
2020-09-11 00:27:17	Kaylah	hmm well I know that for bolts there is a difference between different cross sections
2020-09-11 00:27:48	Kaylah	a bolt is like a cylinder, but if the bolt is threaded, then the edges are not smooth
2020-09-11 00:28:12	Kaylah	and the net section is then the area of the section that makes up a circle, and everything outside of that circle doesn't count
2020-09-11 00:28:15	drbean	'netto sectie' says google.
2020-09-11 00:28:17	Kaylah	whereas the gross section is the entire section

2020-09-21 15:11:12	stinkpot	the problem is that 'misbehaved' is a participle that isn't really used as an adjective
2020-09-21 15:11:24	drbean	misbehaving _NOUN_' is more common than 'misbehaved _NOUN_', but 'badly behaved _NOUN_' is more common than 'badly behaving _NOUN_' at https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=badly+behaved+_NOUN_%2C+badly+behaving+_NOUN_%2Cmisbehaved+_NOUN_%2Cmisbehaving+_NOUN_

2020-10-26 10:13:18	drbean	I've been thinking about ergative verbs, like 'sail', 'sink', '
2020-10-26 10:13:18	drbean	'open', 'close' which can be used as intransitive, and transitive verbs.
2020-10-26 10:14:05	drbean	If you open/close the door, the door opens/closes.
2020-10-26 10:15:06	drbean	And if you sail the boat out the harbor or sink it to the bottom, it sails out of the harbor and sinks to the bottom.
2020-10-26 10:15:37	drbean	But what about 'sit up'?
2020-10-26 10:16:05	drbean	You can sit someone up and they can sit up, but what about a baby?
2020-10-26 10:16:34	drbean	The mother sits the baby up, and the baby sits up? I don't think so.
2020-10-26 10:17:04	drbean	Babies can't sit up. Or raise themselves into a sitting position.
2020-10-26 10:17:48	drbean	And what about the doors which open when you approach?
2020-10-26 10:18:05	drbean	Do you open the door, when the door opens? I don't think so.
2020-10-26 10:18:22	audrey	English, unlike many Indo-European languages, does not overtly mark whether a verb is transitive or intransitive.
2020-10-26 10:18:36	drbean	The door opens by itself.
2020-10-26 10:18:50	drbean	Can I quote you in a blog post?
2020-10-26 10:18:57	audrey	This has been the source of great irritation for me, because of all the ambiguity it introduces.

2020-10-26 10:21:51	drbean	You're not just approaching it. You're putting your hand on it.
2020-10-26 10:22:28	audrey	twb: I don´t know about Urdu, but in the IE languages I´ve studied (RU/UK/ES/IT/FR/EO), transitivity is often indicated via a reflexive, or in some cases there are separate roots entirely for the transitive/intransitive pair.
2020-10-26 10:23:00	twb	are RU and UK PIE languages?
2020-10-26 10:24:06	audrey	For example, in Russian, «to boil» is expressed via two different etymologically related, but morphemically distinct verbs: кипеть (ntr.) and кипятить (tr.).
2020-10-26 10:24:17	audrey	Yes, Russian and Ukrainian are Indo-European languages, in the Slavic family.
2020-10-26 10:25:55	drbean	That's like Japanese, where many (most?) verbs have distinct forms for in/transitive verbs.
2020-10-26 10:26:40	audrey	In Esperanto (which is IE in practice, even if not technically), verbal roots are inherently transitive or intransitive, and to change the transitivity value, one appends the suffix -ig- (for transitivity) or -iĝ- (for intransitivity).
2020-10-26 10:26:41	drbean	"The door opened and the president came in" and "The president opened the door and came in"
2020-10-26 10:27:47	drbean	the word corresponding to 'open' isn't the same in the 2 sentences in Japanese.
2020-10-26 10:28:50	drbean	'two different etymologically related, but morphemically distinct verbs'
2020-10-26 10:29:20	audrey	In Romance languages, intransitivity is often expressed via a reflexive pronoun, e.g. Se abren los cielos - the skies open, but literally, «the skies open themselves».
2020-10-26 10:29:22	drbean	"The ghost went out and the door closed" and "The ghost went out and closed the door"
2020-10-26 10:30:10	audrey	English is a bit of an oddity in this respect.
2020-10-26 10:30:19	drbean	Again, 'two different etymologically related, but morphemically distinct verbs'
2020-10-26 10:31:12	audrey	This makes verbs marginally easier to learn over e.g. Esperanto verbal roots, but at a cost to clarity and disambiguation.

2020-10-26 10:42:13	audrey	Fun, completely irrelevant factoid: in Esperanto «fermi», meaning «to close», is transitive, but the antonym «aperti» is intransitive - «to be open».
2020-10-26 10:42:46	audrey	Lest anyone think Esperanto is, y´know, actually simple. Human language and reasoning are far too complex to be reduced to a narrow set of syntactical rules.
2020-10-26 10:43:10	drbean	And English appears to have only 2 intransitive/transitive verbs like the Russian verb for 'boil' that audrey mentioned, and the many Japanese verbs that are similar but different in intransitive/transitive use.
2020-10-26 10:43:45	audrey	(The reason is that fermi is a verbal root, but aperti is actually an adjectival root...)
