2013-12-30 17:04:22	twb	^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2013-12-30 17:04:24	JZA	detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2013-12-30 17:04:34	JZA	oh, that didnt work
2013-12-30 17:04:41	twb	If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2013-12-30 17:04:53	JZA	I am using konsole
2013-12-30 17:04:55	twb	If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2013-12-30 17:05:04	JZA	ok
2013-12-30 17:05:16	twb	You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2013-12-30 17:05:27	twb	What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"

2013-12-30 17:10:00	JZA	i would have an 'exit screen'

2014-01-02 14:04:53	JZA	:)
2014-01-02 14:16:37	twb	Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-02 14:16:56	twb	Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-02 14:19:21	JZA	nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-02 14:19:47	twb	I am not familiar with that notation.

2014-01-05 03:11:06	hamush	hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-05 03:11:47	hamush	the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-05 03:12:04	hamush	ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-05 03:12:21	hamush	does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-05 03:14:16	hamush	ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want

2014-01-05 03:25:26	hamush	it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-05 03:26:02	hamush	any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-05 03:31:29	hamush	i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work

2014-01-07 12:01:36	robonerd	heya
2014-01-07 12:02:42	robonerd	if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-07 12:08:39	twb	I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-07 12:08:43	twb	Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-07 12:10:44	robonerd	how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-07 12:10:49	robonerd	i generally just set up servers
2014-01-07 12:11:01	twb	I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-07 12:11:08	twb	editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-07 12:11:43	robonerd	well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-07 12:11:47	robonerd	how do i set that?
2014-01-07 12:16:21	twb	I said it might.
2014-01-07 12:16:26	twb	You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-07 12:16:37	twb	It should be easy to test

2014-01-10 04:17:28	oskie	hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-10 04:31:18	oskie	yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically

2014-01-14 19:55:47	fluxdude	I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-14 19:55:56	fluxdude	here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-14 19:55:57	fluxdude	caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-14 19:55:58	rudi_s	dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-14 19:56:17	fluxdude	any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-14 19:57:19	fluxdude	only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-14 19:57:55	dbolser	rudi_s: OK,  many thanks

2014-01-14 19:57:57	fluxdude	programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating

2014-01-14 19:58:34	rudi_s	fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-14 19:58:52	rudi_s	(Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-14 19:58:53	lewellyn	fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-14 19:58:59	lewellyn	i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested

2014-01-15 06:16:08	g0tcha	hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-15 06:16:50	twb	unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-15 06:17:41	g0tcha	i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-15 06:18:19	twb	Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-15 06:18:39	twb	'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-15 06:19:01	Gedge	-X sessionname
2014-01-15 06:19:05	twb	screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-15 06:19:36	g0tcha	ah ok
2014-01-15 06:19:37	Gedge	screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-15 06:19:39	g0tcha	makes sense now
2014-01-15 06:19:52	g0tcha	but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-15 06:20:00	Gedge	-S oldname
2014-01-15 06:20:34	Gedge	a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-15 06:21:53	g0tcha	i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-15 06:22:01	g0tcha	for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-15 06:22:10	g0tcha	1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-15 06:22:29	g0tcha	so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-15 06:23:07	twb	Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-15 06:23:22	Gedge	I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-15 06:24:30	g0tcha	i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-15 06:25:00	twb	now you do.
2014-01-15 06:25:55	g0tcha	live and learn

2014-01-17 04:41:56	vaskozl_	brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-17 04:42:09	vaskozl_	i did to no avail :/
2014-01-17 04:44:29	ski	what did you try ?
2014-01-17 04:48:33	vaskozl_	I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-17 04:48:47	vaskozl_	so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-17 04:49:19	vaskozl_	it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-17 04:49:28	vaskozl_	ledoff that is
2014-01-17 04:50:25	ski	oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-17 04:50:46	ski	it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-17 04:51:01	ski	`eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-17 04:51:02	vaskozl_	what do you mean?
2014-01-17 04:51:12	vaskozl_	aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-17 04:51:33	ski	`bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-17 04:51:36	ski	vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-17 04:51:54	vaskozl_	yes I know
2014-01-17 04:52:17	ski	your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-17 04:52:33	vaskozl_	n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-17 04:52:38	ski	(perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-17 04:52:50	vaskozl_	I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-17 04:52:53	vaskozl_	bit it isn't
2014-01-17 04:53:08	vaskozl_	the ledoff one
2014-01-17 04:53:22	vaskozl_	eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-17 04:54:28	vaskozl_	wait it just worked
2014-01-17 04:54:29	vaskozl_	hah
2014-01-17 04:54:32	vaskozl_	magic
2014-01-17 04:55:17	vaskozl_	ls
2014-01-17 04:55:40	vaskozl_	I found out where the problem was

2014-01-17 04:57:45	vaskozl_	how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?

2014-01-17 05:00:15	vaskozl_	gracias
2014-01-17 05:00:29	brainwash	might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-17 05:01:17	brainwash	and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-17 05:03:39	vaskozl_	brainwash: which version is this?
2014-01-17 05:04:37	brainwash	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog

2014-01-17 10:23:20	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD

2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-17 10:23:20	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-17 10:23:20	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-17 10:23:20	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-17 10:23:20	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday

2014-01-17 10:23:20	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory

2014-01-17 10:23:20	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:20	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-17 10:23:20	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?

2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-17 10:23:20	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-17 10:23:20	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt

2014-01-17 10:23:20	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-17 10:23:20	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526

2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-17 10:23:20	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty

2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"

2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-17 10:23:20	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes

2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-17 10:23:20	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-17 10:23:20	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-17 10:23:20	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-17 10:23:20	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-17 10:23:20	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-17 10:23:20	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-17 10:23:20	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-17 10:23:20	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-17 10:23:20	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn

2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:55:17] ls
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[05:00:15] gracias
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:04:37] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:04:44] Version 4.1.0
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:05:10] aren't you running arch?
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-17 10:23:20	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-17 10:23:20	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-17 10:23:20	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one

2014-01-22 21:50:32	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-22 21:50:32	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-22 21:50:32	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-22 21:50:32	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-22 21:50:32	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-22 21:50:32	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-22 21:50:32	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:32	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-22 21:50:32	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-22 21:50:32	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-01-22 21:50:32	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-22 21:50:32	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-22 21:50:32	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc

2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-01-22 21:50:32	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-22 21:50:32	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-22 21:50:32	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-22 21:50:32	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-22 21:50:32	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[17:09:07] Grr.

2014-01-22 21:50:32	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command

2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic

2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?

2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think

2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:04:44] Version 4.1.0
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:05:10] aren't you running arch?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-22 21:50:32	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-22 21:50:32	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-01-22 21:50:32	Disconsented	[17:43:59] Question about screen: Everytime I detach a session (C + A D) it seems to stay there but is inactive, am I doing somthing wrong? http://i.imgur.com/R1YFVXm.png
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]
2014-01-22 21:50:32	somian[wc]	[01:19:12] Goodbye, later, folks.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[11:54:38] hello
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[14:34:45] (aka 'meta')
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-22 21:50:32	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-22 21:50:32	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-22 21:50:32	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-22 21:50:32	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-22 21:50:32	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-22 21:50:32	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-22 21:50:32	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?

2014-01-26 10:12:48	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-26 10:12:48	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-26 10:12:48	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-26 10:12:48	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-26 10:12:48	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-26 10:12:48	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-26 10:12:48	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:48	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-26 10:12:48	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-26 10:12:48	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt

2014-01-26 10:12:48	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-26 10:12:48	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526

2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-26 10:12:48	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-26 10:12:48	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-26 10:12:48	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!

2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty

2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"

2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes

2014-01-26 10:12:48	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space

2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-26 10:12:48	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-26 10:12:48	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-26 10:12:48	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-26 10:12:48	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn

2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:55:17] ls
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[05:00:15] gracias
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:04:37] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:04:44] Version 4.1.0
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:05:10] aren't you running arch?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-26 10:12:48	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-26 10:12:48	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-01-26 10:12:48	Disconsented	[17:43:59] Question about screen: Everytime I detach a session (C + A D) it seems to stay there but is inactive, am I doing somthing wrong? http://i.imgur.com/R1YFVXm.png
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]
2014-01-26 10:12:48	somian[wc]	[01:19:12] Goodbye, later, folks.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[11:54:38] hello
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[14:34:45] (aka 'meta')
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-26 10:12:48	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-26 10:12:48	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-26 10:12:48	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-26 10:12:48	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-26 10:12:48	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-26 10:12:48	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-26 10:12:48	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-26 10:12:48	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-26 10:12:48	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood

2014-01-27 20:14:00	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-27 20:14:00	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-27 20:14:00	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-27 20:14:00	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-27 20:14:00	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-27 20:14:00	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-27 20:14:00	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-27 20:14:00	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY

2014-01-27 20:14:00	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-27 20:14:00	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-27 20:14:00	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt

2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?

2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-27 20:14:00	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)

2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed

2014-01-27 20:14:00	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space

2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-27 20:14:00	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-27 20:14:00	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-27 20:14:00	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn

2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:55:17] ls
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[05:00:15] gracias
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:04:37] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:04:44] Version 4.1.0
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:05:10] aren't you running arch?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-27 20:14:00	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-27 20:14:00	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]
2014-01-27 20:14:00	somian[wc]	[01:19:12] Goodbye, later, folks.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[11:54:38] hello
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[14:34:45] (aka 'meta')
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-27 20:14:00	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-27 20:14:00	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-27 20:14:00	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-27 20:14:00	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-27 20:14:00	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-27 20:14:00	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-01-27 20:14:00	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-01-27 20:14:00	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-01-27 20:14:00	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-01-27 20:14:00	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.

2014-01-28 09:22:46	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 09:22:46	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-28 09:22:46	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-28 09:22:46	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-28 09:22:46	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-28 09:22:46	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-28 09:22:46	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:46	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-28 09:22:46	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-28 09:22:46	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526

2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-28 09:22:46	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[21:16:59] hi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc

2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-01-28 09:22:46	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[18:31:11] hihi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-28 09:22:46	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:09:07] Grr.

2014-01-28 09:22:46	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command

2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah

2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[05:00:15] gracias
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:04:37] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:04:44] Version 4.1.0
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:05:10] aren't you running arch?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-28 09:22:46	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-28 09:22:46	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-01-28 09:22:46	Disconsented	[17:43:59] Question about screen: Everytime I detach a session (C + A D) it seems to stay there but is inactive, am I doing somthing wrong? http://i.imgur.com/R1YFVXm.png
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]
2014-01-28 09:22:46	somian[wc]	[01:19:12] Goodbye, later, folks.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[11:54:38] hello
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[14:34:45] (aka 'meta')
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-28 09:22:46	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-28 09:22:46	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-28 09:22:46	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-28 09:22:46	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-28 09:22:46	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-28 09:22:46	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-01-28 09:22:46	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-01-28 09:22:46	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[22:41:03] hello all !
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[22:41:22] someone know that is the C-a O shortcut ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	RadoQ	[22:52:26] fe0dor, "man screenrc" can tell you.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	RadoQ	[22:52:35] oops, "man screen". ;)
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:07:52] RadoQ: no
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:08:05] there is nothing about this shortcut in my screen man
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:08:58] there is nothing about C-a O & C-a I
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:09:01] C-a ? lists the current shortcuts.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:09:29] there is nothing about C-a+O & C-a+I Soliton 
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:09:36] and not C-a :p
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:09:37] neither of those is a default sbinding.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:09:58] on my, it's default binding
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:10:12] C-a ? does not list C-a it is implicit to all bindings listed there.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:10:37] unless you mean C-a C-a which it does list.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:10:45] do you read what i write ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:10:59] i've said : C-a + O
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:11:06] do you see this O ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:11:11] yes.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:11:16] :p
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:11:24] there is no such default binding.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:11:34] maybe you meant C-a 0?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:11:35] but on my, there is this default binding
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:11:38] no no
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:12:02] you having some specific binding is pretty much the opposite of default.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:12:05] if i say to you the text on the bottom, can you tell me what it does ?
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:12:16] that's why i mentioned C-a ? which lists your bindings.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:12:23] oh sorry
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:13:13] i may have an idea if you paste the output of the command, sure.
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:13:18] nothing
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:13:27] i check the output
2014-01-28 09:22:46	Soliton	[23:13:50] you said something about "text on the bottom".
2014-01-28 09:22:46	fe0dor	[23:14:06] for C-a O that said : This window is already logged out
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:14:15] for the C-a ? : nothing about it
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:14:52] for C-a I that said : This window is now logged in
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:15:35] for C-a O that said : This window is no longer logged in
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:15:36] so C-a ? shows you a line with "O login on" and "I login off" presumably.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:15:49] no : nothing in C-a ?
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:16:01] i check again
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:16:24] nothing at all
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:16:30] seems like a common addition in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:16:57] and what that want mean ? :d
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:17:56] you're now allowed to consult the man page and ask more specific questions if it's still unclear.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:18:53] but i've tell you there it nothing about this shortcut in the man page
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:19:13] that is a joke ?
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:19:52] actually that very binding is mentioned verbatim as an example in my man page.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	RadoQ	[23:19:53] fe0dor, "man" just has default, if you don't find it there, it's not default. Then meta-'?' will help with you _current_ custom binding.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:20:12] either way you also know the command it invokes now.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:20:13] i've change nothing in this tool
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:20:16] NOTHING
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:20:31] it's not difficult to understand this
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:20:47] that's only the debian package
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:20:52] very likely it's in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:21:54] anyway, since you now know it's invoking the login command you can look that up in the man page.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:22:11] i've did it before asking you
2014-01-28 09:22:47	fe0dor	[23:22:22] and that's not like the -L option
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:22:29] certainly.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[23:28:51] i wonder if he has a very small terminal so he actually had to press space to see the custom bindings.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	caveat-	[05:25:37] Soliton: I've tried screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi, it works well if there isn't already a window 0, but if a window 0 already exists, it runs screen in a new window, leaving the window 0 too
2014-01-28 09:22:47	caveat-	[05:28:40] the irssi process is killed by the kernel oom, and when this happens the window 0 remains alive..or not, maybe it depends if screen was run manually or detached
2014-01-28 09:22:47	Soliton	[06:28:43] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits or gets killed or whatever since there is no other process in that window. with that script were you used stuff the window will stay since you started irssi from the shell.
2014-01-28 09:22:47	caveat-	[08:36:20] Soliton: and in order to have windows always alive after process terminated do I have to set zombie mode?

2014-01-28 12:39:05	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 12:39:05	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-28 12:39:05	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-28 12:39:05	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-28 12:39:05	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome

2014-01-28 12:39:05	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-28 12:39:05	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-28 12:39:05	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:05	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-28 12:39:05	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-28 12:39:05	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-28 12:39:05	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc

2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-01-28 12:39:05	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:21:39] ^A^Q
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[17:31:34] I use C-a c-X to destroy split

2014-01-28 12:39:05	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-28 12:39:05	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn

2014-01-28 12:39:05	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command

2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah

2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?

2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?

2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-28 12:39:05	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-28 12:39:05	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?

2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)

2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-28 12:39:05	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]

2014-01-28 12:39:05	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-28 12:39:05	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a

2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-28 12:39:05	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-28 12:39:05	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-28 12:39:05	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-28 12:39:05	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-28 12:39:05	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-01-28 12:39:05	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-01-28 12:39:05	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[22:41:03] hello all !
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[22:41:22] someone know that is the C-a O shortcut ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	RadoQ	[22:52:26] fe0dor, "man screenrc" can tell you.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	RadoQ	[22:52:35] oops, "man screen". ;)
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:07:52] RadoQ: no
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:08:05] there is nothing about this shortcut in my screen man
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:08:58] there is nothing about C-a O & C-a I
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:09:01] C-a ? lists the current shortcuts.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:09:29] there is nothing about C-a+O & C-a+I Soliton 
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:09:36] and not C-a :p
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:09:37] neither of those is a default sbinding.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:09:58] on my, it's default binding
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:10:12] C-a ? does not list C-a it is implicit to all bindings listed there.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:10:37] unless you mean C-a C-a which it does list.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:10:45] do you read what i write ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:10:59] i've said : C-a + O
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:11:06] do you see this O ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:11:11] yes.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:11:16] :p
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:11:24] there is no such default binding.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:11:34] maybe you meant C-a 0?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:11:35] but on my, there is this default binding
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:11:38] no no
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:12:02] you having some specific binding is pretty much the opposite of default.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:12:05] if i say to you the text on the bottom, can you tell me what it does ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:12:16] that's why i mentioned C-a ? which lists your bindings.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:12:23] oh sorry
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:13:13] i may have an idea if you paste the output of the command, sure.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:13:18] nothing
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:13:27] i check the output
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:13:50] you said something about "text on the bottom".
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:14:06] for C-a O that said : This window is already logged out
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:14:15] for the C-a ? : nothing about it
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:14:52] for C-a I that said : This window is now logged in
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:15:35] for C-a O that said : This window is no longer logged in
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:15:36] so C-a ? shows you a line with "O login on" and "I login off" presumably.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:15:49] no : nothing in C-a ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:16:01] i check again
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:16:24] nothing at all
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:16:30] seems like a common addition in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:16:57] and what that want mean ? :d
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:17:56] you're now allowed to consult the man page and ask more specific questions if it's still unclear.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:18:53] but i've tell you there it nothing about this shortcut in the man page
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:19:13] that is a joke ?
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:19:52] actually that very binding is mentioned verbatim as an example in my man page.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	RadoQ	[23:19:53] fe0dor, "man" just has default, if you don't find it there, it's not default. Then meta-'?' will help with you _current_ custom binding.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:20:12] either way you also know the command it invokes now.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:20:13] i've change nothing in this tool
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:20:16] NOTHING
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:20:31] it's not difficult to understand this
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:20:47] that's only the debian package
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:20:52] very likely it's in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:21:54] anyway, since you now know it's invoking the login command you can look that up in the man page.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:22:11] i've did it before asking you
2014-01-28 12:39:05	fe0dor	[23:22:22] and that's not like the -L option
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:22:29] certainly.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[23:28:51] i wonder if he has a very small terminal so he actually had to press space to see the custom bindings.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[05:25:37] Soliton: I've tried screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi, it works well if there isn't already a window 0, but if a window 0 already exists, it runs screen in a new window, leaving the window 0 too
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[05:28:40] the irssi process is killed by the kernel oom, and when this happens the window 0 remains alive..or not, maybe it depends if screen was run manually or detached
2014-01-28 12:39:05	Soliton	[06:28:43] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits or gets killed or whatever since there is no other process in that window. with that script were you used stuff the window will stay since you started irssi from the shell.
2014-01-28 12:39:05	caveat-	[08:36:20] Soliton: and in order to have windows always alive after process terminated do I have to set zombie mode?

2014-01-28 20:56:59	cousin_luigi	[20:53:42] Greetings.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	 *	cousin_luigi [20:54:38] just installed kde and screen stopped resizing along with the terminal; did he do something wrong or konsole needs some special setting? Thanks.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-28 20:56:59	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-28 20:56:59	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-28 20:56:59	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-28 20:56:59	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-28 20:56:59	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-28 20:56:59	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:59	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-28 20:56:59	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-28 20:56:59	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-28 20:56:59	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc

2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-01-28 20:56:59	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:21:39] ^A^Q
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[17:31:34] I use C-a c-X to destroy split

2014-01-28 20:56:59	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-28 20:56:59	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:09:07] Grr.

2014-01-28 20:56:59	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command

2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic

2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1

2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?

2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-01-28 20:56:59	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-28 20:56:59	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-28 20:56:59	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]

2014-01-28 20:56:59	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-28 20:56:59	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a

2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-28 20:56:59	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-28 20:56:59	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-28 20:56:59	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-28 20:56:59	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-28 20:56:59	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-01-28 20:56:59	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-01-28 20:56:59	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[22:41:03] hello all !
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[22:41:22] someone know that is the C-a O shortcut ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	RadoQ	[22:52:26] fe0dor, "man screenrc" can tell you.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	RadoQ	[22:52:35] oops, "man screen". ;)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:07:52] RadoQ: no
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:08:05] there is nothing about this shortcut in my screen man
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:08:58] there is nothing about C-a O & C-a I
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:09:01] C-a ? lists the current shortcuts.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:09:29] there is nothing about C-a+O & C-a+I Soliton 
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:09:36] and not C-a :p
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:09:37] neither of those is a default sbinding.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:09:58] on my, it's default binding
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:10:12] C-a ? does not list C-a it is implicit to all bindings listed there.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:10:37] unless you mean C-a C-a which it does list.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:10:45] do you read what i write ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:10:59] i've said : C-a + O
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:11:06] do you see this O ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:11:11] yes.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:11:16] :p
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:11:24] there is no such default binding.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:11:34] maybe you meant C-a 0?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:11:35] but on my, there is this default binding
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:11:38] no no
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:12:02] you having some specific binding is pretty much the opposite of default.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:12:05] if i say to you the text on the bottom, can you tell me what it does ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:12:16] that's why i mentioned C-a ? which lists your bindings.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:12:23] oh sorry
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:13:13] i may have an idea if you paste the output of the command, sure.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:13:18] nothing
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:13:27] i check the output
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:13:50] you said something about "text on the bottom".
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:14:06] for C-a O that said : This window is already logged out
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:14:15] for the C-a ? : nothing about it
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:14:52] for C-a I that said : This window is now logged in
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:15:35] for C-a O that said : This window is no longer logged in
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:15:36] so C-a ? shows you a line with "O login on" and "I login off" presumably.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:15:49] no : nothing in C-a ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:16:01] i check again
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:16:24] nothing at all
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:16:30] seems like a common addition in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:16:57] and what that want mean ? :d
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:17:56] you're now allowed to consult the man page and ask more specific questions if it's still unclear.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:18:53] but i've tell you there it nothing about this shortcut in the man page
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:19:13] that is a joke ?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:19:52] actually that very binding is mentioned verbatim as an example in my man page.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	RadoQ	[23:19:53] fe0dor, "man" just has default, if you don't find it there, it's not default. Then meta-'?' will help with you _current_ custom binding.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:20:12] either way you also know the command it invokes now.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:20:13] i've change nothing in this tool
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:20:16] NOTHING
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:20:31] it's not difficult to understand this
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:20:47] that's only the debian package
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:20:52] very likely it's in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:21:54] anyway, since you now know it's invoking the login command you can look that up in the man page.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:22:11] i've did it before asking you
2014-01-28 20:56:59	fe0dor	[23:22:22] and that's not like the -L option
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:22:29] certainly.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[23:28:51] i wonder if he has a very small terminal so he actually had to press space to see the custom bindings.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[05:25:37] Soliton: I've tried screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi, it works well if there isn't already a window 0, but if a window 0 already exists, it runs screen in a new window, leaving the window 0 too
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[05:28:40] the irssi process is killed by the kernel oom, and when this happens the window 0 remains alive..or not, maybe it depends if screen was run manually or detached
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[06:28:43] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits or gets killed or whatever since there is no other process in that window. with that script were you used stuff the window will stay since you started irssi from the shell.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	caveat-	[08:36:20] Soliton: and in order to have windows always alive after process terminated do I have to set zombie mode?
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Gedge	[14:07:51] caveat-: well, zombie mode will stop the window closing (it's not really alive)
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[17:05:03] caveat-: what Gedge said. if you want to return to the shell if irssi dies you need to use the stuff method (as in your script) also in your screenrc.
2014-01-28 20:56:59	Soliton	[17:06:11] zombie mode would be helpful to see the error and restart the process manually.

2014-01-31 16:50:31	cousin_luigi	[17:21:51] Greetings.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	cousin_luigi	[17:22:13] Do you happen to know if there are problems with konsole and screen when it comes to font resizing?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:59:25] hi is there a way I can logout from ssh without exiting screen, aside from just closing the terminal?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:59:37] (I am on an ssh session running screen)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[15:00:06] currently I have to 'detach' then 'exit' but I remember there is a way to do both on one step
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[16:01:34] JZA: set 'autodetach on'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[16:01:46] so, if you close the terminal, screen self-detaches
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[16:29:05] Gedge: what I want is to quit ssh from screen. 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	cousin_luigi	[17:01:06] bbl
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:03:54] JZA: didn't I discuss that with you last week?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:04:17] twb: yeah I think you did but you only told me to detach
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:04:22] ^M~. will cut the SSH off at its knees.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:04:24] detach will send me back to the regular prompt
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:04:34] oh, that didnt work
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:04:41] If you run "exec screen -R" instead of "screen -R", there will no parent shell to run "exit" in
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:04:53] I am using konsole
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:04:55] If you run "ssh example.net -t screen -R" you won't need to do that either
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:05:04] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:05:16] You can set your login shell to be screen, but that will break scp and rsync
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:05:27] What I do instead is have my .profile start screen automatically "when appropriate"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:05:32] http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.profile (near the bottom)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:09:41] I just remember there was either a keystroke or a command to exit both. 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:09:52] now that I remember it was a command, since I used to go to history for that. 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:10:00] i would have an 'exit screen' 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:12:44] I'm not aware of any such command
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:13:00] If you do work it out, please let me know
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:20:23] twb: thanks
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[19:06:39] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[19:06:41] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[05:15:51] btw I found it now... is C-a DD
2014-01-31 16:50:31	k_sze[work]	[11:55:31] ugh
2014-01-31 16:50:31	k_sze[work]	[11:55:39] I have two named screen sessions
2014-01-31 16:50:31	k_sze[work]	[11:55:43] foo and foobar
2014-01-31 16:50:31	k_sze[work]	[11:56:06] `screen -r foo` gives me the foobar session. What should I do?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:04:36] twb: btw i found the command is Ctrl-a DD 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:04:39] the one I was looking for 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:04:52] is a hard detach with logout included 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:04:53] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[14:16:37] Do you mean ^A^D^D ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[14:16:56] Because that's just passing ^A^D to screen (which detaches) and then ^D to the parent shell (which exits)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:19:21] nope, Ctrl-ADD
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[14:19:47] I am not familiar with that notation.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:19:50] actually 'a'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:19:56] well u learn something new everyday
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:20:03] ur welcome
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[14:20:16] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ElectricDuck	[17:12:47] Is there any way I can move to a different window by name?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	TauPan	[17:13:46] yup
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ElectricDuck	[17:13:54] ...
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ElectricDuck	[17:14:00] And how would I do that...
2014-01-31 16:50:31	TauPan	[17:14:10] I just had to ask my muscle memory
2014-01-31 16:50:31	TauPan	[17:14:20] ^A:select <name><RET>
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ElectricDuck	[17:14:52] Ah, thanks
2014-01-31 16:50:31	TauPan	[17:14:54] you can also put select window-name into a ~/.screenrc
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:11:06] hi, i'm trying to set up a shell account so that a screen session is automatically connected to or a new session created running a specific program
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:11:47] the -R option seems like a natural fit, but i've noticed that it doesn't respect additional command line options that would normally allow me to specify which command to run
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:12:04] ie, screen -R /usr/bin/zsh just runs bash, not zsh
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:12:21] does anyone know of a workaround for this?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:14:16] ah, i should have read the man page more thoroughly, looks like -s is what i want
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:24:52] hmm... i'm still having trouble getting -R to work properly...
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:25:26] it seems like "screen -R -l /usr/bin/vi" will create a new session each time
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:26:02] any ideas what i might be doing wrong?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	hamush	[03:31:29] i think i got it - "screen -xRR -l /usr/bin/vi" seems to work
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gorroth	[20:56:34] hi
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gorroth	[20:57:13] is there any way to add an env var to a currently running screen session?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gorroth	[20:57:31] for example, i want to set DISPLAY=localhost:10.0, but i don't want to kill and restart my screen session
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gorroth	[21:00:40] ah, i figured it out: screen -X setenv DISPLAY
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gorroth	[21:00:47] then enter localhost:10.0 at the sub-prompt
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:01:36] heya
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-01-31 16:50:31	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-01-31 16:50:31	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-01-31 16:50:31	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc

2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-01-31 16:50:31	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?

2014-01-31 16:50:31	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-01-31 16:50:31	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[06:20:00] -S oldname
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	g0tcha	[06:25:55] live and learn
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:09:07] Grr.

2014-01-31 16:50:31	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command
2014-01-31 16:50:31	markup`	[02:02:12] cool, thanks!

2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic

2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1

2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-01-31 16:50:31	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?

2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-01-31 16:50:31	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?

2014-01-31 16:50:31	Disconsented	[17:43:59] Question about screen: Everytime I detach a session (C + A D) it seems to stay there but is inactive, am I doing somthing wrong? http://i.imgur.com/R1YFVXm.png
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-01-31 16:50:31	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]

2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[11:54:38] hello
2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[14:34:45] (aka 'meta')
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-01-31 16:50:31	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-01-31 16:50:31	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-01-31 16:50:31	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-01-31 16:50:31	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-01-31 16:50:31	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-01-31 16:50:31	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-01-31 16:50:31	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-01-31 16:50:31	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[22:41:03] hello all !
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[22:41:22] someone know that is the C-a O shortcut ?
2014-01-31 16:50:31	RadoQ	[22:52:26] fe0dor, "man screenrc" can tell you.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	RadoQ	[22:52:35] oops, "man screen". ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[23:07:52] RadoQ: no
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[23:08:05] there is nothing about this shortcut in my screen man
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[23:08:58] there is nothing about C-a O & C-a I
2014-01-31 16:50:31	Soliton	[23:09:01] C-a ? lists the current shortcuts.
2014-01-31 16:50:31	fe0dor	[23:09:29] there is nothing about C-a+O & C-a+I Soliton 
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:09:36] and not C-a :p
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:09:37] neither of those is a default sbinding.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:09:58] on my, it's default binding
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:10:12] C-a ? does not list C-a it is implicit to all bindings listed there.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:10:37] unless you mean C-a C-a which it does list.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:10:45] do you read what i write ?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:10:59] i've said : C-a + O
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:11:06] do you see this O ?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:11:11] yes.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:11:16] :p
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:11:24] there is no such default binding.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:11:34] maybe you meant C-a 0?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:11:35] but on my, there is this default binding
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:11:38] no no
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:12:02] you having some specific binding is pretty much the opposite of default.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:12:05] if i say to you the text on the bottom, can you tell me what it does ?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:12:16] that's why i mentioned C-a ? which lists your bindings.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:12:23] oh sorry
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:13:13] i may have an idea if you paste the output of the command, sure.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:13:18] nothing
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:13:27] i check the output
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:13:50] you said something about "text on the bottom".
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:14:06] for C-a O that said : This window is already logged out
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:14:15] for the C-a ? : nothing about it
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:14:52] for C-a I that said : This window is now logged in
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:15:35] for C-a O that said : This window is no longer logged in
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:15:36] so C-a ? shows you a line with "O login on" and "I login off" presumably.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:15:49] no : nothing in C-a ?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:16:01] i check again
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:16:24] nothing at all
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:16:30] seems like a common addition in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:16:57] and what that want mean ? :d
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:17:56] you're now allowed to consult the man page and ask more specific questions if it's still unclear.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:18:53] but i've tell you there it nothing about this shortcut in the man page
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:19:13] that is a joke ?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:19:52] actually that very binding is mentioned verbatim as an example in my man page.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	RadoQ	[23:19:53] fe0dor, "man" just has default, if you don't find it there, it's not default. Then meta-'?' will help with you _current_ custom binding.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:20:12] either way you also know the command it invokes now.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:20:13] i've change nothing in this tool
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:20:16] NOTHING
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:20:31] it's not difficult to understand this
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:20:47] that's only the debian package
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:20:52] very likely it's in /etc/screenrc.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:21:54] anyway, since you now know it's invoking the login command you can look that up in the man page.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:22:11] i've did it before asking you
2014-01-31 16:50:32	fe0dor	[23:22:22] and that's not like the -L option
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:22:29] certainly.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[23:28:51] i wonder if he has a very small terminal so he actually had to press space to see the custom bindings.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	caveat-	[05:25:37] Soliton: I've tried screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi, it works well if there isn't already a window 0, but if a window 0 already exists, it runs screen in a new window, leaving the window 0 too
2014-01-31 16:50:32	caveat-	[05:28:40] the irssi process is killed by the kernel oom, and when this happens the window 0 remains alive..or not, maybe it depends if screen was run manually or detached
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[06:28:43] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits or gets killed or whatever since there is no other process in that window. with that script were you used stuff the window will stay since you started irssi from the shell.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	caveat-	[08:36:20] Soliton: and in order to have windows always alive after process terminated do I have to set zombie mode?
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Gedge	[14:07:51] caveat-: well, zombie mode will stop the window closing (it's not really alive)
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[17:05:03] caveat-: what Gedge said. if you want to return to the shell if irssi dies you need to use the stuff method (as in your script) also in your screenrc.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	Soliton	[17:06:11] zombie mode would be helpful to see the error and restart the process manually.
2014-01-31 16:50:32	kbni	[21:10:19] Greetings. I just had a kind of crazy idea pop into my head.. is there any way to output a "screenshot" of sorts from gnu screen? i.e. the actual text displayed in a current (say, just what's visible currently - not the entire buffer?)
2014-01-31 16:50:32	kbni	[21:11:30] nevermind, hardcopy is what I was after. thanks! :)

2014-02-04 04:37:42	oskie	hello. I use ssh with ControlMaster=auto which means that it will create new masters automatically. But it seems this causes issues with "hanging" windows - windows that don't close when you exit the process inside (the shell). Anyone else noticed this?
2014-02-04 04:38:01	oskie	I found http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526 and applied the patch, but it didn't help. At least not every time.
2014-02-04 04:43:11	oskie	c-a k works tho :) but it's a nasty/scary workaround
2014-02-04 04:43:57	ski	perhaps there's some background process left around
2014-02-04 04:44:11	oskie	yeah, I think it's the ssh process for the master connection
2014-02-04 04:44:42	oskie	wow that's strange. the window disappeared after ~5 seconds
2014-02-04 04:45:14	oskie	no, make that exactly 10 seconds
2014-02-04 04:45:30	ski	if i've started some X apps over SSH, sometimes the connection doesn't die when main shell ends (and X application terminated, afaik)
2014-02-04 04:45:44	ski	`^C' usually works then. not sure whether this is related to your situation
2014-02-04 04:45:54	ski	(also, i don't know what this has to do with Screen :)
2014-02-04 04:45:59	oskie	yes but in my case ^C doesn't work
2014-02-04 04:47:08	ski	perhaps `~&' could help

2014-02-04 06:21:27	frusen	i have my screen split into four sections. how can i specify which one i want to switch to?
2014-02-04 06:22:07	ski	`focus' ?
2014-02-04 06:22:28	ski	(possibly using `up',`down',`top',`bottom' for arguments)
2014-02-04 06:22:46	frusen	ah, thanks
2014-02-04 06:23:19	ski	typically `^A^I' is bound to `focus' (`^I' being sent by the `<Tab>' key)
2014-02-04 06:24:00	-->	blueyed (~daniel@hahler.de) が #screen に参加
2014-02-04 06:24:02	frusen	i'll just bind it to some keys
2014-02-04 06:25:03	ski	frusen : here's one option for that
2014-02-04 06:25:11	ski	  bindkey -k '#2' focus top     # <S-home>
2014-02-04 06:25:18	ski	  bindkey -k  *7  focus bottom  # <S-end>
2014-02-04 06:25:24	ski	  bindkey -k '#4' focus up      # <S-left>
2014-02-04 06:25:31	ski	  bindkey -k  %i  focus down    # <S-right>
2014-02-04 06:25:41	ski	(`S' being the `<Shift>' key)
2014-02-04 06:26:13	ski	(since these use `bindkey' rather than `bind', they don't require an initial `^A' escape)
2014-02-04 06:26:26	ski	is that helpful ?
2014-02-04 06:26:44	frusen	yes, thank you for the tip!
2014-02-04 06:27:49	ski	(that's using the termcap key capability names for the keys, rather than explicit escape sequences. meaning that it (hopefully) will work in more terminals than otherwise)
2014-02-04 06:35:21	frusen	i can't find a shifted cursor up/down, is there none?
2014-02-04 06:36:34	ski	i don't think there's any standard such, no :/
2014-02-04 06:41:36	frusen	i see, how can i remove the bindings i set with bindkey?
2014-02-04 06:42:03	ski	  bindkey -k  %i
2014-02-04 06:42:39	frusen	right, thanks

2014-02-05 11:32:15	twb	not sure
2014-02-05 11:32:22	twb	screen -dmSfoo -c bar.rc ?
2014-02-05 11:32:46	tonokip	ya except -dmSfoo in the rc
2014-02-05 11:33:00	tonokip	detach seems similar to -dm
2014-02-05 11:34:26	tonokip	might have to keep -m in a startup script tho
2014-02-05 11:34:54	tonokip	it doesnt seem to have a matching config option

2014-02-05 19:45:55	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-02-05 19:45:55	robonerd	[12:02:42] if i am within a screen in a shell, and have a program running (weechat) and i get disconnected, with screen by default (port installed on fbsd 9.2) keep weechat running/connected?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:08:39] I *think* that's the default behvaiour
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:08:43] Perhaps needs "autodetach on"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	robonerd	[12:10:44] how do i config screen for my local user account? 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	robonerd	[12:10:49] i generally just set up servers
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:11:01] I don't know what you mean by that.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:11:08] editor ~/.screenrc ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	robonerd	[12:11:43] well you said it needs autodetach on
2014-02-05 19:45:55	robonerd	[12:11:47] how do i set that?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:16:21] I said it might.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:16:26] You put that in ~/.screenrc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[12:16:37] It should be easy to test
2014-02-05 19:45:55	xeon123	[17:05:33] How I run this command with screen? ./test.sh >> output.txt
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[02:25:20] test
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:17:28] hello. When I launch a ssh master in a shell in a window in screen, and exit the shell, screen does not close the window.  I guess this is because the ssh master process, which is still running, has some fd open to the tty in the window. Right? Is there a way to work around this issue?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:31:18] yeah, starting the master as  'ssh -Nf host </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1' solves the issue... but I'd prefer to use 'ssh host' to start the master automatically
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[05:05:21] ah.. http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:17:28] master?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:22:38] ah
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[18:53:16] I'm using screen on a large monitor where my terminal window has 364 columns, but screen caption at the bottom is only using what looks like 250 columns
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[18:53:29] so I can't see the window titles of my higher numbered screens
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[18:53:43] I've tried Ctrl-A :width 364 but this makes no difference
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[18:53:45] any ideas?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:29:38] what's your caption command?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[23:23:09] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[23:23:36] the end bit of the date gets cut off around the 250 character mark
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[23:24:19] and the higher numbered windows aren't shown until you select one then it shows only the few remaining higher number windows on the left, like it's scrolled to the next section of window listings
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[08:34:47] Hi!  I know I can move between screen splits with C-a<TAB> and backwards by C-a<Shift><TAB>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[08:35:01] Since I have multiple splits, are there any other ways to move around?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[08:35:31] For instance, can I jump to the nth pane?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[10:32:21] dunpeal: u can jmp 2 left/right (with cursor-keys) and up/down with PagUp/Down
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[10:52:04] bluetoo: is that C-a<right-arrow>?  I can't get it to work
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[10:53:46] dunpeal: if C-a is ur prefix - then yes
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[10:55:02] bluetoo: doesn't work :(
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[10:55:23] which version? .. tmux -V
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[10:55:38] bluetoo: this is GNU screen :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[10:55:44] we are in #screen, right?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[10:55:59] lol - ur right .. my bad
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[11:01:49] dunpeal: ok on screen that would be: ':focus up.down.top.bottom' and u could 'bind j focus down' for instance so u dont have to go through com-mode
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dunpeal	[11:02:50] bluetoo: thanks!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	bluetoo	[11:03:33] yw .. not only in #screen but also in #tmux... ;)

2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[21:16:59] hi
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[21:17:22] i wonder how %? works in the hardstatus
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[21:18:54] ?      the  part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside the part expands to
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[21:18:56]               a non-empty string
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[21:19:02] where does the part end?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[21:30:05] obiwahn: it ends with the 2nd '%?'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:18:15] ah
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:18:22] :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:19:18] like %?foo%Xbar%?   | where x has to expand to non empty
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:19:21] :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:22:15] 133 #HOSTNAME - must be exportet in bashrc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:22:18] 134 hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%?%= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:22:34] brainwash: i have this set up some time ago
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:23:09] but somehow the coloring of active buffer/window does not work
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:23:23] it should be yellow
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:23:43] but when i am on the last it is always green
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[22:38:30] obiwahn: hardstatus string "%{= k}%{+b G}[ ${HOSTNAME} ][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{Y}(%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?)%{G}%?%+Lw%? %= ][ %{B}%Y-%m-%d %{G}%c ]"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[22:38:41] ^ you see the difference? :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:43:42] uhm
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:43:45] no
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:43:49] the spcae?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[22:43:52] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:45:14] :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:45:16] fixed
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[22:45:26] great :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[22:45:38] but why
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[22:46:47] magic.. I guess, not sure why it glitches without the space
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[16:21:28] re
2014-02-05 19:45:55	obiwahn	[16:21:48] is there a way to display the user of the current terminal
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:15:16] hey is there a command to split screen
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:15:31] like viewports
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[17:15:50] JZA: did you search for 'split' in the manpage?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[17:15:56] cos, it's there
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:18:15] it is, how do I switch between panes?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:18:22] there is no 'switch' around it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:18:50] ah C-a <tab>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JZA	[17:21:33] what about destroying the split... merging back?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[17:21:39] ^A^Q
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:31:34] I use C-a c-X to destroy split

2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[18:31:11] hihi
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[18:31:28] can I connect to a screen session on a different box?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[18:31:41] or should I always ssh to that box?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[18:34:35] dbolser: You must SSH to the box first, then attach. E.g. ssh -t user@host screen -r
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[19:25:06] rudi_s: ic, ty
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[19:25:32] we have a load ballancing ssh alias here, and I was wondering if there was some smarter way to use screen on box x to y
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:55:47] I'm trying to stop screen's caption from truncating to around 300 columns, it's supposed to auto-fill to width of the terminal which has always worked properly until I got a new 27" monitor
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:55:56] here is my screen caption from .screenrc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:55:57] caption always "%{= .G}[ %H | %-Lw%?%{B}%n*%f %t%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y ]"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[19:55:58] dbolser: No. There's no better way. screen just runs on the machine, the same like on the local system. To run it on the remote system, you have to get there first - which is what SSH is for.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:56:17] any ideas why it's not filling the last 100 columns when the rest of the terminal makes use of that space?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:57:19] only the screen caption stops around 250-300 columns, this causes the list of screen windows to be cut off and only display the upper numbered ones when I select one of them, then not showing the first 20, it's effectively showing me the second page of window titles in the caption bar
2014-02-05 19:45:55	dbolser	[19:57:55] rudi_s: OK,  many thanks
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[19:57:57] programs run within screen use all the columns till the end, it's only the caption that is truncating
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[19:58:02] np
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[19:58:34] fluxdude: Did you check the source? Maybe this is a limit in screen.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[19:58:52] (Never had that issue though and me screen is quite wide.)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	lewellyn	[19:58:53] fluxdude: i'd think it's 255 or 256 that it stops at.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	lewellyn	[19:58:59] i'd suggest what rudi_s suggested
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[22:28:12] fluxdude: what if you remove the %=?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[22:30:59] Apic: you can't afaik. i think there is a bug report for that.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Apic	[22:52:37] Soliton: Ok
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[22:58:50] Soliton: same
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[22:59:05] the end of the caption gets messed up like this:
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[22:59:06] | 14:58:58 Tue 14/%/%        
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[22:59:17] at the same point in the terminal
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fluxdude	[23:00:28] and the higher windows disappear aren't displayed until selected at which time the lower windows are replaced by the list of higher windows in the caption
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:42:56] i agree with the suggestion to check the source then that does sound like some buffer is too small.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:16:08] hey guys, quick question, to rename a screen session, its "screen -X 14349-0.host screenname" right?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:16:50] unknown command 'screenname'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:17:41] i meant "screen -X 14384-0.host irssi" for example
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:18:19] Well no, because that will be the same as typing ^A:irssi
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:18:39] 'sessionname' *is* a command, tho
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[06:19:01] -X sessionname
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:19:05] screen -X foo sessionname bar should do what you want
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:19:36] ah ok
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[06:19:37] screen -S oldname -X sessionname newname
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:19:39] makes sense now
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:19:52] but what if there are more then one screen session running?

2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[06:20:34] a screen session comprises many windows - do you want to name the session, or a window
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:21:53] i guess i dont understand the concept behind screen like i thought
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:22:01] for example, i have 2 screen sessions running irssi
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:22:10] 1 for freenode and 1 for another irc network
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:22:29] so when i 'screen -ls' i see 2 sessions detatched
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:23:07] Why not just use two tabs in a single screen session
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[06:23:22] I'd run both irssi processes in windows inside one session
2014-02-05 19:45:55	g0tcha	[06:24:30] i didnt know this can be done
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[06:25:00] now you do.

2014-02-05 19:45:55	markup`	[01:52:57] any way to reload screen for changes in .screenrc to take effect without have to restart entirely?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[02:00:30] markup`: you could reload the config file via "source <file"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[02:01:52] read the man page for more information about the source command

2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:20:14] hey does someone know how to bindkey to 2 actions?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[04:39:55] vaskozl_: try "eval"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:41:56] brainwash: hah it's you!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:42:09] i did to no avail :/
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:44:29] what did you try ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:48:33] I tried: eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:48:47] so I want an action to be executed everytime is switch to th 10th window
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:49:19] it ~0.2s to finish I think
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:49:28] ledoff that is
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:50:25] oh, that isn't what `eval' (nor `bindkey') does
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:50:46] it doesn't change the action of some particular Screen command invocation
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:51:01] `eval' invokes a sequence of Screen commands, in sequence
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:51:02] what do you mean?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:51:12] aren't these screen commands?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:51:33] `bindkey' binds a key (sequence), without the initial Screen escape, to a Screen command
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:51:36] vaskozl_ : they are
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:51:54] yes I know
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:52:17] your `eval "exec $HOME/bin/ledoff" "select 10"' will simply invoke those two Screen commands in order. it won't make the first be invoked any time you invoke the second
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:52:33] n my config I have bindkey -k k; eval "select 10" "exec $HOME/bin/blink"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:52:38] (perhaps i'm misunderstanding what you were attempting to do by that)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:52:50] I wan't the script to be run
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:52:53] bit it isn't
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:53:08] the ledoff one
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:53:22] eval doesn't execute it or let it finish
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:54:28] wait it just worked
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:54:29] hah
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:54:32] magic

2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:55:40] I found out where the problem was
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:55:43] hm, was just about to say it appears to work here
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:55:55] I have to have the script before the select 10 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:55:56] not after
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:55:56] (though i substituted another program for `ledoff')
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[04:57:45] how can I grep the number of the focused window in a screen session?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:00:09] screen -S $STY -Q @number | cut -d ' ' -f 1
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[05:00:15] gracias
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:00:29] might require the latest version of screen
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:01:17] and you don't need to pass -S  I think
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[05:03:39] brainwash: which version is this?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:04:37] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog

2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[05:05:22] brainwash: nope I'm setting up a mac
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[05:05:27] that's why all the hassle
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:06:11] did you skip step 1 of how to setup a mac? 1) remove mac os
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:06:13] :D
2014-02-05 19:45:55	vaskozl_	[05:06:22] brainwash: haha
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:27:31] there's also a `WINDOW' environment variable you could use (well, unless you have re`number'ed your Screen window (not sure whether the `-Q' solution handles this correctly))
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[05:33:21] ski: true, forgot about that one
2014-02-05 19:45:55	daixtr	[13:32:03] is using ctrl+6 which gives 0x1e a good ESCape key sequence to use for a terminal program?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[13:44:16] mayhaps
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[13:44:46] (though i'm not sure it gives `^^' in all terminals)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	daixtr	[13:47:12] see the values in `od -x`

2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:02:02] Hello. Is there a way to resize panes (regions? windows?) when using the (debian provided) GNU screen that has the famous "vertical split patch"? I need a resize that moves the boundary to the right, so that for example 75% of the screen is taken up by the left (region? pane?) and 25% by the right one.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[01:06:37] somian[wc]: the "resize" command can do this
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[01:07:07] read the man page for more detailed information
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:08:48] My resize command behaved very differently from what the manpage said
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[01:10:36] isn't there a vresize command, or similar?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:11:55] Maybe, let me check
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:12:20] Nope, not in this screen.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:12:52] All entries in the manpage for the :resize command pertain to horizontal resizing, brainwash.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[01:14:08] http://aperiodic.net/screen/region_management seems to mention it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[01:14:15] works for vertical and horizontal here
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:15:08] Heh, I just found that, Gedge!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:15:50] "As a special case, if the resize command is issued from a vertically-split region" [...]
2014-02-05 19:45:55	somian[wc]	[01:19:12] Goodbye, later, folks.

2014-02-05 19:45:55	jenia	[11:54:59] can someone please tell me how do i name a tty?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	jenia	[11:55:55] instead of there being "bash", i would like there to be something more meaninful
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[11:57:59] jenia: ^a A
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[11:58:27] Btw. the correct term in this case is window.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	jenia	[11:58:28] thanks a lot
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[11:58:33] np
2014-02-05 19:45:55	jenia	[14:08:45] how do i just to the beginning of the line?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	jenia	[14:08:58] ctrl-a doesnt work of course
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[14:34:17] jenia: C-a a

2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:22:47] Is it possible to display the hostname of the currently SSHed host in the status line?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:27:10] perhaps make the machine you connect to display the hostname in the hardstatus line ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:32:36] ski: Could you please give an example of what you are suggesting?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:34:56]   $ printf '\e]0;hardstatus text\a'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:35:14] puts `hardstatus text' into the hardstatus line of the Screen window
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:36:35] you could possibly make your shell (Bash ?) automatically do that when it starts up, putting the name of the current host into your hardstatus
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:37:16] you could possibly also include the current directory of the shell, updating it on every directory change in the shell, if you'd feel like that
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:37:51] ok ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:37:54] ski: Thanks. I'll try that out. :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:38:15] (i don't recall the way to do this in Bash, but istr there being a way)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:40:52] i suppose a more proper way to do this would be to say something like
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:41:10]   $ tput ts ; echo 'hardstatus text' ; tput fs
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:41:43] .. except that it seems like, at least here, the terminfo DB doesn't know that Screen supports the `ts' and `fs' capabilities
2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:49:41] http://www.tenshu.net/p/screenssh.html <-- There are couple of approaches discussed here
2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:53:30] ski: A suggestion from #linux was to use an screen's equivalent version of tmux command:  tmux neww -n $1 "ssh $1"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	matrix_	[02:54:20] kind of like a wrapper for ssh
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:55:12] yeah, that's an alternate approach
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:55:32] what i do is i keep the hostname in my shell prompt
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:55:58] and then i also add (more or less) the shell prompt (with working dir) to the hardstatus
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[02:56:28] screen -t hostname ssh hostname
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[02:56:52] and, using a "trick" i can see in the hardstatus, by the amount of "nesting", whether i'm on the outer (usually local) Screen session, or also in an inner (usually remote) session (or further nested, as the case may be)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:31] hm, since i found these useful, i'll mention them here :
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:34]   # `%u' in the format makes Screen crash ..
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:38]   # windowlist title 'Num Name%=Flags'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:43]   windowlist title 'Num Name%=Hardstatus%=Flags'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:48]   # windowlist string '%3n %t%=%f'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:52]   windowlist string '%3n %t%=%h%=%f'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:14:34] this adds hardstatus to windowlist. can be handy if your shell sets (e.g.) current dir in hardstatus (or if you nest Screen sessions often, e.g. behind SSH)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:09:00] is there any way to make a "permanent" screen session that's unclosable and created at boot?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[08:09:47] Why do you want that?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:13:18] twb, so I don't have to manually create the same screen session with 15 windows
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[08:15:01] Just write a .screenrc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[08:17:30] ruukasu: Or source a separate configuration script which opens the windows.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:18:26] could I use .screenrc to make a preset window names and commands automatically run in each window?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[08:18:44] Use e.g. screen irssi to spawn a window with irssi and stuff "foo^M" to enter foo return in a window ..
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[08:19:21] ruukasu: Yes. However I wouldn't do it in ~/.screenrc - but a custom file sourced on boot. Otherwise you can't open a new screen session without this setup.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[08:19:58] ruukasu: Use title "foo" to set the title of the current window to foo.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:28:55] also, screen seems to flicker occasionally, I've set vbell off but it still happens for no apparent reason sometimes
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:32:13] especially when I pgdn, the entire thing flickers for like 3 seconds
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[08:33:03] your terminal emulator might cause this
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:33:33] happens in tty too
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[08:37:03] maybe hardware/driver specific
2014-02-05 19:45:55	brainwash	[08:37:42] screen does not seem to cause strange flickers here
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ruukasu	[08:40:36] huh
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tb01110100	[08:46:59] Can the -X argument be given more than once?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	rudi_s	[08:56:59] tb01110100: TIAS?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[04:56:03] hi, i'm getting a weird issue, when screen size is limited to 80x25, but there are no other sessions that i know of, or see in session list. is there a way to reset the screen size?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:01:27] Myrth: are you in a windowing system? (a WM?)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:01:31] e.g. gnome
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:01:43] gedge: connecting through putty from windows
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:01:56] so, drag putty bigger?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:02:08] or double click the menubar?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:02:11] the putty is bigger. the screen session is limited to size smaller than window
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:02:20] seriously man
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:02:43] if you type   ^a *    how many users are connected?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:03:14] or run "screen -ls"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:03:25] it shows 2, how can i kill it?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:03:42] do you know which of them is "you" ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:03:46] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:06:34] screen -ls shows only 1 sesssion, which is mine
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:06:39] Myrth: I would detach from screen, then reattach with -dr (to detach any others)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:06:40] if the one you want to get rid of lists e.g. `/dev/pts/3' for `interface', then try something like `^A:at pts/3% detach' (or possibly `pow_detach' instead of `detach', if you want the process that is attached to Screen to HANGUP (logout))
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:06:46] Myrth ^
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:06:50] ^a * shows 2nd session which i'm not aware of
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:07:11] Gedge's suggestion would also work
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:07:19] Myrth:  ^a* shows a second connected *display* (not session)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:08:01] (there is only one session here (the one that contains your Screen windows), but multiple terminal displays may be attached to it at the same time)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:09:03] thanks :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:09:31] so just to understand the screen size will always be the smallest display?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:09:45] the first-connected
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:10:30]    ^size of
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:11:32] Gedge: doesn't look like it.. i've connected 2nd display, and resizing it changes window size of 1st connected display
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:11:43] i'm talking about pane size
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:11:58] Myrth : "the screen size will always be the smallest display" no
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:12:18] actually it's only making it smaller, i've resized 2nd putty window to be bigger, and it still limits to smallest it was
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:12:25] is there a way to reset pane size?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:12:29] if there's only one display viewing the window, it will autofit to that display's dimensions
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:12:57] if there's multiple display's, it won't auto-fit, you have to manually `fit' by `^AF'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Myrth	[05:13:10] ski: that's what i was looking for! thanks :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:13:32] I wasn't talking about pane size.  I think!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:13:39] iow, that will resize the window to the actual size of the display (really the region in the display, if more than one)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	 *	ski [05:14:00] isn't sure what "pane size" is here, exactly
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[05:15:39] hm, docs say you can also use `width' and `height' with `-w' flag to resize (only) the window
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[05:15:42] split window (into panes)?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[19:52:17] hi!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[19:52:36] I run emacs frmo inside GNU screen.....     and from windows via putty, so to speak
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[19:53:03] emacs often has F3 and F4 as shortcut keys for functions, and i can do that if i just run emacs from a plain bash prompt. 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[19:53:48] But if i run it from inside screen, emacs doesnt really pick them up any more. F keys just give a terminal bell and a tilde. What should i look into?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[20:43:27] sybariten: are you lying about TERM before/after starting screen?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[21:29:33] hm, lying?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[21:30:15] setting it to somethign wrong
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[22:14:21] he quit  :-(
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[01:02:16] check the keyboard settings in putty.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	sybariten	[01:45:15] Soliton: i dont think thats the solution.... but i will do so
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[04:44:31] if you find settings that make your terminal behave as screen/emacs expects i'd call that a solution.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	mycophile	[21:16:25] Hi, having a minor issue. Pretty sure it's screen related but not entirely sure. I've got a nicklist script for irssi, and there's a .. "border" kind of where the nicklist starts. Wasn't always there, not sure how to get rid of it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	mycophile	[21:16:38] Can take a screen shot if necessary
2014-02-05 19:45:55	mycophile	[21:29:17] http://imageshack.com/a/img62/2986/2r2h.jpg
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[21:30:50] mycophile: might be the TERM setting within screen (usually 'screen') doesn't render that line the same as outside screen
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[21:31:11] before you run irssi, try TERM=whatever_term_was_before_screen
2014-02-05 19:45:55	 *	Gedge [21:31:23] will probably get flamed for this.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[21:31:38] fiddling with TERM considered ungood
2014-02-05 19:45:55	mycophile	[19:35:30] Anyone else have an idea?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:18:33] hello, is there a way to prevent sending input to a window?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[17:18:48] Don't open it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:19:00] i have a long running process in a window and I don't want to Ctrl-C it by mistake (has happened many times before...)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[17:19:22] fix your program to not trap INT then
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:19:43] but i may want to INT it. just not now.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[17:19:56] kill -15 it instead
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:21:26] I guess I could use something like 'stty intr <obscurekey>'
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:05:22] hi, I'm using this bash script in order to automatically run a detached screen session with irssi or, if already a session named "irssi" exists, but there is no irssi, just run irssi in that session
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:05:27] http://sprunge.us/HjZc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:06:11] but this works only if there is a window with number 0
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:06:37] I would like ti check if there is a window 0, and if not create one
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:08:02] my .screenrc http://sprunge.us/Rfej
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:12:40] you're also assuming that window 0 contains a shell. i'd just use: screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:19:35] Soliton: will this work even when say there is all my 4 screen windows (0,1,2,3) and in the 0 one the irssi process killed? 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:20:50] I mean window 0 still alive after the irssi process that contained was killed
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:21:02] Hey guys, how do i run screen on another user?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:21:12] I get "Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/1' - please check."
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:25:49] turn on multiuser mode or just login as the other user.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:27:40] caveat-: not sure what you're exactly asking. if there is already a window 0 the window will get the next free number.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:28:04] on my user screen works fine
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:28:15] ive created a new user on the system and tried screen with that and i get that error ^
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:29:06] because you did not login as that user but used su or whatever.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:29:12] I see
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:29:30] I don't want to have to login, can screen not work if i su to that user?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:30:41] it tells you why it can't. you can also hack around it by changing the permissions accordingly.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	JaseW	[19:31:12] its ok i found the answer: http://superuser.com/questions/342460/use-gnu-screen-when-sshed-as-a-user-but-su-as-another
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:38:47] Soliton: I want that if irssi process, that is in window 0, has been killed and window 0 is still alive, be run again in window 0 (that Check_screen.sh script http://sprunge.us/HjZc is executed only few minutes as a cronjob).
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:39:37] if window 0 is no longer alive, then I would like it's created with irssi in it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:40:20] maybe I have to use the screen -Q windows parameter 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:44:34] screen -Q select 0  gives me exit status 0, ok, but if I try: screen -Q select 5 (5 is non existent window), echo $? outputs 0 again..I would have expected 1
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:48:18] s/executed only/executed every
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:57:17] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits unless you turned zombie on. so i'd still go with what i suggested.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[19:58:29] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[19:58:51] you could somehow check if a window 0 is there but you'd also have to check it's a shell ready to run a command... lots of assumptions.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[22:41:03] hello all !
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[22:41:22] someone know that is the C-a O shortcut ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	RadoQ	[22:52:26] fe0dor, "man screenrc" can tell you.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	RadoQ	[22:52:35] oops, "man screen". ;)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:07:52] RadoQ: no
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:08:05] there is nothing about this shortcut in my screen man
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:08:58] there is nothing about C-a O & C-a I
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:09:01] C-a ? lists the current shortcuts.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:09:29] there is nothing about C-a+O & C-a+I Soliton 
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:09:36] and not C-a :p
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:09:37] neither of those is a default sbinding.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:09:58] on my, it's default binding
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:10:12] C-a ? does not list C-a it is implicit to all bindings listed there.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:10:37] unless you mean C-a C-a which it does list.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:10:45] do you read what i write ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:10:59] i've said : C-a + O
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:11:06] do you see this O ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:11:11] yes.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:11:16] :p
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:11:24] there is no such default binding.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:11:34] maybe you meant C-a 0?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:11:35] but on my, there is this default binding
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:11:38] no no
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:12:02] you having some specific binding is pretty much the opposite of default.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:12:05] if i say to you the text on the bottom, can you tell me what it does ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:12:16] that's why i mentioned C-a ? which lists your bindings.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:12:23] oh sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:13:13] i may have an idea if you paste the output of the command, sure.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:13:18] nothing
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:13:27] i check the output
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:13:50] you said something about "text on the bottom".
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:14:06] for C-a O that said : This window is already logged out
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:14:15] for the C-a ? : nothing about it
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:14:52] for C-a I that said : This window is now logged in
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:15:35] for C-a O that said : This window is no longer logged in
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:15:36] so C-a ? shows you a line with "O login on" and "I login off" presumably.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:15:49] no : nothing in C-a ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:16:01] i check again
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:16:24] nothing at all
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:16:30] seems like a common addition in /etc/screenrc.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:16:57] and what that want mean ? :d
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:17:56] you're now allowed to consult the man page and ask more specific questions if it's still unclear.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:18:53] but i've tell you there it nothing about this shortcut in the man page
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:19:13] that is a joke ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:19:52] actually that very binding is mentioned verbatim as an example in my man page.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	RadoQ	[23:19:53] fe0dor, "man" just has default, if you don't find it there, it's not default. Then meta-'?' will help with you _current_ custom binding.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:20:12] either way you also know the command it invokes now.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:20:13] i've change nothing in this tool
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:20:16] NOTHING
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:20:31] it's not difficult to understand this
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:20:47] that's only the debian package
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:20:52] very likely it's in /etc/screenrc.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:21:54] anyway, since you now know it's invoking the login command you can look that up in the man page.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:22:11] i've did it before asking you
2014-02-05 19:45:55	fe0dor	[23:22:22] and that's not like the -L option
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:22:29] certainly.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[23:28:51] i wonder if he has a very small terminal so he actually had to press space to see the custom bindings.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[05:25:37] Soliton: I've tried screen -S irssi -X screen 0 irssi, it works well if there isn't already a window 0, but if a window 0 already exists, it runs screen in a new window, leaving the window 0 too
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[05:28:40] the irssi process is killed by the kernel oom, and when this happens the window 0 remains alive..or not, maybe it depends if screen was run manually or detached
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[06:28:43] according to your screenrc the window will be gone when irssi quits or gets killed or whatever since there is no other process in that window. with that script were you used stuff the window will stay since you started irssi from the shell.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	caveat-	[08:36:20] Soliton: and in order to have windows always alive after process terminated do I have to set zombie mode?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[14:07:51] caveat-: well, zombie mode will stop the window closing (it's not really alive)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[17:05:03] caveat-: what Gedge said. if you want to return to the shell if irssi dies you need to use the stuff method (as in your script) also in your screenrc.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Soliton	[17:06:11] zombie mode would be helpful to see the error and restart the process manually.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	kbni	[21:10:19] Greetings. I just had a kind of crazy idea pop into my head.. is there any way to output a "screenshot" of sorts from gnu screen? i.e. the actual text displayed in a current (say, just what's visible currently - not the entire buffer?)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	kbni	[21:11:30] nevermind, hardcopy is what I was after. thanks! :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ozymandias	[07:01:41] I want to start a handful of processes in screen via @reboot in cron -- is there any way to have them all start in new windows of the same named screen?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[07:03:14] ozymandias: yes, put "screen -t foo foo" lines into ~/.screenrc-boot "@reboot screen -dm -C ~/.screenrc-boot"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ozymandias	[07:03:24] ty
2014-02-05 19:45:55	Gedge	[07:03:24] -c
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:37:42] hello. I use ssh with ControlMaster=auto which means that it will create new masters automatically. But it seems this causes issues with "hanging" windows - windows that don't close when you exit the process inside (the shell). Anyone else noticed this?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:38:01] I found http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714526 and applied the patch, but it didn't help. At least not every time.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:43:11] c-a k works tho :) but it's a nasty/scary workaround
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:43:57] perhaps there's some background process left around
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:44:11] yeah, I think it's the ssh process for the master connection
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:44:42] wow that's strange. the window disappeared after ~5 seconds
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:45:14] no, make that exactly 10 seconds
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:45:30] if i've started some X apps over SSH, sometimes the connection doesn't die when main shell ends (and X application terminated, afaik)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:45:44] `^C' usually works then. not sure whether this is related to your situation
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:45:54] (also, i don't know what this has to do with Screen :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:45:59] yes but in my case ^C doesn't work
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[04:47:08] perhaps `~&' could help
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[04:58:13] very strange, i thought initially it was an 'open fd' issue... but /proc/<pid of ssh process>/fd shows no fds from the shell
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:21:27] i have my screen split into four sections. how can i specify which one i want to switch to?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:22:07] `focus' ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:22:28] (possibly using `up',`down',`top',`bottom' for arguments)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:22:46] ah, thanks
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:23:19] typically `^A^I' is bound to `focus' (`^I' being sent by the `<Tab>' key)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:24:02] i'll just bind it to some keys
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:03] frusen : here's one option for that
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:11]   bindkey -k '#2' focus top     # <S-home>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:18]   bindkey -k  *7  focus bottom  # <S-end>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:24]   bindkey -k '#4' focus up      # <S-left>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:31]   bindkey -k  %i  focus down    # <S-right>
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:25:41] (`S' being the `<Shift>' key)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:26:13] (since these use `bindkey' rather than `bind', they don't require an initial `^A' escape)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:26:26] is that helpful ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:26:44] yes, thank you for the tip!
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:27:49] (that's using the termcap key capability names for the keys, rather than explicit escape sequences. meaning that it (hopefully) will work in more terminals than otherwise)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:35:21] i can't find a shifted cursor up/down, is there none?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:36:34] i don't think there's any standard such, no :/
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:41:36] i see, how can i remove the bindings i set with bindkey?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	ski	[06:42:03]   bindkey -k  %i
2014-02-05 19:45:55	frusen	[06:42:39] right, thanks
2014-02-05 19:45:55	stobix	[23:39:20] Yo. How do I get screen to not set TERM to screen in all new shells, but instead have it as $TERM?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	stobix	[23:42:20] Or, to put it in another way: Right now, every time I do a C-a C, I have to "export TERM=xterm" to be ablet on interpret ^H et al. This is not desirable.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	stobix	[23:42:36] s/ablet on/able to/
2014-02-05 19:45:55	stobix	[23:45:18] ah. found it. Thanks for being my rubber duckie, #screen. ;)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[10:39:19] how can i have one shell script create and run multiple commands in seperate windows in a single screen session?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[10:40:21] Either use a screenrc instead, or use "screen -X screen foo"
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[10:46:57] hmm any good documentation on .screenrc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[10:49:45] screen cmd1 \n screen cmd2
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[10:49:53] hope thats all i need, lol
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[10:56:06] Yes
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[10:56:32] either in ~/.screenrc (default) or in another file and use screen -C foo.rc IIRC
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[10:56:42] screen -c foo.rc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:27:20] screenrc seems good so far
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:27:42] looking to see if i can specify similar to -dmS in the config
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:30:14] just "detach" i guess
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:30:55] and sessionname
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[11:32:15] not sure
2014-02-05 19:45:55	twb	[11:32:22] screen -dmSfoo -c bar.rc ?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:32:46] ya except -dmSfoo in the rc
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:33:00] detach seems similar to -dm
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:34:26] might have to keep -m in a startup script tho
2014-02-05 19:45:55	tonokip	[11:34:54] it doesnt seem to have a matching config option
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:08:32] asd
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:09:17] Hi folks, I would like to solve some problem with screen but I need to compila screen with debug parameters which prints out more logging information
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:09:33] Can somebody help me?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:11:00] I have some RedHat BZ which I would like to solve.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:35:13] what's the problem with the compilation?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	oskie	[17:35:19] specific questions are always good :)
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:48:54] When I compile screen I am not able to see in some log messages which are in sources mentioned like debug, debug2 etc.
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[17:49:42] May be better say how enable? Some .screenrc modifications?
2014-02-05 19:45:55	phracek	[19:24:21] oskie: ^^

2014-02-11 04:52:53	jirido	Hi.. I wonder if it is normal that screen runs as root without me explicit tell it to?
2014-02-11 04:55:52	ski	possibly you have setuid `root' on the executable ?
2014-02-11 04:56:09	ski	(which is required to be able to run multiuser sessions)
2014-02-11 04:57:24	jirido	you mean to be able to use sudo also or multi "users"..  is this defaut on installs
2014-02-11 04:59:28	jirido	ski:  Is rning programs as root or use sudo conts as multiusers?
2014-02-11 04:59:46	jirido	Does running*
2014-02-11 05:01:17	ski	no, i'm not talking about `sudo'
2014-02-11 05:02:17	jirido	Ok
2014-02-11 05:02:24	ski	i'm talking about one user being able to attach to the session of another user, directly (after the other user has explicitly allowed that first user to attach, and perhaps even affect rather than only view the session, e.g.)
2014-02-11 05:03:05	ski	see the `multiuser' and the `acl...' Screen commands
2014-02-11 05:04:57	jirido	Ok..so then i turn that damn bit of then.. just now im alone on this mashine and dont want anyone to attach.. Thank you.. 
2014-02-11 05:08:08	ski	well, people can't attach until and unless you say `multiuser on' in the session
2014-02-11 05:09:01	ski	also, iirc, they can't even attach then, untill you've added some permissions for them into the Screen session (so it knows about their existence, and their permissions)
2014-02-11 05:17:14	jirido	ski: I got the problem that other programs getting rootn access without asking and maybe it is running screen that makes it.. Is there a start -switch to run as user ?
2014-02-11 05:18:38	jirido	Well never mind i can switch on and of that bit for some times.. Thank you.
2014-02-11 05:23:22	ski	i don't think starting other processes through setuid `root' Screen would start then as `root'
2014-02-11 05:26:02	jirido	ski:  no it is so that diferent programs that should ask for password dont but give right to modify rootfiles.. might as you say have nothing with root to do.. it just seemed od to me to se screen running as root in my taskmanager as i did not start it as such.
2014-02-11 05:31:58	ski	anyway, it's fine to disable the setuid bit, if you don't care about multi-user Screen sessions

2014-02-11 06:09:23	Voyage	thanks
2014-02-11 06:09:23	ski	(or `r' instead of `x', if you don't want to allow multiple attach)
2014-02-11 06:09:55	ski	if you use e.g. `-xRS' it will create the session if it doesn't exist, otherwise attaching

2014-02-12 08:12:24	kruug	I'm looking to create a start-up script that runs a few programs in different screen sessions.  Is there a switch that creates the screen, starts a program in that screen, and then disconnects?
2014-02-12 08:12:42	kruug	much like, `screen -S irc irssi` but with a detach option
2014-02-12 08:13:10	twb	screen -dm -S irc irssi ?
2014-02-12 08:13:49	kruug	ah...good point.  I skimmed the man page too quickly, it appears.
2014-02-12 08:13:51	kruug	thanks twb 
2014-02-12 08:14:04	twb	manpage is not really set up for discovering featurse

2014-02-12 23:43:05	sybariten	i'm pretty sure i fucked up my screen behaviour a bit by doing ctrl,a,C ... although i cant see antyijg about capital C
2014-02-12 23:43:45	sybariten	what happened is i "cleared and reset" my screen so everghtuing was blank and now i dont see anyting in each char slot until there is some new text there... if you understand
2014-02-12 23:44:06	sybariten	basicly i'd need to quit my irc client and restart it but im not too keen on that
2014-02-12 23:44:22	sybariten	oh wait, hand on, a simple window resize helped

2014-02-12 23:58:37	sybariten	also, i need to open another window, in this screen ... if that is the correct terminology. Normally i have a script that does this from the beginning but now ive lost one of the windows. is it ctrl, a, c i wanna do?

2014-02-13 00:06:38	sybariten	hm, ok
2014-02-13 00:08:32	ski	several applications will interpret `^L' as a command for redisplaying the current output screen
2014-02-13 00:09:08	ski	(also Screen binds `^A^L' and `^Al' to `redisplay')

2014-02-13 18:53:37	jirido	Hi. I see my nightwatch is not here but maybe some one else could be cind to tell me if one can click links with screen somehow and in sucha case HOW? Would LOVE you for that!
2014-02-13 18:54:46	Soliton	how do you click links in your terminal without screen?
2014-02-13 18:55:34	jirido	Lol i dont know, im on knee
2014-02-13 18:56:13	jirido	Bleeding mousehand.. But tell me then::!!
2014-02-13 18:57:17	jirido	The day i gona squash that mouse is SOON!
2014-02-13 18:57:18	Soliton	so, that doesn't sound like this question has anything to do with screen. :-)
2014-02-13 18:57:43	Soliton	i've got a setting for urxvt to open urls with a right click.
2014-02-13 18:57:55	Soliton	really depends on the terminal you're using.
2014-02-13 18:58:06	jirido	Well .. Screen has some funktions that extend bash soo.. but this start to sound like a NO :(
2014-02-13 18:58:18	jirido	Bash!
2014-02-13 18:58:32	jirido	Should i change?
2014-02-13 18:58:50	Soliton	you're confused... maybe just explain what you want to achieve.
2014-02-13 18:59:17	jirido	I do love screen mainly for multiplexing and copy/paste
2014-02-13 19:00:17	jirido	Im in irssi and want to click links so i dont have to reache for mouse between going to the browser
2014-02-13 19:00:54	jirido	No Im not confused, Ignorant maybe but on the path..
2014-02-13 19:01:19	Soliton	try the openurl script for irssi.
2014-02-13 19:01:45	Soliton	/script install openurl
2014-02-13 19:03:42	jirido	Hmm okej thats right.. I have one that is url plot and it well it dont work and i hoped screen would have some magick key to its coppy mode..
2014-02-13 19:04:05	jirido	Hrmmff
2014-02-13 19:04:32	jirido	Ok So i know.. Thank you!
2014-02-13 19:05:08	Soliton	no problem. in the future i would advise to not describe opening URLs with "clicking links" when you don't even want to use a mouse. :-P
2014-02-13 19:05:08	jirido	And a pleasant continuin on the good day My friend!
2014-02-13 19:06:00	jirido	Bang my head to the screen untill it happens ..then..!!??
2014-02-13 19:07:11	jirido	Bite the keybord.. jump up and down screeming starring att the mouse
2014-02-13 19:07:58	jirido	Thank you for the advice i'll put it behind my ear.
2014-02-13 19:08:12	Soliton	no worries. good luck.
2014-02-13 19:08:25	jirido	Thaqnks!

2014-02-19 10:46:41	shifty_28	[07:27:28] I have a usb device that brings in input through /dev/tty.usbdevice at 4800 baud. I'm using screen (i.e., screen /dev/tty.usbdevice 4800) to retrieve the input. that's fine, but I need to redirect the output to stdout or the like. I can redirect to a file (using -L) but there is a delay due to buffering
2014-02-19 10:46:41	kbni	[08:33:30] I'm looking at setting up a wiki or something for documentation, but the main thing I want is that a user can look at an article and see straight away what has changed (due to it being highlighted or having a marker or something)

2014-02-21 09:56:18	[3]nertia	Hello there! So, I'm trying to play with this caption line 'caption string "Test 1"' in /etc/screenrc but it doesn't seem to be doing anything?
2014-02-21 10:25:02	rudi_s	[3]nertia: The caption is normally only display in splits IIRC. Use caption always "..." to display them even without splits.
2014-02-21 10:25:39	rudi_s	And btw. modifying /etc/screenrc is not a good idea because it affects all users on the system. Better use ~/.screenrc - also makes it easer to use it on other systems.
2014-02-21 10:25:46	rudi_s	man screen for details.
2014-02-21 10:50:59	[3]nertia	rudi_s: Tried that too; no result
2014-02-21 10:51:13	[3]nertia	Even tried specifying the config
2014-02-21 10:56:24	[3]nertia	rudi_s: Also, this box is going to be a dev environment for just me so I figured the global screenrc was fine. Either way, I tried a ~/.screenrc as well just to see
2014-02-21 10:56:41	[3]nertia	Not sure what's going on :S

2014-02-21 21:20:46	[3]nertia	rudi_s: Of course
2014-02-21 21:20:54	rudi_s	[3]nertia: Well, it's not in your screenrc.
2014-02-21 21:20:59	[3]nertia	I also tested that one by opening more than one
2014-02-21 21:21:03	[3]nertia	rudi_s: I figured as much lol
2014-02-21 21:21:14	rudi_s	Btw. to test stuff, minimize it. Just a single line and then start a new screen.
2014-02-21 21:21:37	[3]nertia	rudi_s: I don't catch your meaning?
2014-02-21 21:22:14	rudi_s	[3]nertia: Minimize the configuration file! Use just the options you require to test the issue. This makes it easier for you and for people trying to help.
2014-02-21 21:22:25	rudi_s	So create a ~/.screenrc which just contains the single line:
2014-02-21 21:22:29	rudi_s	caption always "test 1"
2014-02-21 21:22:55	[3]nertia	Ah
2014-02-21 21:22:56	rudi_s	And then start a new screen (in a new terminal) with screen.
2014-02-21 21:22:57	[3]nertia	Right
2014-02-21 21:23:28	rudi_s	And I tested that, and it works fine. So something must be wrong on your end. Either you didn't edit the correct file or didn't start a new screen (it doesn't help to start a new window in the current session) or something else is wrong.

2014-02-21 21:30:21	[3]nertia	Well, I tried echo $term all it says is linux
2014-02-21 21:30:47	[3]nertia	It's been awhile since I've been on linux, please forgive my ignorance. There's a lot I've forgotten heh
2014-02-21 21:30:57	rudi_s	[3]nertia: Actually it's echo $TERM - ok, that sounds fine.
2014-02-21 21:31:25	[3]nertia	Yeah, sorry. Case problem. I indeed did use $TERM
2014-02-21 21:32:18	rudi_s	[3]nertia: Logout of the vt and login again. Then make sure the .screenrc only contains the line and then start screen.

2014-02-24 05:38:38	YourBestFriend	it's a tmux question I have but tmux users don't want to answer me
2014-02-24 05:38:53	ski	ok
2014-02-24 05:39:02	YourBestFriend	although they are 5 times as many as here
2014-02-24 05:39:09	YourBestFriend	do you know tmux?
2014-02-24 05:39:15	ski	only very little
2014-02-24 05:39:27	ski	perhaps someone else in here can answer for you, though
2014-02-24 05:39:36	ski	(but only if you actually ask your question)
2014-02-24 05:40:00	ski	(and stick around long enough for them to notice the question, usually meaning at least a couple of hours)
2014-02-24 05:40:00	YourBestFriend	here's my question: when I bringup a menu such as Ctrl+b w, I want to be able to use vim bindings instead of the arrow keys, how do I do that?
2014-02-24 05:41:13	YourBestFriend	well, there are vim bindings already, it seems, I just want to remap them (I'm using a dvorak keyboard layout)
2014-02-24 05:52:20	ski	  set-window-option mode-keys vi
2014-02-24 05:52:32	ski	appears to set Vi keys mode
2014-02-24 05:57:09	ski	  bind-key -t vi-choice h down
2014-02-24 05:57:54	-->	maroloccio (~marolocci@93-44-154-62.ip97.fastwebnet.it) has joined #screen
2014-02-24 05:58:04	ski	seems to work to set `h' for moving down in the window selection of `^Bw' (command `choose-window')
2014-02-24 05:58:09	ski	YourBestFriend : does that help ?
2014-02-24 06:10:07	YourBestFriend	ski: thank you!
2014-02-24 06:10:40	ski	i found out the about by reading a bit in `man tmux', and testing a few commands
2014-02-24 06:10:47	ski	s/about/above/
2014-02-24 06:11:24	ski	perhaps you should try to learn to read the manpage of TMux, finding relevant stuff in it, if you want to use it ?
2014-02-24 06:11:29	ski	just a suggestion
2014-02-24 06:12:12	YourBestFriend	the manpage is like 2435234 pages long
2014-02-24 06:12:22	YourBestFriend	I read it once and forgot all about it
2014-02-24 06:15:04	ski	seems quite a bit shorter than the manpage for Screen
2014-02-24 06:15:49	ski	it's good practice to learn the habit of how to skim and find the piece of information you're looking for, in a largeish man page
2014-02-24 06:16:10	ski	(at least if you want to customize)
2014-02-24 06:18:22	YourBestFriend	well I found most of what I wanted to customize using Google
2014-02-24 06:18:28	YourBestFriend	but the vim bindings I couldn't
2014-02-24 06:19:38	YourBestFriend	what's "vi-copy"?
2014-02-24 06:20:06	ski	apparently the Vi version of the bindings used in copy mode and scroll mode
2014-02-24 06:22:33	YourBestFriend	I have never used copy mode and scroll mode =/
2014-02-24 06:23:02	YourBestFriend	looks like I tried to edit the vi-choice bindings in the past but ended up changing vi-copy instead
2014-02-24 06:23:39	ski	if you ever need to scroll back to stuff that has scrolled off the display, and possibly want to copy from it, then now you know where to look
2014-02-24 06:27:34	YourBestFriend	hmmmmmmm

2014-02-27 10:48:09	 *	jmpp_ greets
2014-02-27 10:48:11	jmpp_	!
2014-02-27 10:48:43	jmpp_	I'm trying to run screen from a script with -d -m to have it detach immediately and keep on running forever a specific command
2014-02-27 10:49:03	jmpp_	but I'm seeing that the script terminates immediately and screen -ls doesn't show my requested session running in detached mode
2014-02-27 10:49:21	jmpp_	my script basically amounts to this: ${SCREEN} -U -S "Console continous compilation" -d -m -c ${SCREENRC} ${GRUNT} --gruntfile ${GRUNTFILE} ${TARGET}
2014-02-27 10:49:28	jmpp_	with the variables properly defined, of course
2014-02-27 10:49:38	twb	Turn on zombie mode
2014-02-27 10:49:52	twb	Your program is probably just crashing so screen goes "oh, done!" and closes
2014-02-27 10:51:29	jmpp_	I already figured it out: my script was running /usr/bin/screen, while I was running screen -ls with MacPorts' screen binary found on /opt/local/bin
2014-02-27 10:51:32	jmpp_	silly me!
2014-02-27 10:51:34	jmpp_	my script was working fine
2014-02-27 10:51:46	jmpp_	but, other than that, I've always wondered about something like zombie mode
2014-02-27 10:51:54	jmpp_	to be able to read screen's output just before it exists
2014-02-27 10:51:59	jmpp_	how do I do that?
2014-02-27 10:52:19	 *	jmpp_ is embarrased to admit he has tried to read faster than light to catch screen's output before it dies
2014-02-27 10:53:14	jmpp_	holy crap! now that I'm explicitly running /usr/bin/screen -ls I see a dozen screen sessions running that I unknowingly started while hunting for this problem!
2014-02-27 10:53:36	jmpp_	any way to kill a bunch of screen sessions all at once?
2014-02-27 10:53:45	twb	er defzombie on ?
2014-02-27 10:53:56	jmpp_	on screenrc
2014-02-27 10:53:56	jmpp_	?
2014-02-27 10:53:57	twb	(re first question)
2014-02-27 10:54:04	twb	http://cyber.com.au/~twb/.screenrc
2014-02-27 10:54:09	jmpp_	cheers!
2014-02-27 10:54:46	jmpp_	so, any idea on how to kill a bunch of screen sessions all at once?
2014-02-27 10:55:03	twb	I guess to kill them you'd do something like for i in $(screen -ls | magic); do screen -S "$i" -X quit; done
2014-02-27 10:55:17	twb	Or just kill them all with something like "pkill -9 SCREEN"
2014-02-27 10:55:21	jmpp_	OK, so no built-in way
2014-02-27 10:55:24	jmpp_	OK
2014-02-27 10:55:26	twb	nope
2014-02-27 10:55:35	jmpp_	about your screenrc file, I don't see a zombiemode there..
2014-02-27 10:55:43	twb	just zombie
2014-02-27 10:55:45	jmpp_	just this: zombie kr onerror 
2014-02-27 10:55:48	twb	that
2014-02-27 10:55:57	twb	onerror means that successful programs are just closed
2014-02-27 10:56:05	jmpp_	and that causes screen to not output immediately if something fails?
2014-02-27 10:56:18	twb	Well try it
2014-02-27 10:56:26	twb	with ^A:screen true and ^A:screen false
2014-02-27 10:58:21	jmpp_	I'm just starting a new screen from scratch -c screenrc (where the zombie mode is now on), and feeding true(1) and false(1) to it
2014-02-27 10:58:31	jmpp_	but they both just exit without saying anything 
2014-02-27 10:58:40	jmpp_	just "screen is terminating"
2014-02-27 10:58:55	jmpp_	i.e.: screen -c screenrc true (screen is terminating)
2014-02-27 10:59:06	jmpp_	screen -c screenrc false (screen is terminating)
2014-02-27 11:03:52	jmpp_	how do I capture the output that screen outputs extremely briefly before starting down at the bottom?
2014-02-27 11:03:58	jmpp_	is impossible to read!
2014-02-27 11:05:10	jmpp_	Googling for "screen capture startup output" doesn't yield too many useful results
2014-02-27 11:08:12	 *	jmpp_ had to capture a screenshot right before screen flushes the output to be able to read it!
2014-02-27 11:15:27	twb	use script(1)
2014-02-27 11:16:26	jmpp_	OK, but there's seriously no built-in way to teel screen to hold that output just a little while longer until it can be read without flashing your eyes through the screen like Superman or Johnny Number 5?
2014-02-27 11:16:59	twb	Dunno
2014-02-27 11:17:30	jmpp_	seems like a serious limitation
2014-02-27 11:17:49	jmpp_	that output lasts so little it's next to useless
2014-02-27 11:18:36	twb	I don't know what output you are talking about
2014-02-27 11:18:42	twb	did you try script?
2014-02-27 11:19:12	jmpp_	OK, for instance, type some kind of mistake into your screenrc and start a fresh screen session
2014-02-27 11:19:32	jmpp_	screen will complain about the error in a small strip of text at the bottom
2014-02-27 11:19:48	jmpp_	that strip of text is a mere flash, disappears almost instantly
2014-02-27 11:19:53	jmpp_	and you can hardly catch what it's saying
2014-02-27 11:20:08	jmpp_	yes, I just tried with script, thanks for the ingenous suggestion! ;)
2014-02-27 11:20:26	jmpp_	however, it doesn't capture the screen informational text that I'm talking about, sadly
2014-02-27 11:20:53	twb	^AP?  Maybe that's only gamse
2014-02-27 11:21:01	jmpp_	gamse?
2014-02-27 11:21:03	twb	^Am shows last message
2014-02-27 11:21:05	twb	*games
2014-02-27 11:21:11	 *	jmpp_ tries
2014-02-27 11:21:41	 *	jmpp_ kisses twb and buys him a new house!
2014-02-27 11:21:51	jmpp_	thank you sooooo much!
2014-02-27 11:22:41	jmpp_	I don't have money to buy myself a house, but I'm gonna get you a new one just for teaching me about "last message"
2014-02-27 11:27:35	twb	Well you could start small
2014-02-27 11:27:43	twb	just buy some curtain rods or something
2014-02-27 11:27:48	twb	buy the rest of the house as you go
2014-02-27 11:28:35	ski	jmpp_ : `msgwait' and `msgminwait' defines how long Screen will show the messages, you can change the times. see the man page
2014-02-27 11:28:50	twb	ski: thanks :-)
2014-02-27 11:29:06	 *	jmpp_ buys ski an entire country
2014-02-27 11:29:23	 *	ski exchanges the country for a good book
2014-02-27 11:29:58	jmpp_	I like that. Not only because I adore reading, but also 'cause it's easier for my pocket ;)
2014-02-27 11:30:49	 *	ski idly ponders which books have the worth of a country
2014-02-27 11:31:51	jmpp_	damn! :P
2014-02-27 11:32:25	 *	jmpp_ blushes while revealing he once thought his grandparents had an original Gutemberg Bible hiding in their library
2014-02-27 11:34:06	jmpp_	I didn't know much about that Bible at the time, specifically the fact that there are only like three copies in the entire world, and this one not only was increbly realistic, but also had the word "Replica" pretty well hidden
2014-02-27 11:34:10	jmpp_	;)
2014-02-27 11:59:16	twb	ski: depends on the country
2014-02-27 11:59:40	ski	that was the point, yes :)
2014-02-27 11:59:40	twb	I wouldn't give you a brass nickel for .us, for example.
2014-02-27 12:01:32	jmpp_	is there any way to capture the screen "number"?
2014-02-27 12:01:44	jmpp_	don't recall if it's the tty what gets put into the socket path
2014-02-27 12:01:57	jmpp_	e.g.: 797.ttys004.mbpr(Attached)
2014-02-27 12:02:03	jmpp_	that's the ouput of sreen -ls
2014-02-27 12:02:10	jmpp_	from a plain screen invocation
2014-02-27 12:02:25	jmpp_	and I want to capture that number somehow
2014-02-27 12:03:13	ski	`797.ttys004.mbpr' is the session name
2014-02-27 12:03:55	jmpp_	right
2014-02-27 12:04:01	jmpp_	pid.tty.hostname
2014-02-27 12:04:18	jmpp_	is there any way to capture that in a script for a newly started screen session?
2014-02-27 12:04:23	ski	possibly you can programmatically query it with `-Q', in recent builds
2014-02-27 12:04:53	twb	jmpp_: just *set* a session name
2014-02-27 12:04:58	jmpp_	recent build's being...? I have 4.0.3 installed
2014-02-27 12:05:16	ski	`sessionname' without any arguments will display it
2014-02-27 12:05:17	jmpp_	4.00.03, actually
2014-02-27 12:05:21	twb	jmpp_: git
2014-02-27 12:05:27	twb	screen doesn't do releases anymore
2014-02-27 12:05:34	jmpp_	twb: looking into setting a session name
2014-02-27 12:05:38	jmpp_	how os?
2014-02-27 12:05:41	jmpp_	*so
2014-02-27 12:05:45	ski	`STY' in windows is set to the value of it (but isn't updated when you rename the session, naturally)
2014-02-27 12:05:49	jmpp_	did notice it hadn't been updated in a long while
2014-02-27 12:06:42	ski	jmpp_ : so i suppose it depends on *where* you want to get hold of the sesion name ..
2014-02-27 12:07:13	ski	if you're starting a Screen session, which is running some shell script in a shell (e.g.), then just check the value of `STY'
2014-02-27 12:09:28	jmpp_	it's for informational purposes for the person that will be executing the script, so I'm looking into using PID=$!
2014-02-27 12:10:15	jmpp_	why isn't screen doing releases anymore?
2014-02-27 12:42:15	jmpp_	ski: ${SCREEN} -U -S 'Console continous compilation' -D -m -c ${SCREENRC} ${GRUNT} --gruntfile ${GRUNTFILE} ${TARGET} &
2014-02-27 12:42:18	jmpp_	PID=$!
2014-02-27 12:42:21	jmpp_	that catches the PID
2014-02-27 12:43:01	jmpp_	if I use -d screen apparently double-forks, and the shell script manages to catch only the first PID, which is not the right one

2014-03-02 15:03:51	k_sze	On Debian Wheezy and Cygwin 64-bit, after Ctrl+A, Shift+A to start editing the title, I can do Ctrl+W to completely remove the title. But I can't do that on Mac OS X. Ctrl+W doesn't erase the title for me.

2014-03-02 19:28:17	k_sze	You can do C-w to erase words in the screen title in iTerm2?
2014-03-02 19:30:52	Gedge	I'm not on that OS at the moment.  Will try later.

2014-03-02 19:59:45	k_sze	And it also works in vim to erase words
2014-03-02 19:59:57	k_sze	maybe it's something with my .screenrc

2014-03-05 16:46:41	dive	this usually happens when I reattach it - the top screen is hidden

2014-03-06 20:43:15	ladyrassilon	I'm having a slight weird, repeatable, but unexplainable problem with screen
2014-03-06 20:44:28	ladyrassilon	I'm using ansible/vagrant to build a consistent dev environment for my company, and as a slightly showy finishing touch it starts the dev server running in a screen session so the frontend devs don't need to bother logging in and manually starting the process, but backend devs can log in and take control....
2014-03-06 20:45:11	ladyrassilon	however one of the systems despite being built from scratch ends up with an immediately dead screen (it doesn't log anything to screenlog)
2014-03-06 20:45:17	ladyrassilon	but running the command manually works fine
2014-03-06 20:51:06	ladyrassilon	Are there any other debugging steps I can be taking, OR something I'm missing?

2014-03-06 22:19:12	ski	ladyrassilon : i suppose you could attempt `defzombie kr' (or `zombie kr' which does the same thing), though i suspect this won't help
2014-03-06 22:19:58	ski	it might help if you say how you start Screen (what command line options, and what custom RC file, if any)
2014-03-06 22:38:52	ladyrassilon	I'm just running it as a shell example
2014-03-06 22:38:57	ladyrassilon	*shell command
2014-03-06 22:38:59	ladyrassilon	screen -L -d -m bash -c /home/vagrant/run_screen_server.sh
2014-03-06 22:39:26	ladyrassilon	- name: Screen server
2014-03-06 22:39:26	ladyrassilon	      shell: screen -d -m bash -c /home/vagrant/run_screen_server.sh
2014-03-06 22:39:37	ladyrassilon	in the ansible playbook
2014-03-06 22:41:48	ski	if you put `defzombie kr' (or `zombie kr' for older Screen version, i think) in `$HOME/.screenrc' (or maybe in `/etc/screenrc' ?), then in case the problem is that the shell process dies, Screen would now not terminate, allowing you to attach and attempt to diagnose the problem, and restart the script if necessary
2014-03-06 22:43:05	ski	if the problem is with Screen itself (or the environment it's starting it), doing this probably won't help
2014-03-06 22:43:09	ski	(btw, i assume `/home/vagrant/run_screen_server.sh' here doesn't start any new Screen process ?)
2014-03-06 22:43:48	ladyrassilon	no it just activates the venv and runs the server
2014-03-06 22:44:00	ladyrassilon	the weird thing is if I run that command from the shell, it works fine
2014-03-06 22:44:26	ski	"venv" ?
2014-03-06 22:44:35	ladyrassilon	python virtual environment
2014-03-06 22:45:20	ski	if you run the command from your shell, is that running as the same user as when started automatically by whatever thing is doing that above ?
2014-03-06 22:45:24	ladyrassilon	yup
2014-03-06 22:45:53	ski	what if you try the `defzombie' idea ?
2014-03-06 22:46:10	ski	(first make sure that you have a `defzombie' command in your Screen session, otherwise try `zombie')
2014-03-06 22:46:15	ladyrassilon	does there need to put anything else in the .screenrc? 
2014-03-06 22:46:20	ski	(s/Screen session/Screen version/)
2014-03-06 22:46:29	ski	ladyrassilon : probably not
2014-03-06 22:46:46	ski	if you already have something in there, just leave it in there as well
2014-03-06 22:47:32	ladyrassilon	there's nothing in there at the moment, just going to place it into the build script and try again
2014-03-06 22:47:39	ski	you can try `^A:defzombie' in a running Screen session to check whether it has the `defzombie' command
2014-03-06 22:48:47	ski	instead of using the per-user global `$HOME/.screenrc', you can use any `/path/to/file' you like, and add `-c /path/to/file' to the `screen' command line
2014-03-06 22:49:32	ski	(if you end up wanting to add stuff automatically as a part of a build process, that would probably be preferable)

2014-03-09 06:25:51	Celelibi	Hi there.
2014-03-09 06:26:07	Celelibi	screen does some strange character sequence conversion.
2014-03-09 06:28:06	Celelibi	When I press END, my terminal send ^[[OF and vim receive ^[[4~
2014-03-09 06:29:59	Celelibi	And I think there is something weird about the terminal handling. Some key combinations aren't interpreted the same way with and without screen.
2014-03-09 06:31:40	Celelibi	Like Shift+END. Screen doesn't modify the character sequence ^[[1;2F but vim interprets it differently whether it is inside a screen or not.
2014-03-09 06:31:51	Celelibi	And of course, it's correct only without screen.

2014-03-10 01:58:37	ski	Celelibi : `^[[4~' is the correct escape sequence for Screen to send, when receiving a keypress for `<end>'
2014-03-10 02:05:34	ski	(because that's what the manual for Screen says that it should send)
2014-03-10 02:09:03	ski	`*7' seems to be the proper termcap capability name for the keychord `<S-end>', `kEND' is the corresponding terminfo capability name for it
2014-03-10 02:12:16	ski	.. and `^[[1;2F' seems to be what Screen sends for `<S-end>' here
2014-03-10 02:14:22	ski	for some reason, the local terminfo DB here doesn't seem to record that for `screen' : `infocmp -T screen -x | grep kEND' lists nothing
2014-03-10 02:14:42	ski	(using `xterm' or e.g. `gnome' instead of `screen' in that command lists DB entries, though)
2014-03-10 02:15:55	ski	hm, no
2014-03-10 02:17:53	ski	`^[[1;2F' was what XTerm send to Screen, which apparently in this case passed it through. with Gnome-terminal outide Screen instead, i seem to get nothing at all
2014-03-10 02:23:08	ski	hm, looking at `term.c' in the source, it seems e.g `kH' (which seems to be corresponding to `<end>') is set to have escape sequence `\033[4~', which is the same as `[[4~'
2014-03-10 02:23:33	ski	but `*7' isn't mapped to any escape sequence at all
2014-03-10 02:23:51	Celelibi	So screen pass through any escape sequence it doesn't recognize. Is that sane?
2014-03-10 02:29:06	Celelibi	And the bug is that screen doesn't recognize ^[[1;2F as kEND. And even if it does, it can't generate a proper escape sequence because screen terminfo doesn't have a kEND entry.
2014-03-10 02:29:15	Celelibi	Am I right?
2014-03-10 02:31:25	Celelibi	I'd expect the screen terminal to be full-featured so that it can repeat any escape sequence it reads.
2014-03-10 02:32:14	ski	"So screen pass through any escape sequence it doesn't recognize." -- i'm not sure it does this
2014-03-10 02:33:55	ski	for "the screen terminal to be full-featured so that it can repeat any escape sequence it reads", Screen would have to support a common superset of all the key chording supported by every terminal whatsoever
2014-03-10 02:34:47	Celelibi	Yes.
2014-03-10 02:35:38	Celelibi	It's a bit of work, but it doesn't seems out of reach.
2014-03-10 02:36:00	Celelibi	Maybe even a simple program could generate it.

2014-03-11 02:15:03	Celelibi	How do I convert a terminfo name to a termcap name?
2014-03-11 02:19:49	ski	you could try looking it up in `man terminfo'
2014-03-11 02:33:53	Celelibi	Nice reference.
2014-03-11 02:33:56	Celelibi	I didn't know that.
2014-03-11 02:34:12	Celelibi	I'm discovering the termcap / terminfo things. :)
2014-03-11 02:35:00	Celelibi	But but... It still doesn't work. :(
2014-03-11 02:36:00	Celelibi	I've put this in my .screenrc:
2014-03-11 02:36:06	Celelibi	termcapinfo * *7=\E[1;2F
2014-03-11 02:37:26	Celelibi	Because that's what my terminal send for Shift+end.
2014-03-11 02:41:36	ski	that tells Screen that every terminal uses `\E[1;2F' for a `<S-end>'
2014-03-11 02:50:19	Celelibi	Ok. And how about the other end?
2014-03-11 02:50:46	Celelibi	How can vim know that \E[1;2F is <S-end>?
2014-03-11 02:51:11	Celelibi	I guess it performs itself a lookup in the terminfo database.
2014-03-11 02:51:21	ski	one can make custom changes to the terminfo DB
2014-03-11 02:51:42	ski	using `tic'
2014-03-11 02:52:32	ski	i'm not sure if the above would be sufficient to tell Screen what escape sequence to emit for `*7', to a process running in a Screen window
2014-03-11 02:56:42	Celelibi	Wait. Just to be sure to understand. That termcapinfo command tell screen that `\E[1;2F' is for `<S-end>' but screen still doesn't know how to generate a <S-end> to the application. Right?
2014-03-11 02:58:03	Celelibi	And I didn't really understand the last argument to termcapinfo.
2014-03-11 02:58:10	ski	i think it tells screen that if *any* terminal it is *running* sends `\E[1;2F', then that means the terminal was intending to send a `<S-end>' chord
2014-03-11 02:58:20	ski	(and i think that's false)
2014-03-11 02:58:55	ski	iiuc, the last argument is only of use with programs that use the termcap (not terminfo) `TERMCAP' environment variable
2014-03-11 02:59:22	Celelibi	Ok.
2014-03-11 02:59:26	ski	means you could have per-window tweaks, without having to change any central DB
2014-03-11 02:59:44	ski	at least i think so

2014-03-11 03:04:03	Celelibi	termcapinfo * @7=\E[1;2F
2014-03-11 03:04:37	Celelibi	It makes screen translate \E[1;2F into \E[4~
2014-03-11 03:04:51	Celelibi	Because @7 is for kend.
2014-03-11 03:16:07	Celelibi	ARG... dat coding style. It burn my eyes!
2014-03-11 03:17:23	ski	(you really should use something more specific than `*')
2014-03-11 03:47:25	Celelibi	Sure! I was just testing.
2014-03-11 03:48:52	Celelibi	And I won't lave that @7. I want and <S-end> to be sent, not a <end>.
2014-03-11 03:49:58	Celelibi	So I think I will just fix the terminfo.
2014-03-11 03:52:38	ski	you can add stuff to `$HOME/.terminfo/', by using `tic', and it'll get picked up by things looking at terminfo DB
2014-03-11 04:04:46	Celelibi	I guess I should take screeninfo.src and customize it and then feed it to tic.

2014-03-11 04:54:19	Celelibi	Ok.
2014-03-11 04:54:41	ski	hm, actually

2014-03-11 04:55:18	ski	so i was probably comfusing with `kBEG3',`kBEG4' and so on
2014-03-11 04:55:58	Celelibi	I'm not sure what a "begin" key is supposed to do.
2014-03-11 04:56:21	ski	the terminfo entry installed for XTerm here has entries for stuff like `kEND3',`kEND4',`kEND5',`kEND6',`kEND7',`kLFT3',&c.
2014-03-11 04:56:57	Celelibi	So let's map this to kBEG, it seems nice. :)
2014-03-11 04:58:07	Celelibi	Would tic tell me if there is a conflict between espace sequence?
2014-03-11 04:59:27	Celelibi	It doesn't.
2014-03-11 05:03:35	ski	<http://porneia.free.fr/larswm/larswm-doc-7.0/a490.html> e.g. mentions the key event `KP_Begin' in X
2014-03-11 05:03:57	ski	i suspect some earlier keyboards used `<begin>' and `<end>' more or less in a pair
2014-03-11 05:05:19	Celelibi	Now it's <home> that goes in pair with <end>.
2014-03-11 05:05:24	ski	yes
2014-03-11 05:05:53	ski	anyway, one could also set `kBEG3',...`kBEG7' for `xterm', since it sends appropriate escape sequences for those
2014-03-11 05:11:41	ski	        kcuu1=\EOA, kUP=\E[1;2A, kUP3=\E[1;3A, kUP4=\E[1;4A,
2014-03-11 05:11:43	ski	        kUP5=\E[1;5A, kUP6=\E[1;6A, kUP7=\E[1;7A
2014-03-11 05:13:17	ski	that's respectively for `<up>',`<S-up>',`<M-up>',`<M-S-up>',`<C-up>',`<C-S-up>',`<C-M-up>',`<C-M-S-up>'
2014-03-11 05:14:15	ski	`<C-M-S-up>' sends `\E[1;8A' in XTerm, so it would probably make sense to add `kUP8=\E[1;8A' -- for some reason this isn't in the existing XTerm terminfo DB entry, though
2014-03-11 05:16:39	ski	another thing which i've noticed, which i wonder if it's a bug, or by design : `@7'/`kend' is "end key" according to `man terminfo'. still in Screen docs (and functionality), `kH'/`kll' is "End" (in `man terminfo' this is called "lower-left key (home down)")

2014-03-11 08:14:15	Celelibi	My last bug was because I left a termcapinfo command in my screenrc.
2014-03-11 08:14:21	 *	Celelibi go hang himself
2014-03-11 08:18:41	Celelibi	There is something I don't understand with terminals.
2014-03-11 08:19:20	Celelibi	In the end, everybody agreed with a common language to describe the escape sequence and their meaning.
2014-03-11 08:20:14	Celelibi	The terminfo language.
2014-03-11 08:21:00	Celelibi	So why bother with a double string conversion?
2014-03-11 08:22:23	Celelibi	On one side there is the terminal thinking "I want to send <S-end> let's lookup what string I should send" and on the application side "I received an escape string, better lookup what the terminal meant".
2014-03-11 08:24:01	Celelibi	I have an idea of why it has been done that way. Probably because real terminals just send their preconfigured escape sequence and hope for the best on the other side.
2014-03-11 08:24:55	Celelibi	But virtual terminals could probable avoid this.
2014-03-11 08:30:03	Celelibi	(However, it's fun how typing Esc+O+F fast enough is equivalent to a "end". :))

2014-03-11 08:35:38	ski	Celelibi : "I want to send <S-end> let's lookup what string I should send" doesn't happen (afaik)
2014-03-11 08:35:57	Celelibi	It depends on the terminal, I think.
2014-03-11 08:36:01	ski	simply different terminals have decided to send different escape sequences
2014-03-11 08:36:21	Celelibi	isn't xterm thoroughtly configurable about that?
2014-03-11 08:36:25	ski	the termcap/terminfo DB merely *describe* (hopefully correctly) the choices made

2014-03-11 09:25:14	Celelibi	There is something weird (again).
2014-03-11 09:26:12	Celelibi	Out of screen (in xterm): infocmp -x1 | grep '\[5;2~'
2014-03-11 09:26:13	Celelibi	        kPRV=\E[5;2~,
2014-03-11 09:26:40	Celelibi	In screen: infocmp -x1 | grep '\[5;2~'
2014-03-11 09:26:40	Celelibi	        kPRV=\E[5;2~,
2014-03-11 09:26:55	Celelibi	It's the exact same, right?
2014-03-11 09:27:42	tinyzygote	hey i added a printf() line to bashrc to deal with detecting the running process for screen, in some instances now if i use ^r or any history the insertion point  gets mucked up so it'll show me 1/2 of a command but i can't backspace, ^l doesn't fix it, but calling reset does
2014-03-11 09:28:28	Celelibi	Then why does vim act correctly when it recieve that escape sequence from xterm and does nothing when it's from screen?
2014-03-11 09:34:59	twb	Probably because vim's behaviour is hardcoded based on $TERM
2014-03-11 09:35:11	twb	Test if "TERM=xterm vim foo" has the issue inside scren
2014-03-11 09:40:38	Celelibi	twb: that means nothing. TERM env variable is also used to access the right terminfo.
2014-03-11 09:40:43	Celelibi	I think.
2014-03-11 09:40:57	Celelibi	But yes, it works with TERM=xterm.
2014-03-11 09:41:32	twb	Yeah I know Emacs also has additional code that triggers if and only if TERM is xterm*
2014-03-11 09:41:39	twb	Even though it can be valid elsewhere
2014-03-11 09:42:16	Celelibi	Ok, let's try to rename xterm terminfo into screen.
2014-03-11 09:42:22	twb	Your case is unusual that both terminfo entries have the thing you care about -- usually these questions are about some feature xterm has, that's not queryable in terminfo
2014-03-11 09:42:42	Celelibi	I just added it in the screen terminfo.
2014-03-11 09:42:55	Celelibi	It worked for a few keys. But not this one.
2014-03-11 09:43:18	twb	Mm, I was doing that with tic(1) long ago, I don't really remember the details
2014-03-11 09:43:29	Celelibi	I did it with tic. :)
2014-03-11 09:44:41	twb	I think I was just doing it to provide screen-256colors on hosts that predated that
2014-03-11 09:45:03	twb	Ah, found my notes -- http://cyber.com.au/~twb/doc/term256.txt

2014-03-11 09:51:01	Celelibi	I think you're right twb.
2014-03-11 09:51:27	Celelibi	I tried swapping the terminfo of xterm and screen.
2014-03-11 09:51:46	Celelibi	And the behavior is not linked to the terminfo.
2014-03-11 09:52:01	Celelibi	It's more linked to the TERM env itself. :(
2014-03-11 09:52:11	ski	yes, this is Vim being a bad program
2014-03-11 09:52:23	twb	+1
2014-03-11 09:52:28	Celelibi	That's sad. :(
2014-03-11 09:53:24	ski	(as a workaround, undoubtely, to be able to access features either not standardized in termcap/terminfo, or at least one which currently aren't described in there, even though it would be possible to do so)

2014-03-11 09:55:21	Celelibi	Isn't your sentence incomplete?
2014-03-11 09:55:31	Celelibi	What "as a workaround"?
2014-03-11 09:55:42	ski	it's a continuation of the eariler part
2014-03-11 09:55:59	 *	ski recalls looking briefly at the particular code of Vim in question, responsible for this
2014-03-11 09:56:01	Celelibi	As a workaround I could define a "map" in vim.
2014-03-11 09:57:35	ski	Celelibi : anyway, if you look at twb's notes, you can see that you can use `use=screen' at the end, to not have to repeat most of the entries. only mentioning the ones you want to add or change
2014-03-11 09:57:58	twb	Yeppers
2014-03-11 09:58:36	Celelibi	Yes but since I have no idea of the behavior in case of conflict...
2014-03-11 09:58:51	ski	(one can also use several such `use=...' parts, if one wants to specify the "patch" as a separate file, e.g.)
2014-03-11 09:58:57	twb	Celelibi: ask #vim
2014-03-11 09:59:17	ski	iirc if you place it last, the stuff before will override it
2014-03-11 10:01:20	Celelibi	Ok, so early definitions takes precedence.
2014-03-11 10:02:30	twb	ski: you aren't the unicycle guy, are you?  I think I get you and him mixed up.
2014-03-11 10:02:30	ski	you can use `-c' with `tic' to check whether your file(s) are correct or not, without generating any output file
2014-03-11 10:02:30	ski	twb : i suspect you mean shapr ?
2014-03-11 10:02:31	twb	Ah sounds right
2014-03-11 10:02:31	twb	He had, like, a mountain unicycle with gears and shit
2014-03-11 10:04:00	ski	  When a `use=entry-name' field is discovered in a terminal entry currently being compiled, `tic' reads in the binary from `/usr/share/terminfo' to complete the entry.  (Entries created from file will be used first.  If the environment variable `TERMINFO' is set, that directory is searched instead of `/usr/share/terminfo'.)
2014-03-11 10:04:08	ski	  `tic' duplicates the capabilities in `entry-name' for the current entry, with the exception of those capabilities that explicitly are defined in the current entry.
2014-03-11 10:04:16	ski	  When an entry, e.g., `entry_name_1', contains a `use=entry_name_2' field, any canceled capabilities in `entry_name_2' must also appear in `entry_name_1' before `use=' for these capabilities to be canceled in `entry_name_1'.
2014-03-11 10:04:21	ski	  If the environment variable `TERMINFO' is set, the compiled results are placed there instead of `/usr/share/terminfo'.

2014-03-12 04:04:11	Celelibi	I guess that it use xterm's terminfo to understand the escape sequences it receive from the terminal, and use its own terminfo to produce the escape sequence for the same feature.

2014-03-12 04:11:51	Celelibi	So now my question is: how come xterm and screen don't produce the same sequence for "end"?
2014-03-12 04:11:58	Celelibi	There is a translation at some point.
2014-03-12 04:14:20	ski	they have decided differently for some reason
2014-03-12 04:16:15	Celelibi	You mean the translation is harcoded?

2014-03-12 04:17:44	ski	yes, more or less
2014-03-12 04:18:01	ski	termcap/terminfo is meant to abstract over such differences
2014-03-12 04:20:02	Celelibi	Sure, but that means I can't make kPRV to produce another escape sequence.
2014-03-12 04:23:55	-->	brainwash (~brainwash@unaffiliated/brainwash) has joined #screen
2014-03-12 04:24:10	Celelibi	And I can't make screen easily support new escape sequence.
2014-03-12 04:24:45	Celelibi	If screen has so idea what kPRV is and how to generate it, it just pass it through to the application.
2014-03-12 04:25:58	Celelibi	and if gnome-terminal has a different escape sequence for kPRV, the application (like vim) can't rely on the screen terminfo to understand it.
2014-03-12 04:28:04	ski	Celelibi : hm, i just recalled. i think it actually sends escape sequences to the process running in the Screen window, depending its `bindkey' tables
2014-03-12 04:28:13	ski	Celelibi : try `^A:bindkey -d', e.g.
2014-03-12 04:28:45	ski	however, that only works for key capabilities that have termcap names that Screen knows about
2014-03-12 04:29:07	Celelibi	I can add the termcaps.
2014-03-12 04:29:30	Celelibi	Oh "that screen knows about".

2014-03-12 04:31:58	ski	right, doing `^A:bindkey -k %e other' here makes `<S-previous>' run the `other' command
2014-03-12 04:32:09	ski	so to send whatever escape sequence you want, use `stuff' instead
2014-03-12 04:32:21	ski	(`%e' is the termcap name for the terminfo `kPRV')
2014-03-12 04:32:24	Celelibi	By default %e has no key binded.
2014-03-12 04:32:31	ski	right, but you can add it
2014-03-12 04:33:29	ski	(i didn't recall the above before since there was some time ago i last played around with this)
2014-03-12 04:33:52	Celelibi	Nice. I can make <S-PageUp> send "foo". :)
2014-03-12 04:34:41	ski	(also, i haven't tried to use it to make it send more escape sequence. i tested binding `<S-left>' and `<S-right>' to cycle through windows, or regions)
2014-03-12 04:35:53	ski	so, what (i think) happens is that Screen receives an escape sequences from the terminal it's running inside
2014-03-12 04:35:55	Celelibi	Ok so, the key binding mechanism is the sending lookup table and $TERM's terminfo is the reading lookup table.
2014-03-12 04:36:18	ski	looking up `TERM' in termcap or terminfo, it maps that escape sequence backwards, in this case to `%e'
2014-03-12 04:36:54	ski	then it sends the `%e' key capability to the window, using its `bindkey' tables
2014-03-12 04:37:27	Celelibi	Yep, I see.
2014-03-12 04:37:31	ski	(or more generally, performing any command you've told it to, when receiving an escape sequence mapping back to `%e' for the terminal in question attached to Screen)
2014-03-12 04:37:58	ski	also note that you can have the same Screen session attached to multiple terminal displays, possibly of different terminal types
2014-03-12 04:38:38	ski	so depending on in which terminal the escape sequence is sent from (which is identified by checking `TERM'), different translations to termcap keycap names will have to be applied
2014-03-12 04:39:33	ski	(and Screen handles this for you. i'm just mentioning it, to hopefully get a better idea of what Screen is doing)
2014-03-12 04:41:09	Celelibi	But still, I don't think the bindkey system should be used this way. I should be able to state `bindkey -t foo stuff foo<kPRV>bar' and then a second translation convert <kPRV> into the right escape sequence regarding Screen's terminfo.

2014-03-12 04:49:05	Celelibi	How do I put the escape char into the bindkey?

2014-03-12 04:49:57	Celelibi	Oh, yes, it worked with ^[

2014-03-12 22:54:24	ski	(and use `-S' as mentioned above, if you have more than one session)
2014-03-12 22:54:24	mintux	second screen is screen name?
2014-03-12 22:54:44	ski	the part after `-X' is the Screen command name, which in this case is `screen' (for "create new screen window")
2014-03-12 22:55:03	mintux	i have this detached screen 	31468.yyyy
2014-03-12 22:55:10	ski	ok, so e.g.
2014-03-12 22:55:11	mintux	now i want to make a window inside it
2014-03-12 22:55:18	mintux	and run a command 
2014-03-12 22:55:22	ski	  screen -S 31468.yyyy -X screen
2014-03-12 22:55:44	ski	(or you can omit the process number part, `31468.', if you have no other session matching the `yyyy' part)
2014-03-12 22:55:47	mintux	wow
2014-03-12 22:56:08	ski	if you wanted to create a new screen window running say emacs, instead of a shell, you could do
2014-03-12 22:56:12	ski	  screen -S 31468.yyyy -X screen emacs -nw
2014-03-12 22:56:25	ski	(`-nw' here being a command-line option to Emacs)
2014-03-12 22:56:53	mintux	yes i know
2014-03-12 22:56:57	mintux	it worked
2014-03-12 22:57:06	ski	if you're currently inside the Screen session (or really, if `STY' is set), you can abbreviate these two last commands as simply
2014-03-12 22:57:09	ski	and
2014-03-12 22:57:11	ski	  screen
2014-03-12 22:57:12	ski	  screen emacs -nw
2014-03-12 22:57:26	ski	(the `-S' and `-X' parts are then implicit)
2014-03-12 22:57:53	mintux	ski: so another question i run two command in two window inside one session . is it possible to find out the processes is end? 
2014-03-12 22:58:40	ski	.. you could check it manually, of course
2014-03-12 22:58:58	mintux	or i should make a file and consider that file if it exists then that process is finished  
2014-03-12 22:59:25	ski	you can use the `-t' option to set a title to your screen window
2014-03-12 22:59:46	mintux	ski: can i get list of window outside screen ?
2014-03-12 23:00:05	ski	  screen -S 31468.yyyy -X screen -t editing emacs -nw
2014-03-12 23:00:06	ski	or
2014-03-12 23:00:06	mintux	detached screen i mean
2014-03-12 23:00:13	ski	  screen -t editing emacs -nw
2014-03-12 23:00:18	ski	(if inside the session)
2014-03-12 23:00:19	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:01:16	ski	i think in recent builds, there's a `-Q' option you can use to query output from some Screen commands programmatically, rather than only interactively inspecting the resulting info
2014-03-12 23:01:22	mintux	now i have another question how can i access to screen list of another user for example when i run screen in my command line in said 1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-mrg.  actually my path is /var/run/screen/S-mrg. but i want to access to this path screen /var/run/screen/S-www-data.
2014-03-12 23:01:32	ski	probably that could be used to get a list of windows, from outside
2014-03-12 23:01:40	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:02:01	ski	there's also a `-p' option you can use to preselect a window number or title, if you want to invoke some Screen command on that Screen window
2014-03-12 23:02:20	mintux	cool
2014-03-12 23:02:27	ski	e.g. if you want to use the `stuff' Screen command to send some text to the process running in the window, as if the user had typed the text manually into it
2014-03-12 23:03:00	ski	mintux : well, you could use a multi-user Screen session
2014-03-12 23:03:16	mintux	ski: and how
2014-03-12 23:03:51	ski	your Screen executable needs to have the set-uid bit set for this to work (at least when you create the Screen session. i don't think it is actually needed when you just want to attach to it)
2014-03-12 23:04:07	ski	then you need to invoke the Screen command `multiuser on'
2014-03-12 23:04:28	mintux	i try it now
2014-03-12 23:04:32	ski	and finally, you need to add permissions for the other user to view, and possibly change, the session
2014-03-12 23:04:53	mintux	ski where should i put multiuser on ?
2014-03-12 23:05:02	mintux	$ screen multiuser on
2014-03-12 23:05:14	ski	either you can do it manually, by `^A:multiuser on'
2014-03-12 23:05:31	mintux	ski: no i want do it with command 
2014-03-12 23:06:04	ski	or you can put it in `$HOME/.screenrc' (which is read when Screen starts a session), or you can use another `/path/to/my_screenrc_file', and then use `-c /path/to/my_screenrc_file' when creating the Screen session
2014-03-12 23:06:08	mintux	ski: actually i want run screen from php then it stored in  /var/run/screen/S-www-data.
2014-03-12 23:06:24	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:07:06	mintux	but i want to access root user to screen created by php
2014-03-12 23:07:12	ski	to add all permissions for the user `mrg' to the session, you can do `acladd mrg' (one can also supply a password here, see the man page)
2014-03-12 23:07:30	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:07:39	ski	to only allow read-only access, instad of that `acladd', use
2014-03-12 23:08:21	mintux	all the commands should be run inside screen ? when i invoke screen from php i put -d option to detached 
2014-03-12 23:08:43	mintux	so how can i set that access ?
2014-03-12 23:08:53	ski	  aclchg mrg -w "#"
2014-03-12 23:09:01	mintux	actually it's www-data user
2014-03-12 23:09:06	ski	(but see the docs on `aclchg' for details)
2014-03-12 23:09:36	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:10:04	ski	(btw, if you run `screen multiuser on' from a shell inside the session, it will interpret `multiuser on' as an OS command (implicitly using the `screen' Screen command to make a new window))
2014-03-12 23:11:05	ski	mintux : i suppose you have something like
2014-03-12 23:11:25	ski	  screen -d -S my_session_name
2014-03-12 23:11:26	ski	?
2014-03-12 23:11:36	ski	so you can say
2014-03-12 23:11:44	ski	  screen -c /path/to/my_screenrc_file -d -S my_session_name
2014-03-12 23:12:00	mintux	ski: screen -dmS youtube bash -c "exec ./1.sh"
2014-03-12 23:12:05	ski	where `/path/to/my_screenrc_file' contains Screen commands which the session should start with
2014-03-12 23:12:28	ski	then the rc-file can create windows with processes, &c.
2014-03-12 23:12:35	mintux	but without exec
2014-03-12 23:13:12	ski	i'm not sure what your `./1.sh' script does
2014-03-12 23:13:37	mintux	yes it worked 
2014-03-12 23:13:39	mintux	-c
2014-03-12 23:13:47	mintux	$ screen -c /var/run/screen/S-www-data. -ls
2014-03-12 23:14:31	ski	you can place commands like `screen -t some_title some_command args ...', `chdir some_dir' into the rc-file
2014-03-12 23:14:48	ski	why `-ls' there ?
2014-03-12 23:15:02	mintux	i was wrong 
2014-03-12 23:15:18	mintux	i put same name session in both php and my user 
2014-03-12 23:15:24	mintux	i thought it's that
2014-03-12 23:16:16	ski	also, it might be helpful to add the `defzombie kr' command (or `zombie kr' if your Screen version doesn't have `defzombie' yet), to make windows stick around after processes have terminated -- so if anything goes wrong, you can manually attach, and see whether there was any error messages, and possibly restart the process with `r' or kill the window with `k'
2014-03-12 23:17:26	ski	if you want a multi-user session, you should probably place `multiuser on' into your rc-file, and also the `acladd' or `aclchg' command to selectively allow other users to attach (and, i think, to also send command remotely)
2014-03-12 23:17:59	mintux	ski: see this  http://axgig.com/images/72172587384663913166.jpg
2014-03-12 23:18:28	mintux	ski:  now i want to detached this screen session in mrg user so as you said i tried mrg@mrg-samsung ~ $ screen -c /var/run/screen/S-www-data. -d -S 1048.yyyy
2014-03-12 23:18:41	mintux	but it said There is no screen to be detached matching 1048.yyyy.
2014-03-12 23:19:16	ski	let's say you've added user `mrg' or `root' using `acladd' or `aclchg', and now that user wants to attach to the session run under user `www-data', then they can say
2014-03-12 23:19:37	ski	  screen -r www-data/my_session_name
2014-03-12 23:19:38	ski	or just
2014-03-12 23:19:40	ski	  screen -r www-data/
2014-03-12 23:19:47	mintux	ski: i cant do run acladd for www-data
2014-03-12 23:19:50	ski	if there's just one multi-user session under that user
2014-03-12 23:20:08	ski	mintux : why not ?
2014-03-12 23:20:18	mintux	www-data is a user made with Apache2 and doesn't has shell 
2014-03-12 23:20:30	ski	i don't think it matters
2014-03-12 23:20:46	mintux	so where should i put rc file for www-data
2014-03-12 23:20:58	ski	wherever you like
2014-03-12 23:21:05	-->	diniwed (~gavron@ool-44c537b4.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #screen
2014-03-12 23:21:12	mintux	ski: screen where looking for it?
2014-03-12 23:21:52	ski	either in their home directory, as `.screenrc', or `/some/place/else/my_www-data_screenrc_file', but then you have to use `-c /some/place/else/my_www-data_screenrc_file' when starting the session as user `www-data'
2014-03-12 23:22:09	mintux	got it
2014-03-12 23:22:33	mintux	just put multiuser on inside it?
2014-03-12 23:22:35	ski	screen is looking at `$HOME/.screenrc' (and also as `/etc/screenrc' for a system-wide rc-file which is read first)
2014-03-12 23:23:03	ski	and also an `acladd ...' or `aclchg ...' command, for the user who wants to attach
2014-03-12 23:23:25	ski	and possibly also some `screen ...' commands to open some windows with processes in them at Screen startup
2014-03-12 23:23:37	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:23:43	ski	maybe using `chdir ...' inbetween to give them different starting current working directories
2014-03-12 23:24:16	mintux	i put this
2014-03-12 23:24:18	mintux	multiuser on
2014-03-12 23:24:18	mintux	acladd mrg
2014-03-12 23:25:37	ski	what's the output of the
2014-03-12 23:25:39	ski	  ls -Fl `which screen`
2014-03-12 23:25:42	ski	shell command ?
2014-03-12 23:25:52	mintux	-rwxr-sr-x 1 root utmp 376056 Oct  8  2012 /usr/bin/screen
2014-03-12 23:26:10	ski	ok, so you have set-gid, but not set-uid
2014-03-12 23:26:30	mintux	ski: i run this with www-data: screen -dmS yyyy bash -c  "./1.sh" -c  /home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting
2014-03-12 23:26:53	mintux	so i should have access from mrg user
2014-03-12 23:27:03	ski	you need
2014-03-12 23:27:04	ski	  chmod u+s `which screen`
2014-03-12 23:27:17	ski	to set the set-uid bit. this has to be done as a super-user
2014-03-12 23:27:32	mintux	ok
2014-03-12 23:27:42	mintux	Done
2014-03-12 23:27:54	ski	also note that there's some security risk in this, if there's a bug in Screen, and someone finds out how to exploit it, they could use this to get root access
2014-03-12 23:28:10	mintux	$ screen -ls
2014-03-12 23:28:10	mintux	Directory '/var/run/screen' must have mode 755.
2014-03-12 23:28:24	ski	yes, so you'll need to change that as well
2014-03-12 23:28:46	ski	you could first check
2014-03-12 23:28:52	mintux	:-D
2014-03-12 23:28:54	ski	  ls -Fld /var/run/screen
2014-03-12 23:28:57	mintux	it broke 
2014-03-12 23:29:10	ski	to see what it was originally, if you want to change back

2014-03-12 23:29:12	ski	then you can do
2014-03-12 23:29:14	ski	  chmod 755 /var/run/screen
2014-03-12 23:29:18	ski	to change it
2014-03-12 23:29:24	mintux	i did chmod 755 /var/run/screen
2014-03-12 23:29:26	ski	ok, `rwxrwxr-x' is `775'
2014-03-12 23:30:48	mintux	ski: a question ?
2014-03-12 23:30:52	ski	aye ?
2014-03-12 23:31:03	mintux	if i add mrg to www-group
2014-03-12 23:31:15	ski	btw, i'm not sure, but i think
2014-03-12 23:31:17	mintux	then i can access to /var/run/screen/S-www-data ?
2014-03-12 23:31:20	ski	  screen -dmS yyyy bash -c  "./1.sh" -c  /home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting
2014-03-12 23:31:23	ski	should be

2014-03-12 23:31:48	ski	otherwise i think the `-c /home/...' will be sent to Bash, rather than to Screen
2014-03-12 23:32:07	ski	also, instead of running `bash -c "./1.sh"' there, why not instead add
2014-03-12 23:32:14	mintux	so i make a home folder for www-data manually

2014-03-12 23:39:55	ski	the `Private' probably means the `multiuser on' didn't take effect, because the set-uid bit wasn't set when the session was created
2014-03-12 23:40:03	ski	so end the session, and make a new one
2014-03-12 23:40:24	mintux	hmm
2014-03-12 23:40:29	mintux	one more thing
2014-03-12 23:40:37	mintux	i think it's enough to know what is 
2014-03-12 23:40:45	mintux	the session id
2014-03-12 23:40:51	mintux	and i can check it by
2014-03-12 23:41:02	mintux	# ls /var/run/screen/S-www-data
2014-03-12 23:41:10	mintux	and i run this command:
2014-03-12 23:41:25	mintux	screen -dmS youtube bash -c "exec ./1.sh"
2014-03-12 23:41:31	mintux	so after finished 1.sh
2014-03-12 23:41:38	mintux	the screen terminated
2014-03-12 23:41:49	mintux	and there is nothing in # ls /var/run/screen/S-www-data output
2014-03-12 23:41:57	mintux	i just know this process is finish or not
2014-03-12 23:42:06	ski	i think you can say `screen -ls www-data/' to list multi-user (iow, non-private) sessions of that user
2014-03-12 23:42:37	ski	(which i think is nicer than relying on the `ls /var/run/screen/S-www-data' one)
2014-03-12 23:42:53	mintux	$ screen -ls www-data/
2014-03-12 23:42:53	mintux	There is a screen on:
2014-03-12 23:42:53	mintux		1858.yyyy	(03/12/2014 07:04:17 PM)	(Private)
2014-03-12 23:42:53	mintux	1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-www-data.
2014-03-12 23:43:22	ski	"so after finished 1.sh","the screen terminated" -- yes, because there was no other window left in the session, and because you didn't put `defzombie kr' in the rc-file
2014-03-12 23:43:23	mintux	i think i bother you 
2014-03-12 23:43:48	mintux	i search and google it to see how to add multiuser

2014-03-12 23:44:01	ski	(and if you have any Screen `screen' commands in the rc-file, you should place the `defzombie' command before them, otherwise it might not take effect)
2014-03-12 23:44:06	mintux	and if i could not success then tell you
2014-03-12 23:44:06	ski	mintux : no, you don't bother me at all
2014-03-12 23:44:47	mintux	ski thanks i try it my self and report back
2014-03-12 23:45:09	ski	<mintux> and i run this command:
2014-03-12 23:45:14	ski	<mintux> screen -dmS youtube bash -c "exec ./1.sh"
2014-03-12 23:45:26	ski	you forgot the `-c /home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting' part
2014-03-12 23:45:47	ski	also, i think you don't need to put `-c "exec ./1.sh"' in the original invocation (unless you want to)
2014-03-12 23:45:59	ski	if it's the same every time, it's probably nicer to say something like
2014-03-12 23:46:09	ski	  screen -t some_title_you_like bash -c "./1.sh"
2014-03-12 23:46:16	ski	near the end of `/home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting'

2014-03-12 23:46:42	mintux	ski: i want
2014-03-12 23:46:58	mintux	ski: to run command from php script like this:

2014-03-12 23:47:24	mintux	it's the command i run inside php file
2014-03-12 23:47:34	mintux	so i have to use -c "1.sh"
2014-03-12 23:47:41	ski	mintux : when you first joined #screen, you waited only ~ 16 minutes after asking your question, before leaving the channel -- this is *far* to short a time to wait, for a slow and quiet, technical, channel like #screen
2014-03-12 23:48:23	mintux	now i was googleing 
2014-03-12 23:48:36	ski	mintux : you should have waited preferably at least a few hours. waiting a day, or a few days (or otherwise coming back later days, staying at least a cople of hours, to check)
2014-03-12 23:48:59	mintux	ski: the problem is i cant run screen from www-data and go inside it and run that command to add mrg user
2014-03-12 23:49:18	mintux	maybe
2014-03-12 23:49:21	mintux	add a shell 
2014-03-12 23:49:27	ski	mintux : i already said that you could place then *Screen* `-c ...' option *before* the `bash -c ...' part for *Bash* :)

2014-03-12 23:49:56	mintux	ski: i did it didn't work
2014-03-12 23:50:15	ski	or even better, if you place the `screen bash -c "./1.sh"' command in `/home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting' :

2014-03-12 23:50:44	ski	why ?
2014-03-12 23:51:43	mintux	ski: because may be some steps i don't do correctly or i don't get completely what you said

2014-03-12 23:51:58	ski	can the user `www-data' read the file `/home/mrg/www/Test/Script/PHP/youtube/setting' ?
2014-03-12 23:52:26	mintux	ski: how can i know it can read it or not ?
2014-03-12 23:52:27	ski	if it can't then you need to use some other file or file location, or change permissions so that `www-data' can read the file

2014-03-12 23:54:19	mintux	so i put inside /etc/apache folder
2014-03-12 23:54:23	ski	or an `x' in the middle part, if `www-data' is part of the same group as those directories
2014-03-12 23:54:36	ski	that could probably be better
2014-03-12 23:54:51	ski	or maybe make a directory for `www-data' somewhere
2014-03-12 23:55:01	mintux	done

2014-03-13 00:04:05	mintux	the problem was both -c 
2014-03-13 00:04:22	ski	ok
2014-03-13 00:04:59	ski	mintux : did you add the `defzombie kr' to your rc-file ?
2014-03-13 00:05:43	mintux	no i put it now what is that ?
2014-03-13 00:07:06	ski	it will prevent Screen windows containing dead processes from disappearing
2014-03-13 00:07:28	ski	so if your `bash -c "./1.sh"' script dies, the Screen session won't terminate
2014-03-13 00:07:51	ski	so you can manually attach, and check what the error message was, and then either use `r' to restart the process, or `k' to kill the window
2014-03-13 00:07:51	mintux	ah
2014-03-13 00:08:30	ski	also, please try, in an attached Screen session, the following : `^A:defzombie'
2014-03-13 00:08:54	ski	if it replies "unknown command 'defzombie'", then you need to use `zombie' instead of `defzombie'
2014-03-13 00:09:25	mintux	Ok i will do that

2014-03-13 01:48:50	shakar	Hi all. I'm experiencing some behavior with the Fkeys that I don't want and that is conflicting with regular usage of my terminal emulator. .screenrc: http://pastebin.com/irHjnki0 . When using htop, pressing F2 or F3 results in the message "This window is already logged out". Pressing F6 toggles copy mode. Pressing F9 seems to toggle copy mode twice in a row. This is strange, because this didn't happen before, and I've never configured anything in screen 
2014-03-13 01:48:51	shakar	regarding the F keys. Can anyone shed some light for me? thanks for any help!
2014-03-13 02:04:25	-->	yaymukund (~yaymukund@cpe-74-71-5-72.nyc.res.rr.com) has joined #screen
2014-03-13 02:04:34	yaymukund	As part of my shell, I'm using fletcherm's prompt: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/fletcherm.zsh-theme Do you know why loading `zsh` in screen would break that? http://i.imgur.com/T5cV4c4.png
2014-03-13 02:05:44	ski	shakar : i'm not sure `escape \033\033' is a very good idea ..
2014-03-13 02:06:12	yaymukund	it works as expected when I'm not in a screen session: http://i.imgur.com/IJY7EKs.png
2014-03-13 02:07:38	shakar	ski: why's that?
2014-03-13 02:07:39	ski	yaymukund : perhaps you need to start your screen session using `-U' ?
2014-03-13 02:08:13	yaymukund	wow, ski, thank you so much. That worked.
2014-03-13 02:08:52	yaymukund	ah, UTF-8 mode. That makes perfect sense
2014-03-13 02:08:55	ski	shakar : commonly terminals translates keys like the `F<num>'-keys, and also stuff like `<Meta>-w',`<up>',`<Ctrl>-up' and so on to escape sequences starting with `\033'
2014-03-13 02:09:16	ski	yaymukund : did it work for an existing session, or did you have to make a new one ?
2014-03-13 02:09:37	yaymukund	I made a new one, closed the old one
2014-03-13 02:10:19	ski	ok, for old one, i think `^A:utf8 on on' would help
2014-03-13 02:10:49	ski	instead of saying `-U' each time, i think you can probably place `defutf8 on' in your `$HOME/.screenrc' (or `/etc/screenrc')
2014-03-13 02:11:01	shakar	ski: ok, I'll try to use something else. Is there a way to hit a key/key-combo and see the code (like '\033') that .screenrc would use for it?
2014-03-13 02:11:35	ski	shakar : yes, but if possible, it's best to avoid that, since different terminals may use different escape sequences
2014-03-13 02:12:10	ski	(so if you do that, and then attach to the same Screen session from another kind of terminal, perhaps from another machine, via SSH, things may break)
2014-03-13 02:12:40	yaymukund	ski: that's in my normal screenrc, but here I'm usinmg a custom screenrc that sources my original screenrc. For some reason, it didn't inherit the `defutf8 on` property.
2014-03-13 02:12:41	ski	is there any particular key/key-combo you had in mind ?
2014-03-13 02:12:59	ski	yaymukund : strange
2014-03-13 02:13:24	ski	(did it find the original one at all ? or were there some not-found error ?)
2014-03-13 02:14:00	shakar	Well I'm trying to use capslock. I had it working (but with the mentioned problem) in kde, by using kde keyboard settings to make capslock another escape. Since that's problematic, there's an option to make capslock "another hyper" but I don't know what hyper really means.
2014-03-13 02:14:52	ski	shakar : if you must, you can e.g. type `cat' or `cat -vT > /dev/null' or something like that, and see what escape sequence is sent
2014-03-13 02:15:17	yaymukund	ski: it found the original one. In my custom screenrc, I was basically doing: `source .screenrc ; screen -t .. ; screen -t .. ; ..`
2014-03-13 02:15:44	yaymukund	if I move the `source` to *after* my `screen -t` commands, it inherits UTF-8 as expected
2014-03-13 02:15:47	ski	ok, `<Caps_Lock>' probably doesn't send *any* escape sequence on its own, by default
2014-03-13 02:15:59	ski	hm
2014-03-13 02:16:41	yaymukund	err, nm, sorry. I spoke too soon. I was testing incorrectly
2014-03-13 02:16:47	ski	"hyper" is just another kind of modifier like `<Shift>',`<Ctrl>',`<Meta>',`<Hyper>',`<Super>'
2014-03-13 02:16:47	yaymukund	ski: ^
2014-03-13 02:18:16	yaymukund	anyway, whatever. I'm happy screen -U worked. :D
2014-03-13 02:19:24	ski	<https://www.google.com/search?q=space+cadet+keyboard&tbm=isch> has some pics of keyboards with those modifiers
2014-03-13 02:19:53	shakar	ski: thanks. so you don't know of a way to get capslock to be the command key?
2014-03-13 02:20:22	ski	yaymukund : hm, strange

2014-03-13 19:37:20	mintux	ski: ok but i want it has different name both screen is writing in a file 
2014-03-13 19:37:50	ski	it is also possible to use to Screen `chdir /some/other/path/' command, before using the `screen' command to create the window, to change the current window of Screen, and therefore also the directory of the Screen window get set to the current dir of Screen when the window was created
2014-03-13 19:38:24	ski	mintux : how do you start the two Screen sessions ?
2014-03-13 19:38:39	mintux	ski: in man screen wrote: 
2014-03-13 19:38:40	mintux	logfile filename
2014-03-13 19:38:41	ski	using two separate calls to `screen' ?
2014-03-13 19:38:41	mintux	logfile flush secs
2014-03-13 19:38:47	mintux	yup
2014-03-13 19:39:02	mintux	$ screen -LdmS myScriptSec bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:39:15	mintux	$ screen -dmS myScript bash "./1.sh" -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:39:19	ski	using the same, or a different, `-c /path/to/my_screenrc_file' ?
2014-03-13 19:39:33	ski	mhm, ok
2014-03-13 19:39:44	mintux	but scr.0 doesn't create
2014-03-13 19:39:57	mintux	$ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:39:58	mintux	log on
2014-03-13 19:39:58	mintux	logfile "scr.%n"
2014-03-13 19:40:43	ski	well, as i said before, i think you want
2014-03-13 19:40:55	ski	$ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:41:20	ski	also, replace `log on' with `deflog on', changing the default setting
2014-03-13 19:41:41	ski	(otherwise, i think when your `log on' is executed there, the window doesn't exist yet, so it has no effect
2014-03-13 19:41:55	mintux	let $ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:41:58	mintux	$ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:42:05	mintux	oh
2014-03-13 19:42:06	mintux	ok
2014-03-13 19:42:26	ski	in case you don't want to log *every* window of that session, you need to incorporate the `bash "./1.sh"' into the `/home/mrg/Temp/mySetting' file
2014-03-13 19:42:34	mintux	and delogfile  ?
2014-03-13 19:42:45	ski	  $ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting

2014-03-13 19:43:10	ski	  log on
2014-03-13 19:43:32	mintux	right now is: $ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:43:32	mintux	log on
2014-03-13 19:43:32	mintux	logfile "scr.%n"
2014-03-13 19:43:33	ski	or, probably better
2014-03-13 19:43:34	mintux	change it?
2014-03-13 19:43:35	ski	  $ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:43:38	ski	  logfile "scr.%n"

2014-03-13 19:43:53	ski	  $ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:44:04	ski	`-L' there turns on logging from the start
2014-03-13 19:44:51	ski	anway, if you start the Screen session from a different current directory, i don't think you need the `logfile' command there
2014-03-13 19:45:06	ski	(though if you want/prefer it, why not ?)
2014-03-13 19:45:40	mintux	ski: if i don't any choice then i start screen in different path
2014-03-13 19:46:07	ski	s/any/have any/
2014-03-13 19:46:15	ski	?
2014-03-13 19:46:39	mintux	ski: because it wrote in man file then i think i can change the name log file 
2014-03-13 19:46:42	mintux	have any
2014-03-13 19:47:05	ski	you could also do
2014-03-13 19:47:10	ski	  $ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:47:15	ski	  chdir /home/mrg/Temp/
2014-03-13 19:47:18	ski	  screen -t 'some important script' -L bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:47:34	ski	then it would create `/home/mrg/Temp/screenlog.0', instead of somewhere else
2014-03-13 19:47:52	mintux	so if i run another screen
2014-03-13 19:48:05	mintux	then it write the log on /home/mrg/Temp/screenlog.0 too
2014-03-13 19:48:12	ski	no
2014-03-13 19:48:24	ski	only if you also use the same `-c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting' for that one as well
2014-03-13 19:48:51	mintux	there is two thing
2014-03-13 19:48:56	ski	but if you use `logfile "scr.%n"', then in such case both sessions will also use `scr.0'
2014-03-13 19:48:57	mintux	screen name and flush time
2014-03-13 19:49:12	mintux	it write log on file every 10 seconds that i want decrease it
2014-03-13 19:49:16	ski	yes, you probably don't need to fiddle with the flush stuff
2014-03-13 19:49:55	mintux	let met test both chdir
2014-03-13 19:50:20	mintux	and logfile
2014-03-13 19:50:21	ski	if you want to reuse the same `/home/mrg/Temp/mySetting' for two different sessions, then i recommend not using `chdir' (at least not an absolute one) within it, instead making sure to start the sessions from different directories (and then if you really want to, you could have `logfile ...' in `/home/mrg/Temp/mySetting', though it wouldn't be needed)
2014-03-13 19:50:39	ski	`chdir' changes the current working directory of Screen
2014-03-13 19:50:49	mintux	so
2014-03-13 19:50:54	mintux	i don't need it 
2014-03-13 19:50:56	mintux	chdir
2014-03-13 19:50:58	mintux	but 
2014-03-13 19:50:59	mintux	i say 
2014-03-13 19:51:05	mintux	logfile "scr.%n"
2014-03-13 19:51:08	ski	if you make a new window with a process, they will inherit the current working directory of screen (with one exception)
2014-03-13 19:51:10	mintux	doesn't work for me
2014-03-13 19:51:14	mintux	let met test again
2014-03-13 19:51:31	mintux	i put logfile "scr.%n" in /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:51:45	mintux	$ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:51:45	mintux	logfile "scr.%n"
2014-03-13 19:51:50	ski	the process may further decide to change its current working directory, but if you turn logging on and off for the window, it will always write to a file relative to the *window's* working directory
2014-03-13 19:51:53	mintux	now i start session with this setting?:
2014-03-13 19:52:03	mintux	$ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:52:21	ski	mintux : what is current working directory before that ?
2014-03-13 19:52:22	mintux	this
2014-03-13 19:52:24	ski	  $ pwd
2014-03-13 19:52:27	mintux	$ screen -LdmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh"
2014-03-13 19:52:33	mintux	/home/mrg
2014-03-13 19:52:36	ski	ok
2014-03-13 19:52:55	ski	so it should create `/home/mrg/scr.0', then
2014-03-13 19:52:55	mintux	ski: worked
2014-03-13 19:53:35	mintux	ski: but i tried it before same and i have no idea why it didn't work
2014-03-13 19:53:49	ski	mhm
2014-03-13 19:53:53	mintux	it doesn't create log with new scr.0 name
2014-03-13 19:54:05	mintux	but it does now
2014-03-13 19:54:31	mintux	it was very nice if i can set logfile name inside screen command instead put in a file
2014-03-13 19:55:02	mintux	like $ screen -dmS myScript -c /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting bash "./1.sh" -L "scr.0"
2014-03-13 19:55:06	mintux	or whatever 
2014-03-13 19:55:34	mintux	maybe i can give this suggestion to developer ?
2014-03-13 19:55:43	ski	hmm
2014-03-13 19:55:49	ski	i suppose you could try something like
2014-03-13 19:56:08	ski	  logfile $MY_SCREEN_LOGFILE_BASENAME.%n
2014-03-13 19:56:23	ski	and then set `MY_SCREEN_LOGFILE_BASENAME' to something before starting `screen'
2014-03-13 19:56:39	mintux	hmmmm
2014-03-13 19:56:49	mintux	smart trick
2014-03-13 19:56:56	mintux	let me test
2014-03-13 19:58:54	mintux	ski: not worked. $ cat /home/mrg/Temp/mySetting
2014-03-13 19:58:54	mintux	logfile "$yoho.%n"
2014-03-13 19:59:08	mintux	yoho="hajaasan"

2014-03-13 20:02:19	mintux	let met set environment variable 
2014-03-13 20:02:41	ski	it should be set outside of the Screen rc-file, in this case
2014-03-13 20:02:55	ski	either in a shell from which you start Screen, or by using `env' as above
2014-03-13 20:04:08	mintux	what is your version ?

2014-03-13 20:04:41	ski	but i don't think this matter that much
2014-03-13 20:04:54	mintux	hmm i try again
2014-03-13 20:05:25	mintux	-t is important here?
2014-03-13 20:05:40	ski	no, it just gives a title to the Screen window
2014-03-13 20:05:45	mintux	hmm
2014-03-13 20:07:34	mintux	ski: oh solved 
2014-03-13 20:07:52	ski	ok ?
2014-03-13 20:08:45	mintux	yes fixed
2014-03-13 20:08:48	mintux	it worked

2014-03-13 21:23:30	skered	is there any way to have screen remember split between deatch/attach?
2014-03-13 21:29:24	ski	with the dev version, yes, using `layout'
2014-03-13 21:30:01	ski	see "New screen features available" by Michael Schroeder in 2007-02-06 at <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/screen-users/2007-02/msg00000.html> and in 2007-02-08 at <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/screen-users/2007-02/msg00009.html>
2014-03-13 21:30:58	ski	otherwise, if you don't have `layout' in your version, the best you can do is make a nested session. one outer session whidh is attached to the inner one
2014-03-13 21:31:23	ski	you use the inner one for work, but when you detach and attach, you do it for the other one
2014-03-13 21:31:46	ski	the outer one stays attached to the inner, and so remembers split layout
2014-03-13 21:32:20	ski	you can have multiple windows in the outer one, for easy switching between multiple "layouts"
2014-03-13 21:33:22	skered	If this is from 2007 how old is 4.0.3 (my installed version)?
2014-03-13 21:34:04	ski	2006 or something, i don't recall
2014-03-13 21:34:11	skered	Damn
2014-03-13 21:34:14	ski	Screen hasn't had a new release in years
2014-03-13 21:34:53	ski	however Debian (and thus Ubuntu), and possibly some other distros have backpatched some of these new features from the dev version into their packages
2014-03-13 21:36:06	ski	the new features mentioned above also include horizontally splitting your Screen display into two (or more) columns of regions beside each other, and also a feature for grouping windows (a bit like directories and subdirectories of windows)
2014-03-13 21:36:36	ski	skered : so, first check whether your Screen version actually supports `layout' or not
2014-03-13 21:37:48	ski	try e.g. `^A:layout show'
2014-03-13 21:38:01	skered	Nope
2014-03-13 21:38:38	skered	I'm build from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/screen.git right now

2014-03-13 21:38:43	ski	ok
2014-03-13 21:40:38	ski	skered : <http://paste.lisp.org/display/139110> has some suggestions for how you can bind the `layout' commands to keys
2014-03-13 21:41:17	skered	Thanks
2014-03-13 21:42:38	ski	using that, you can use `^Aln' and `^Alp' to switch to next and previous layout, and `^Al0',`^Al1', &c. switches to layouts numbered `0',`1',&c.
2014-03-13 21:46:14	ski	and `^Al?' will display a "help" page, showing the current bindings available for the escape prefix `^Al'

2014-03-17 09:42:37	Pendrag0n	Hey guys, so end up sometimes with 15 or more windows in my screen.  And in each window sometimes upto 15 vim sessions.  This winter has been hell on this location, keep loosing power.  I have battery backups, but I just had to power down, yet again.  Is there any way to save your screen session, to a file or something, so they can be loaded back up after a reboot?
2014-03-17 09:43:05	Pendrag0n	if so, I'd love to turn that into a script and put it in the rc local, and the shutdown so it happens automatically.
2014-03-17 09:43:47	Pendrag0n	I could forsee a problem with that would be that the processes in each window wouldn't be there to restore, but perhaps the last command could be ran again for each window.  
2014-03-17 09:43:59	Pendrag0n	I can see why it would be a pain though, I am hoping someone has tackled it before
2014-03-17 09:50:39	twb	Pendrag0n: no
2014-03-17 09:51:07	twb	Pendrag0n: if you are on linux, you can look at checkpoint/restore ("CXR"), also look at hibernating to swap.
2014-03-17 09:51:18	twb	Pendrag0n: and buy a UPS so you have time to suspend to swap
2014-03-17 09:51:48	Pendrag0n	twb: my UPS gives me 72 minutes, so I think I have that set.
2014-03-17 09:52:02	Pendrag0n	twb: but we lost power for 4 hours today.
2014-03-17 09:52:04	Pendrag0n	again.
2014-03-17 09:52:14	Pendrag0n	I am on linux, debian/ubuntu
2014-03-17 09:53:09	twb	All you can do is run on UPS until you have about 5 minutes left, then hibernate, and wait for power to come back
2014-03-17 09:53:17	Pendrag0n	CXR, to swap, sounds worth looking into
2014-03-17 09:53:18	twb	If that's not good enough, buy a backup generator or a bigger UPS
2014-03-17 09:53:26	twb	CXR is not really what you want
2014-03-17 09:53:44	Pendrag0n	don't you need some power to even hibrinate though?
2014-03-17 09:53:46	twb	That's more for dumping state so you can move between VMs, and it's not very reliable
2014-03-17 09:53:51	twb	hibernate does not need power
2014-03-17 09:53:58	twb	It writes RAM to the swap partition on the hard disk
2014-03-17 09:54:16	twb	suspend[-to-RAM] needs power, hibernate[-to-swap] does not
2014-03-17 09:54:24	Pendrag0n	oh okay.  I wonder if an old del power edge can handle it, I thought that was just a windows feature, and I don't like windows, so I don't know much about it.
2014-03-17 09:54:39	twb	No, linux systems do it
2014-03-17 09:54:55	Pendrag0n	cool, hardware dependent?  I think this server is 8 years old.
2014-03-17 09:54:57	twb	Talk to #debian on freenode about it
2014-03-17 09:54:59	Pendrag0n	there abouts
2014-03-17 09:55:02	Pendrag0n	true
2014-03-17 09:55:16	Pendrag0n	and this is a great solution for the problem I proposed, so thank you.
2014-03-17 09:55:33	twb	You will still lose all your open network connections of course
2014-03-17 09:55:46	Pendrag0n	still, more or less for learning purposes, is there a way to supsend just a screen session?  I mean, other than detatching and reataching, it?
2014-03-17 09:56:02	Pendrag0n	no that's fine, none of my editing is over a network really
2014-03-17 09:56:11	Pendrag0n	just local files, different projects, one window per project
2014-03-17 09:56:17	Pendrag0n	and a window for each log tailed.
2014-03-17 09:56:56	Pendrag0n	twb: thank you by the way, I like that idea, that way I can set the server up to auto-hibrinate when the UPS gets to 5% power left.
2014-03-17 09:57:31	twb	If your server is running nut, yes
2014-03-17 09:57:49	twb	or apcupsd
2014-03-17 09:58:39	Pendrag0n	Well, thanks!  gotta get back to work

2014-03-17 19:11:10	Soliton	you can use ^[ but i doubt that is a good idea.
2014-03-17 19:11:28	kayneo	Soliton, excuse me how to change the command key 'C-a' to 'Alt' y
2014-03-17 19:11:56	kayneo	what the expression in SCREEN of 'Alt' while 'ctrl' is '^'
2014-03-17 19:12:12	kayneo	what's the expression in SCREEN of 'Alt' while 'ctrl' is '^'
2014-03-17 19:13:37	Soliton	it's a terminal thing. nothing specific to screen.
2014-03-17 19:13:50	Soliton	and alt is ^[ as i mentioned.
2014-03-17 19:14:16	Soliton	however it will not work well since it just produces anything when pressed together with another key.
2014-03-17 19:14:33	kayneo	thank you, but why you dont's think it's a good idea
2014-03-17 19:15:25	Soliton	well, i just explained that. just try for yourself: screen -e '^[a'

2014-03-17 19:18:58	Soliton	press alt+c and it'll create a new window.
2014-03-17 19:19:09	Soliton	anyhow, in short: no, you cannot do what you're trying.
2014-03-17 19:21:02	kayneo	I just want to do this thing: when I press'alt+enter', it creats a new region hirozonally with a bash terminal, just as i3wm do
2014-03-17 19:21:32	kayneo	so, if i don't change the command key, how to realize this aim?

2014-03-25 18:08:42	sybariten	considering that i use the word "hate" about this, you can imagine that my life in general is quite mellow
2014-03-25 18:08:58	sybariten	besides, it might be some kind of putty problem

2014-03-26 22:16:28	ScottG489	What's the setting that enables/disables the allowance for ctrl to be held down when issuing commands. For example, to get into copy mode you can press ctrl+a, ctrl+[ when really the binding is only ctrl+a, [
2014-03-26 22:17:13	ScottG489	It makes it easier since you don't need to release ctrl as quickly. I think it's enabled by default
2014-03-26 22:26:14	ski	oskie : your termcap/terminfo DB didn't specify your terminal (`TERM' value `putty-256color') supported 256 colors. the `termcapinfo' Screen command adds a patch to this (but is of course only seen by Screen. other programs reading termcap/terminfo for `putty-256color' still doesn't see it. hence this is a workaround)

2014-03-26 22:44:14	ski	ScottG489 : .. `^A^?',`^A^H' for `prev'; `^A]',`^A^]' for `paste .'; `^A\',`^A^\' for `quit'; `^Al',`^A^L' for `redisplay'; `^Ac',`^A^C' for `screen'; `^Az',`^A^Z' for `suspend'; `^At',`^A^T' for `time', `^Aw',`^A^W' for `windows'; `^Ar',`^A^R' for `wrap'; `^As',`^A^S' for `xoff'; ^Aq',`^A^Q' for `xon'
2014-03-26 22:46:32	ski	but e.g. `^Ai' is `info' while `^A^I' is `focus' (because `<tab>' sends `^I'); or `^Ah' is `hardcopy' while `^A^H' is `prev' (since `<backspace>' sometimes send `^H')
2014-03-26 22:47:05	ski	or `^Av' is `version' while `^A^V' is `digraph'
2014-03-26 22:48:08	ski	rudi_s : i've sometimes noticed glitches with the hardstatus simulated by a line in the ordinary rectangular text display ..
2014-03-26 22:48:52	rudi_s	ski: Hm, ok. I'll look if it happens again and try to debug it if I can.
2014-03-26 22:49:44	ski	rudi_s : .. mostly when trying to display utf in the hardstatus, or when trying to use escape sequences (like ANSI color escapes, ECMA-48), iirc, though
2014-03-26 22:50:02	rudi_s	Hm, I don't do that, just plain ascii.
2014-03-26 22:51:23	ski	ScottG489 : there could maybe be a setting like that in X or something, at the level of keyboard events and such ..

2014-03-28 14:24:57	Zerker	Gurus resident?
2014-03-28 14:25:35	twb	What's the real question?
2014-03-28 14:26:24	Zerker	I'm on ssh to a program that moves the cursor around one character at a time, is there a way to consolidate those somehow?
2014-03-28 14:27:37	Zerker	Basically, I'm in the middle of a line, I type one letter and watch the display be updated and then my cursor sloooowly zoom back to its proper position
2014-03-28 14:28:12	twb	Well you can cheat
2014-03-28 14:28:24	twb	e.g. | grep ^
2014-03-28 14:28:29	Zerker	(I type multiple characters, or Alt-B several times, etc., I watch this happen for each action)
2014-03-28 14:28:47	twb	|sponge will wait until the output finishes completely
2014-03-28 14:31:22	Zerker	Okay so no screen primitive in the spirit of "emulate a sane terminal from an insane one", maybe I should be in #bash after all
2014-03-28 14:31:33	Zerker	Can sponge interpolate cursor movement escapes?
2014-03-28 14:31:58	Zerker	(one can't sed on a per-character basis right?)
2014-03-28 14:33:56	 *	Zerker remembers about the existence of rlwrap
2014-03-28 14:34:19	Zerker	Yeah that should work, thanks for your time/attention ^-^
2014-03-28 14:35:02	twb	No it'll just batch them
2014-03-28 14:35:21	twb	So you'll get (I guess) one packet instead of a bunch
2014-03-28 14:35:51	twb	libreadline also includes its own equivalent called rle
2014-03-28 14:36:11	twb	but yeah if rlwrap is working for you, problem solved

2014-03-29 04:59:33	oskie	oh, I solved it by adding a termcapinfo line
2014-03-29 05:01:00	oskie	termcapinfo putty-256color 'hs:ts=\E]0;:fs=\007:ds=\E]0;\007'   for the record

2014-04-01 23:39:47	RadoQ	Moin. When I connect to an existing screen from "xterm", then I can add new sessions from within several times without issues. When I connect from "putty", I can add only 1 new session, because then the meta-key gets _totally_ ignored until the new session is terminated and closed. When I, however, set "defflow off" before opening the 1st new session in "putty", then I can add many more sessions since the meta-key never stops working. What can cause this
2014-04-01 23:40:53	RadoQ	The intriguiing part is that "defflow off" is already set in .screenrc, so it should have been off all along from the start, yet I must explicitely set it interactively for the meta-key to work again.
2014-04-01 23:42:46	RadoQ	It may be unrelated to the "flow" feature, perhaps only the interactive input is relevant. However, when I set "defflow on", then the meta-key stops working again.
2014-04-01 23:42:50	RadoQ	Very confusing.

2014-04-03 05:36:01	RadoQ	ski, no cut-off, what's unclear/ missing?
2014-04-03 05:41:04	ski	there was no "." or "!" or "?" after the "What can cause this" part, unlike your other sentences, hence i was wondering if there was anything cut off

2014-04-03 05:49:27	ski	oh. ok, i see
2014-04-03 05:58:51	josvuk	screen -r starts an exited screen session again, Can I store a screen session for working with it the next day?
2014-04-03 05:58:59	josvuk	How to do this?
2014-04-03 05:59:40	ski	(nitpick, it attaches to (not starts) a detached Screen session again)
2014-04-03 06:00:45	ski	if you don't turn off your computer, then the detached session will keep running on it, with processes inside running without noticing any change, so that you can attach later
