2013-09-09 19:15:17	notdan	Hi
2013-09-09 19:15:58	notdan	can somebody explain to me the "monadic F-algebras", by which I mean F-algebras where F is a monad?
2013-09-09 19:16:19	notdan	I also heard the terms monadic algebras, T-algebras (is that the same thing?), algebra over a monad
2013-09-09 19:16:50	notdan	I read on the internet that monadic algebras can express algebraic theories with axioms
2013-09-09 19:17:06	notdan	But I don't really understand how
2013-09-09 19:41:32	Saizan_	a nice exercise is to check that the T-algebras of the List monad are exactly the monoids
2013-09-09 19:48:54	Saizan_	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)#Algebras_for_a_monad <- unless you need calrifications over this definition
2013-09-09 19:53:29	notdan	ok, so T-algebra = algebra for a monad?
2013-09-09 19:54:11	notdan	Sorry for stupid questions like that but the only reference I found was ncatlab, and their pages are v dense
2013-09-09 19:56:13	Saizan_	yep, they are the sae
2013-09-09 19:56:17	Saizan_	*same
2013-09-09 20:01:15	notdan	hm, I think I don't understand the exercise. T-algebra is a pair (T,h). For the List monad we have ([], h) and List(h) = map h, right? Join/mu is concat
2013-09-09 20:01:28	notdan	What I don't understand is what does it mean that ([], h) is a monoid

2013-09-09 20:11:42	Saizan_	a T-algebra is not a pair (T,h)
2013-09-09 20:11:52	Saizan_	it's a pair (A, h : T A -> A)
2013-09-09 20:12:18	notdan	ok, sorry, I clearly got it wrong. I think I understand it now
2013-09-09 20:12:36	notdan	I am to prove that if T = List, than A is a monoid and h : [A] -> A is 'mconcat'?
2013-09-09 20:12:45	Saizan_	yeah
2013-09-09 20:12:49	notdan	I see, thanks

2013-09-09 21:50:13	notdan	I only managed to prove it into one direction :( that every monoid gives a rise to a T-algebra
2013-09-09 21:50:40	notdan	The other way around I can't even prove that mconcat[mempty, a] = a
2013-09-09 21:55:07	notdan	Hm, I just realized that I haven't used any of the monad laws...
2013-09-09 21:55:39	Saizan	remember the l
2013-09-09 21:55:51	Saizan	laws you have about h too
2013-09-09 21:57:37	notdan	The only laws about 'h' I have are: "h . concat = h . map h" and "h . singleton = id"
2013-09-09 21:59:05	Saizan	yep
2013-09-09 21:59:39	-->	tac (~tac-tics@cip-248.trustwave.com) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-09-09 22:04:08	notdan	ok, h [ h[], a ] = <a = h[a]> = h[h[],h[a]] = h (map h [[],[a]]) =  <T-alg law> = h[concat [[],[a]] = h[a] = a
2013-09-09 22:04:52	Saizan	right :)
2013-09-09 22:04:58	notdan	Thx :) Now that I wrote it down it looks so easy, why did it take so much time for me to come up with this though...
2013-09-09 22:06:26	notdan	The same trick can be used to show that the assoc. law hold: h[h[a,b],c] = h[h[a,b],h[c]] = h (map h [[a,b],[c]]) = h [a,b,c]
2013-09-09 22:06:38	notdan	But I didn't need any of the monad laws for that
2013-09-09 22:07:29	Saizan	well, in this case the monad is fixed to List, so you can get away with just computation
2013-09-09 22:11:26	notdan	Oh, true :)
2013-09-09 22:16:31	notdan	Where can I read more about T-algebras? I am interested about initial T-algebras and relation between T-coalgebras and Kleisli arrows (because they looks kinda similar)
2013-09-09 22:18:53	Saizan	i guess you could look for "Ellenberg-Moore category" which is the name for the category of T-algebras

2013-09-12 09:11:58	shachaf	But your condition is stronger than a skeleton. I don't think it's even true?

2013-09-13 11:34:21	cads2	I'd like to understand a type of combinatorial design, and see if I can do a naive analysis of its geometry, and error correction properties (which I'm expecting won't be too great)
2013-09-13 11:35:39	<--	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
2013-09-13 11:35:45	cads2	The structure is just a  n x n matrix valued in {0, 1}, where each column and row must add up to a constant.
2013-09-13 11:36:47	cads2	If the constant is m, then the matrix is equivalent to a doubly stochastic matrix where each entry is either 0 or 1/m.
2013-09-13 11:50:57	cads2	Oh, neat. So the doubly stochastic matrices are those matrices with non-negative real entries, where each column sums to 1. It turns out the space of n x n doubly stochastic matrices forms a polytope in R^(n x n), called the Birkhoff polytope.
2013-09-13 11:52:49	cads2	Birkhoff and von Neumann show that the vertices of this polytope are exactly the permutation matrices - that is, those binary matrices that have exactly one entry 1 in each row and each column, and 0s elsewhere.
2013-09-13 11:53:19	arkeet	rows and columns sum to 1, right?
2013-09-13 11:53:43	cads2	ah, yeah, both rows and columns sum to 1.
2013-09-13 11:55:13	cads2	So it turns out that by Birkhoff von and Neumann's theorem, each point in the Birkhoff polytope can be written as a convex sum of permutation matrices.
2013-09-13 11:56:18	arkeet	right, nonnegative.
2013-09-13 12:00:45	cads2	So I'm thinking of  n x n binary matrices with rows and columns that sum to some constant m < n.
2013-09-13 12:00:55	cads2	I'm not sure what to call them yet.
2013-09-13 12:01:52	cads2	But it might turn out that for such a matrix M, we can write M as a sum of m disjoint permutation matrices P_1 .. P_m.
2013-09-13 12:03:41	cads2	Here I mean that two permutation matrices P and Q are disjoint if there are no shared entries P_ij = Q_ij = 1.
2013-09-13 12:06:20	cads2	It's not hard to see that the sum of m mutually disjoint permutation matrices must be matrices of the type I'm considering. But I'm not yet sure if we can go the other way - there might be a matrix that can't be decomposed in terms of permutation matrices.
2013-09-13 12:07:32	cads2	I'm going to call my matrices "n x n binary matrices of thickness m"
2013-09-13 12:09:13	cads2	and note that given a binary matrix M of thickness m, we can produce a doubly stochastic matrix by scalar multiplication: N = (1/m)*M
2013-09-13 12:11:01	arkeet	cads2: I think you can go the other way. you should try to prove it.
2013-09-13 12:13:25	arkeet	I'm pretty sure you can.
2013-09-13 12:13:41	arkeet	if you have some binary matrix like that,
2013-09-13 12:14:06	arkeet	you can always subtract off a permutation matrix. (maybe appeal to birkhoff-von neumann for this.)
2013-09-13 12:14:29	arkeet	repeat until you're left with all zeros.
2013-09-13 12:15:09	arkeet	actually, that's true of any integer matrix with constant row and column sums.
2013-09-13 12:15:18	arkeet	that it's an integer linear combination of permutation matrices.
2013-09-13 12:15:30	arkeet	(you can insert "nonnegative" everywhere.)
2013-09-13 12:15:32	cads2	oh?
2013-09-13 12:16:04	arkeet	what I mean is:
2013-09-13 12:16:27	arkeet	say you have some matrix of nonnegative integers.
2013-09-13 12:16:32	arkeet	such that the rows and columns add up to some m > 0
2013-09-13 12:16:47	arkeet	by that theorem, your matrix is some nonnegative linear combination of permutation matrices.
2013-09-13 12:17:01	cads2	oh, right
2013-09-13 12:17:03	arkeet	pick one of those permutation matrices with a nonzero coefficient..
2013-09-13 12:17:09	arkeet	subtract it off.
2013-09-13 12:17:22	arkeet	then you're left with another such matrix, where the row/column sums are m-1
2013-09-13 12:17:29	arkeet	then induction
2013-09-13 12:17:47	cads2	the only part I don't see is that the linear combination coefficients must be integers
2013-09-13 12:18:06	arkeet	that's precisely what I just proved though.
2013-09-13 12:18:25	arkeet	it's trivially true for m = 0, and then I just gave the induction step.
2013-09-13 12:18:51	arkeet	each time you're subtracting off a whole permutation matrix.
2013-09-13 12:19:11	arkeet	so it shows that your matrix was a sum of permutation matrices to begin with.
2013-09-13 12:20:27	arkeet	you can always subtract off a whole permutation matrix, because any nonzero entry is at least 1.
2013-09-13 12:21:35	cads2	if we have an integer matrix M of constant thickness m, we can turn it into a doubly stochastic matrix N =  (1/m)*M, after which birkhoff von neumann says that  N = a_1 * P_1 + a_2 * P_2... + a_k * P_k, where P_1 .. P_k are permutation matrices and a_1 + a_2 +... + a_k = 1.
2013-09-13 12:22:51	cads2	but it doesn't say that a_i * m will be an integer.
2013-09-13 12:23:05	arkeet	no, but it is at least 1.
2013-09-13 12:23:47	arkeet	simply because the nonzero entries of M are at least 1.
2013-09-13 12:24:31	arkeet	which means you can subtract P_i, and you'll be left with another integer matrix, but this time of constant thickness m-1.
2013-09-13 12:24:39	arkeet	nonnegative integer matrix.
2013-09-13 12:24:51	arkeet	you repeat this until the thickness is 0.
2013-09-13 12:26:52	cads2	I'm just not sure that we're ruling out the necessity of permutation matrix decompositions where permutation matrices contribute only fractional amounts.
2013-09-13 12:27:05	arkeet	?
2013-09-13 12:27:23	arkeet	ok look.
2013-09-13 12:27:42	arkeet	so we have M = a_1 P_1 + ... + a_k P_k, where M has constant thickness m, and a_1 + ... + a_k = m
2013-09-13 12:27:45	arkeet	right?
2013-09-13 12:27:48	arkeet	(different a_i from yours.)
2013-09-13 12:27:52	arkeet	and each a_i is nonnegative.
2013-09-13 12:28:37	arkeet	ok so far?
2013-09-13 12:28:42	cads2	right
2013-09-13 12:28:47	arkeet	ok, so say a_k > 0.
2013-09-13 12:29:23	arkeet	because the other terms are all nonnegative, M >= a_k P_k.
2013-09-13 12:29:48	arkeet	(where >= means each entry is >=)
2013-09-13 12:29:57	arkeet	in particular
2013-09-13 12:30:13	arkeet	each entry in M corresponding to a 1 in P_k
2013-09-13 12:30:14	arkeet	is positive.
2013-09-13 12:30:19	arkeet	right?
2013-09-13 12:30:29	cads2	my concern is that there may be some matrix M for which some subset of the entries a_i are forced to be non integers. We seem to be assuming a-priori that there exists a decomposition where a_1 + ... + a_k = m  /and/ each a_i is an integer.
2013-09-13 12:30:34	arkeet	that's fine!
2013-09-13 12:30:36	arkeet	just bear with me.
2013-09-13 12:30:41	cads2	ok
2013-09-13 12:30:43	arkeet	do you agree with my last statement?
2013-09-13 12:30:53	arkeet	I'm not assuming a_i are integers.
2013-09-13 12:30:58	cads2	okay
2013-09-13 12:31:07	cads2	following so far
2013-09-13 12:31:09	arkeet	ok.
2013-09-13 12:31:22	arkeet	so, each entry in M corresponding to a 1 in P_k is positive.
2013-09-13 12:31:30	arkeet	but because M is an integer matrix, those entries are all at least 1.
2013-09-13 12:31:38	arkeet	so, M >= P_k.
2013-09-13 12:32:17	cads2	yes
2013-09-13 12:32:28	arkeet	so, M - P_k is a nonnegative integer matrix.
2013-09-13 12:32:32	arkeet	it has constant thickness m-1.
2013-09-13 12:32:45	arkeet	now, induction.
2013-09-13 12:32:49	cads2	oh, bam
2013-09-13 12:32:55	arkeet	:)
2013-09-13 12:34:12	arkeet	it's certainly true that the a_k don't all have to be integers.
2013-09-13 12:34:21	arkeet	they could even all be less than 1.
2013-09-13 12:34:59	cads2	so say there's some mumbojumbo where a single entry in M is 1, but gets fractional contributions from more than one P_i. We can still subtract any of those P_i from M, since any position in M that they contribute to must have value of at least 1.
2013-09-13 12:35:08	arkeet	right.
2013-09-13 12:37:08	arkeet	:)
2013-09-13 12:37:22	cads2	When applied to binary matrices B of thickness m, the induction phase actually gives us a sequence of m mutually disjoint permutation matrices P_i such that B = P_1 + ... + P_m.
2013-09-13 12:37:30	arkeet	right.
2013-09-13 12:37:40	cads2	very nice!
2013-09-13 12:38:37	cads2	I also like that the result extends to thickness m integer matrices.
2013-09-13 12:38:45	arkeet	yes
2013-09-13 12:38:58	cads2	I'm thinking it would be possible to massage the result to extend to thickness m real valued matrices as well
2013-09-13 12:39:25	arkeet	I don't know what the generalization would be.
2013-09-13 12:40:17	cads2	we'd let  k be the smallest entry of the matrix, and pull off a scaled permutation matrix  k * P_i
2013-09-13 12:40:22	arkeet	sure.
2013-09-13 12:40:30	arkeet	the trouble, though, is you might not finish in finitely many steps.
2013-09-13 12:40:38	cads2	since M >= k * P_i
2013-09-13 12:40:43	arkeet	since there is no smallest positive real.
2013-09-13 12:41:05	cads2	pulling off that k * P_i would turn one entry to zero
2013-09-13 12:41:16	arkeet	oh.
2013-09-13 12:41:17	arkeet	duh
2013-09-13 12:41:21	cads2	so you'd reduce the matrix to a zero matrix in at most n x n steps
2013-09-13 12:41:42	arkeet	that's not saying much though.
2013-09-13 12:42:02	arkeet	I don't think you get anything stronger than birkhoff-von neumann itself.
2013-09-13 12:42:18	arkeet	and some other theorem maybe.
2013-09-13 12:42:21	cads2	yeah
2013-09-13 12:42:44	cads2	so doubly stochastic matrices are just real matrices of thickness 1
2013-09-13 12:42:52	arkeet	yeah.
2013-09-13 12:42:56	arkeet	you know the dimension of that space.
2013-09-13 12:43:38	arkeet	and I think there's some theorem that any point in some d-dimensional convex polytope is some convex combination of some d+1 extreme points. or something.
2013-09-13 12:43:54	arkeet	I dunno. it sounds true.
2013-09-13 12:44:10	cads2	and the result you get is that an n x n such matrix can be written as a convex sum of as little as n x n permutation matrices.
2013-09-13 12:44:30	arkeet	I haven't thought about convex geometry in forever.
2013-09-13 12:44:30	cads2	arkeet: ah, that sounds right
2013-09-13 12:44:30	arkeet	it's actually less.
2013-09-13 12:44:30	arkeet	the dimension is (n-1)^2
2013-09-13 12:45:15	cads2	nice
2013-09-13 12:45:23	cads2	this is neat stuff
2013-09-13 12:45:34	cads2	thanks for winging the proof, arkeet!
2013-09-13 12:46:01	arkeet	oh yeah, it's Carathéodory's theorem.
2013-09-13 12:46:56	arkeet	:)

2013-09-13 12:58:58	cads2	Hmm, we've shown that a thickness m binary matrix is a lot easier to decompose than the general case - we only need m < n steps. Also if the matrix is integer with width that's not too large, it's also efficient.
2013-09-13 13:01:38	cads2	And finally, if we have a doubly stochastic matrix with rational entries in lowest terms a_ij/b_ij, we can scale it into a integer matrix of constant width m = Lcm{b_ij}.
2013-09-13 13:04:06	cads2	These are all really just minor corollaries to the birkhoff / von neumann result, but I think they're cute!

2013-09-13 20:19:53	cads2	I can think of a fairly obvious scheme that pulls out a single permutation matrix. Let M be a binary matrix of width m. Take the first column and find a row i such that M_1i = 1. Cross out column 1 and row i, and then repeat the process for the submatrix left over.
2013-09-13 20:21:31	cads2	But I want to say there's got to be a more efficient scheme that scans the matrix from left to right and builds up all m permutation matrices in one go.
2013-09-13 20:35:01	cads2	huh, it turns out that the initial method doesn't work - removing an arbitrary column and row from the matrix doesn't leave you with a constant width submatrix :/

2013-09-15 11:43:19	shachaf	Is there some construction similar to an adjunction that gives rise to a monoid rather than a monad?
2013-09-15 11:54:14	Saizan	a monad is a 2-monad in Cat, maybe there's a bicategory whose 2-monads are monoids? then it's 2-adjunctions should be what you ask
2013-09-15 11:54:49	Saizan	*its
2013-09-15 11:55:38	 *	arkeet wonders what a 2-monad is
2013-09-15 11:56:58	Saizan	well, i just mean monad in a bicategory
2013-09-15 11:56:58	arkeet	I know.
2013-09-15 11:57:53	Saizan	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad#definition_18
2013-09-15 11:58:15	arkeet	I know.
2013-09-15 12:23:50	Cale	shachaf obviously means a monoid in Set
2013-09-15 12:23:59	Cale	hmm
2013-09-15 12:24:56	Saizan	Cale: see #haskell-blah too, shachaf seems to want a notion of adjunction for monoidal categories rather than bicategories
2013-09-15 12:25:08	Cale	ah
2013-09-15 12:25:22	shachaf	I'm not really sure what I want, it was just an idea.
2013-09-15 12:25:25	Cale	Well, hmm. Can't you treat a monoidal category as a 2-category?
2013-09-15 12:25:37	Cale	Monoidal categories are (weak) 2-categories.

2013-09-17 07:05:04	Cale	tac just pinged out, but I agree with him on the category of simple graphs. If you're willing to allow self-loops, then I think you also get exponential objects... or something close anyway.
2013-09-17 07:07:44	Cale	If X and Y are graphs, then you can define the graph Y^X as having the functions V(X) -> V(Y) as its vertices, and two such functions f and g are adjacent in Y^X iff whenever u and v are adjacent in X, the vertices f(u) and g(v) are adjacent in Y.
2013-09-17 07:08:41	Cale	At the very least, I know this has the property that |Hom(A x X, Y)| = |Hom(A, Y^X)|

2013-09-18 10:27:49	engimo_	yeah
2013-09-18 10:28:18	Saizan	yeah, that's fine, i'm talking about the other field

2013-09-18 10:29:19	engimo_	this construction is supposed to let you transition between fibered categories and pseudofunctors
2013-09-18 10:30:33	Saizan	the pseudofunctor being a sort of inverse image of the fibration, right?
2013-09-18 10:31:38	engimo_	yes, you have this problem that you want the fibers in a fibered category to be functorial in some sense
2013-09-18 10:31:47	engimo_	this leads you to the notion of (co)cartesian fibrations in this context
2013-09-18 10:38:48	Saizan	engimo_: yep, though what i'm trying to do is seeing it from a more type theoretical perspective and give it a kind of universal construction definition, as something like a coproduct of all the fibers
2013-09-18 10:40:13	Saizan	or actually more like the dependent pair of an object in the base category and one in the fiber over that
2013-09-18 10:41:19	Saizan	that's how it looks like under the forgetful functor to Set anyway
2013-09-18 10:47:48	Saizan	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+sum#relation_to_type_theory_24 <- i guess i should take inspiration from the table down there

2013-09-25 02:35:51	tac	I've heard the word "concrete" category is kind of a BS term
2013-09-25 02:36:05	tac	Does anyone have any elaboration to that line of thinking? Or did I maybe make it up?

2013-09-25 02:52:30	Cale	It's not BS
2013-09-25 02:53:22	Cale	It's just that every category can be made concrete in a particular way, and the fact that a category is concrete is not usually terribly relevant.
2013-09-25 02:54:35	tac	gotcha
2013-09-25 02:54:55	Cale	You can consider the functor which maps each object X in C to the set of arrows T -> X (union over all objects T in C) and each arrow f: X -> Y with the function which acts on that set by composition.
2013-09-25 02:56:19	Cale	Well, at least all *small* categories can be made concrete
2013-09-25 02:57:05	tac	what is that bit about "union over all objects T in C"?
2013-09-25 02:57:22	Cale	I mean, don't fix a specific T
2013-09-25 02:57:32	Cale	You want *all* the arrows to X.
2013-09-25 02:57:59	tac	gotcha
2013-09-25 02:58:26	tac	So the disjoint union of Hom(T, X) for every T in C
2013-09-25 03:01:40	Cale	yeah
2013-09-25 03:01:55	tac	Neat

2013-10-04 05:09:26	Eduard_Munteanu	Is it enough to require the image of a map between categories is a category itself, for the purpose of defining a functor between those two?
2013-10-04 05:10:44	Eduard_Munteanu	s/is/to be/
2013-10-04 05:11:12	engimo	of course not
2013-10-04 05:11:21	engimo	it's unclear what that even mean
2013-10-04 05:11:21	engimo	s
2013-10-04 05:12:27	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo: suppose you have categories C and D, and two maps Ob(C) -> Ob(D) and Arr(C) -> Arr(D)/
2013-10-04 05:12:34	engimo	sure
2013-10-04 05:13:32	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo: the image of the object map is a subclass of Ob(D), and a similar thing holds for Arr(D).
2013-10-04 05:13:40	engimo	sure
2013-10-04 05:13:44	tac	Eduard_Munteanu: I don't think that works the way you have it stated. You could have the discrete category 2 to itself, mapping the objects to themselves but mapping the id's to the id maps of the other object
2013-10-04 05:14:04	tac	Eduard_Munteanu: The image is a category (because it's all of 2), but it's definitely not a functor
2013-10-04 05:14:37	tac	Eduard_Munteanu: However, your idea _might_ work if you require that the image of every subcategory is still a category
2013-10-04 05:14:39	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo: now I'm asking if you can take Im(Ob) and Im(Arr) and prove that they make a category, then conclude the map is a functor
2013-10-04 05:14:45	engimo	no
2013-10-04 05:14:58	engimo	you need compatibility with the composition, of course
2013-10-04 05:15:15	engimo	take any category and randomly permute the arrows, that hits everything but it's not going to be a sensible category
2013-10-04 05:15:31	Eduard_Munteanu	tac: well ids are 1 to 1 with objects, so you can't really swap just one of them
2013-10-04 05:15:55	-->	PatrickRobotham (~chatzilla@60-241-8-203.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-10-04 05:16:32	tac	Eduard_Munteanu: If 2 is the category with objects 0 and 1, and maps id_0 and id_1, I mean the function F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(id_0) = id_1, and F(id_1) = id_0
2013-10-04 05:17:04	tac	The image is still all of 2, so it meets the criteria you specified (if I understood you)
2013-10-04 05:17:12	Eduard_Munteanu	Okay, let me state my purpose...
2013-10-04 05:17:35	Eduard_Munteanu	I'm representing categories as arrows, objects are identity arrows.
2013-10-04 05:18:31	Eduard_Munteanu	I'm thinking I could define subcategories of D by making a functor F : C -> D and taking its image, in Haskell.
2013-10-04 05:19:18	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo, tac: so actually, if you permute arrows, you permute objects too. Would that be enough?
2013-10-04 05:19:34	engimo	no, the data of a functor is exactly what you need
2013-10-04 05:19:57	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo: what do you mean by "data"?
2013-10-04 05:20:00	engimo	you can't send the arrows anywhere, you need to be compatible with the composition -- there's really no way to shorten that requirement
2013-10-04 05:23:07	Eduard_Munteanu	engimo: hmm, given f and g in the domain, there's an arrow f . g too. Now if you apply the functor, if you have F(f) and F(g), then there has to be an F(f) . F(g). But you're saying F(f . g) might be a different arrow?
2013-10-04 05:24:03	engimo	not if it's a functor, but that's not what you were asking
2013-10-04 05:24:14	engimo	that's literally  the requirement of something being a functor
2013-10-04 05:24:16	Eduard_Munteanu	I see.
2013-10-04 05:25:39	tac	The way I think of functors, they are a pair of mappings (one for the objects, one for the arrows) with the property that the image of any commutative diagram in the domain category has a commutative diagram for its image
2013-10-04 05:25:42	Eduard_Munteanu	Weirdly you can do away with the identity requirement, but not this. :/
2013-10-04 05:25:50	tac	they are mappings that "take commutative diagrams to commutative diagrams"
2013-10-04 05:26:13	Eduard_Munteanu	Hm, yeah.
2013-10-04 05:26:25	engimo	tac: that's not a "way of thinking", that is actually literally just the definition
2013-10-04 05:26:46	tac	engimo: Literally?
2013-10-04 05:26:59	engimo	Literally
2013-10-04 05:27:05	benmachine	I disagree
2013-10-04 05:27:27	benmachine	"literally" it's that but for triangle diagrams
2013-10-04 05:27:56	benmachine	and then it's easy to see that that implies the same for general diagrams
2013-10-04 05:28:12	benmachine	(maybe finite)
2013-10-04 05:28:42	benmachine	wait no
2013-10-04 05:28:46	benmachine	not even that
2013-10-04 05:29:33	benmachine	no that
2013-10-04 05:29:51	engimo	are you drunk
2013-10-04 05:30:01	benmachine	no, just easily-confused
2013-10-04 05:30:42	Saizan	yeah, it says that f . g = f.g goes to F(f) . F(g) = F(f.g), spaces added for emphasis :)
2013-10-04 05:31:01	tomprince	Eduard_Munteanu: Consider the category X with a single object x, and single non-identity arrow a, and 2 the discrete category on two objects y  and z. F(x) = y F(a) = z.
2013-10-04 05:31:16	tomprince	That isn't a functor, even though the image of every subcategory is itself a category.
2013-10-04 05:31:32	Eduard_Munteanu	Hm, I see.

2013-10-04 08:06:47	Saizan	ok, sending 0 to a and 1 to c means the inverse of b is empty, and the pseudofunctor would need to build a functor from the terminal to the empty category
2013-10-04 08:19:12	xplat	yep
2013-10-04 08:24:49	Saizan	so the arrow in 2 was a red herring
2013-10-04 08:26:58	xplat	kind of, but for Conduché it has to exist anyway
2013-10-04 08:27:14	xplat	for fibrant or opfibrant you can make a smaller counterexample

2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[03:02:07] Is there a name for categories arising from arbitrary functors F : C -> D by taking Im(F)?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[03:07:25] That is, if I call it F, Ob_F = { F(A) | A \in Ob_C }, Hom_F(A, B) = { F(f) | f \in Hom_C(A, B) }, id_F(A) = F(id_A), g o_F f = F (g o f)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:26:56] if i have a strong equivalence F : C -> D of categories, with U : D -> E a forgetful functor such that you get an adjunction (U . F) |- G, with G . U = F^-1, do i get a weak equivalence between C and E?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:28:13] for a concrete case C = [B,Cat], D = Fib(B), E = Cat/B
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:33:19] also, is there a rule of thumb to tell if the more appropriate notion to use is strong or weak equivalence?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:34:16] i'm particularly interested in preserving (co)limits
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:41:56] nvm, i don't think the adjunction helps
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:44:45] well, it will for the (co)limits i guess
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[19:26:10] Saizan: i suspect you came to the same conclusion as i did -- it gives you another adjunction, but not necessarily any equivalence
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[19:58:32] xplat: btw, is there a common example of an element of Cat/C which is not a (op)fibration?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:09:26] Is it enough to require the image of a map between categories is a category itself, for the purpose of defining a functor between those two?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:10:44] s/is/to be/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:11:12] of course not
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:11:21] it's unclear what that even mean
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:11:21] s
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:12:27] engimo: suppose you have categories C and D, and two maps Ob(C) -> Ob(D) and Arr(C) -> Arr(D)/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:12:34] sure
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:13:32] engimo: the image of the object map is a subclass of Ob(D), and a similar thing holds for Arr(D).
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:13:40] sure
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:13:44] Eduard_Munteanu: I don't think that works the way you have it stated. You could have the discrete category 2 to itself, mapping the objects to themselves but mapping the id's to the id maps of the other object
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:14:04] Eduard_Munteanu: The image is a category (because it's all of 2), but it's definitely not a functor
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:14:37] Eduard_Munteanu: However, your idea _might_ work if you require that the image of every subcategory is still a category
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:14:39] engimo: now I'm asking if you can take Im(Ob) and Im(Arr) and prove that they make a category, then conclude the map is a functor
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:14:45] no
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:14:58] you need compatibility with the composition, of course
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:15:15] take any category and randomly permute the arrows, that hits everything but it's not going to be a sensible category
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:15:31] tac: well ids are 1 to 1 with objects, so you can't really swap just one of them
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:16:32] Eduard_Munteanu: If 2 is the category with objects 0 and 1, and maps id_0 and id_1, I mean the function F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(id_0) = id_1, and F(id_1) = id_0
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:17:04] The image is still all of 2, so it meets the criteria you specified (if I understood you)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:17:12] Okay, let me state my purpose...
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:17:35] I'm representing categories as arrows, objects are identity arrows.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:18:31] I'm thinking I could define subcategories of D by making a functor F : C -> D and taking its image, in Haskell.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:19:18] engimo, tac: so actually, if you permute arrows, you permute objects too. Would that be enough?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:19:34] no, the data of a functor is exactly what you need
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:19:57] engimo: what do you mean by "data"?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:20:00] you can't send the arrows anywhere, you need to be compatible with the composition -- there's really no way to shorten that requirement
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:23:07] engimo: hmm, given f and g in the domain, there's an arrow f . g too. Now if you apply the functor, if you have F(f) and F(g), then there has to be an F(f) . F(g). But you're saying F(f . g) might be a different arrow?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:24:03] not if it's a functor, but that's not what you were asking
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:24:14] that's literally  the requirement of something being a functor
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:24:16] I see.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:25:39] The way I think of functors, they are a pair of mappings (one for the objects, one for the arrows) with the property that the image of any commutative diagram in the domain category has a commutative diagram for its image
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:25:42] Weirdly you can do away with the identity requirement, but not this. :/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:25:50] they are mappings that "take commutative diagrams to commutative diagrams"
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:26:13] Hm, yeah.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:26:25] tac: that's not a "way of thinking", that is actually literally just the definition
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tac	[05:26:46] engimo: Literally?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:26:59] Literally
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:27:05] I disagree
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:27:27] "literally" it's that but for triangle diagrams
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:27:56] and then it's easy to see that that implies the same for general diagrams
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:28:12] (maybe finite)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:28:42] wait no
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:28:46] not even that
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:29:33] no that
2013-10-06 09:57:39	engimo	[05:29:51] are you drunk
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benmachine	[05:30:01] no, just easily-confused
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[05:30:42] yeah, it says that f . g = f.g goes to F(f) . F(g) = F(f.g), spaces added for emphasis :)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tomprince	[05:31:01] Eduard_Munteanu: Consider the category X with a single object x, and single non-identity arrow a, and 2 the discrete category on two objects y  and z. F(x) = y F(a) = z.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	tomprince	[05:31:16] That isn't a functor, even though the image of every subcategory is itself a category.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:31:32] Hm, I see.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[07:09:25] Saizan: look up 'Conduché functor' on ncatlab, there was an example
2013-10-06 09:57:39	 *	Saizan [07:42:31] looks up what exponentiable morphism means
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[07:43:38] oh, makes sense
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[07:44:02] Saizan: the key is that every fibration is Conduché, so the non-Conduché example is also non-fibrant
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[07:45:48] *nod*
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[07:51:04] so i guess the functor 2 -> 3 which maps the arrow to the longest one is the example here http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Conduche+functor
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[07:59:22] oh, it's simply that the inverse image of the composition is 2, but the inverse image of each composite is empty
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[08:00:24] no, mixing levels
2013-10-06 09:57:39	 *	Saizan [08:00:43] will look at it when less tired
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[08:06:47] ok, sending 0 to a and 1 to c means the inverse of b is empty, and the pseudofunctor would need to build a functor from the terminal to the empty category
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[08:19:12] yep
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[08:24:49] so the arrow in 2 was a red herring
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[08:26:58] kind of, but for Conduché it has to exist anyway
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[08:27:14] for fibrant or opfibrant you can make a smaller counterexample
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[10:58:34] xplat: btw, is there a nice way to think of "cleavages" and "split fibrations" from the POV of inverse images?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[19:01:11] Saizan: well, they come from the 'cavilling about anafunctors' i had spoken about
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[19:05:44] Saizan: any fibration has an inverse image pseudofunctor into Cat^ana ; a cloven fibration has an inverse image pseudofunctor into Cat ; and a split fibration has an inverse image strict functor into Cat
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[19:07:08] Saizan: (for all but the last i can cite http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cleavage )
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xplat	[19:35:40] Saizan: (so in short a cleavage is a choice of representations for all the anafunctors you get in the canonical (property-like) inverse image that comes from the functor alone)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Saizan	[01:39:25] xplat: thanks!

2013-10-12 03:44:32	johnw	if Yoneda is f a ≅ ∀ b. (a → b) → f b, would higher-order Yoneda be f a ≅ (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a?
2013-10-12 03:47:05	Saizan	no
2013-10-12 03:47:31	johnw	does the latter have a name?
2013-10-12 03:48:19	Saizan	where does g come from there?
2013-10-12 03:48:34	johnw	it's supplied by the natural transformation
2013-10-12 03:48:59	johnw	fmap applies f : a -> b, nmap applies n : forall a. f a -> g a
2013-10-12 03:49:20	Saizan	that supplies values for g a
2013-10-12 03:49:27	johnw	so if I encode yoneda as \f -> fmap f xs, I would encode this other thing as \n -> nmap n xs
2013-10-12 03:49:39	johnw	it does?

2013-10-12 03:50:25	johnw	oh, I see
2013-10-12 03:50:57	Saizan	maybe you meant "f a ≅ ∀ g. (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a" ?
2013-10-12 03:51:17	johnw	it would be: f a ≅ ∀ g. Functor g => (f a → g a) → g a

2013-10-12 03:54:05	Saizan	Codensity, actually
2013-10-12 03:54:10	johnw	I was thinking it was Yoneda in the category of functors
2013-10-12 03:54:24	DT`	Saizan, that'd be ∀b. (f a → g b) → g b.
2013-10-12 03:54:52	DT`	IIRC Codensity is ∀b. (a → b) → b.
2013-10-12 03:55:37	tac	What does codensity actually mean?
2013-10-12 03:55:38	johnw	DT`: isn't that reversed?
2013-10-12 03:55:46	johnw	I thought Codensity was ∀b. (f a → g b) → g b
2013-10-12 03:55:50	Saizan	DT`: yeah, but from ∀b. (a → b) → b if you take a -> f, b -> g, and then introduce a new 'a' just to apply them to something
2013-10-12 03:55:58	johnw	tac: the word, or the construction?
2013-10-12 03:55:59	tac	Is codensity a real category theory thing? Or a Haskell-inspired thing?
2013-10-12 03:56:12	johnw	Codensity is a specialization of a left kan-extension, I believe
2013-10-12 03:56:14	tac	The construction. I have never heard of it outside of Haskell code snippets

2013-10-12 03:57:10	Saizan	well, i guess it's often called just Codensity, but DT`'s code is the version specialized to Idenitity
2013-10-12 03:57:30	Saizan	CodensityT f = Ran f f, a right kan extension
2013-10-12 03:57:36	johnw	thanks
2013-10-12 03:58:10	DT`	Saizan, so you mean (f :-> g) → g b, where :-> is a natural transformation?
2013-10-12 03:58:15	DT`	that's make sense.
2013-10-12 03:58:19	DT`	*that'd
2013-10-12 03:58:27	Saizan	DT`: yeah
2013-10-12 04:02:26	Saizan	Ran h j f = forall g. (f -> h g) -> j g, so we could take h = Identity, j = Identity, and if we are in the right category, assuming Rans exist, we should get it
2013-10-12 04:03:37	Saizan	so it would be "Yoneda Identity", in a higher category,  applied to f and a :), just not Yoneda f
2013-10-12 04:04:38	Saizan	the middle -> in Ran is a power
2013-10-12 04:06:02	Saizan	so we should check what that it means to take a power of a functor by a set
2013-10-12 04:11:19	johnw	would you guys mind looking at a short presentation draft, to see whether I'm not completely off the mark?  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/137615/Free%20Monads.pdf

2013-10-12 04:26:56	Saizan	same goes for forgetful, though that could be more of a pun?
2013-10-12 04:28:46	Saizan	slide 12,13 seems to try to hint at something but i'm not sure what
2013-10-12 04:36:01	Saizan	you should probably make nfoldr more general if you want to compare it to foldr

2013-10-12 04:44:05	Saizan	anyone i think one important part of the whole "free monads ~ free monoids" thing you have left out is the monoidal structure of the categories involved, which is different

2013-10-12 04:47:38	Saizan	also, i don't understand the [alpha1]x[alpha2] notation in slides 17 and similar, is it cartesian product? if so it doesn't seem right, also (++) doesn't combine lists of elements of different types

2013-10-12 05:52:11	Saizan	you'll need something to connect pure and (<*>) though
2013-10-12 05:52:19	Eduard_Munteanu	Yeah, I know there's a different definition usually, though I don't remember much of it.

2013-10-12 06:01:28	Eduard_Munteanu	Also, on a sidenote, edwardk mentioned there are no coapplicatives on Hask because there are no coexponentials. I guess (co)monads are independent of (co)applicatives, in the general case.

2013-10-12 06:03:50	DT`	Eduard_Munteanu, applicatives are strictly speaking closed functors ( http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/closed+functor ) which preserve exponentials as you say.
2013-10-12 06:04:13	DT`	(if you check the laws of applicative they map perfectly to a closed functor's)
2013-10-12 06:04:25	Saizan	you often want an extra liftW2, but it's not given
2013-10-12 06:04:40	DT`	they're equivalent to lax monoidal functors if your category is closed monoidal and maybe something else.
2013-10-12 06:04:48	DT`	which Hask is, btw.
2013-10-12 06:05:52	Eduard_Munteanu	Hm. Yeah, I also forgot to say I probably want a continuous functor, so I'm probably assuming too much from Hask when I'm saying "just preserve exponentials".

2013-10-12 06:24:46	DT`	Eduard_Munteanu, I don't know about continuity, but for that what you need is a closed monoidal functor, then (preserves products and exponentials), though that's already more than Applicative, since it fails for [].
2013-10-12 06:26:39	Eduard_Munteanu	DT`: hm, it does? Well, I suppose it doesn't preserve co-structure.
2013-10-12 06:27:22	Eduard_Munteanu	(though it probably preserves coexponentials vacuously, considering there aren't any?)

2013-10-12 06:30:15	DT`	?
2013-10-12 06:31:15	Eduard_Munteanu	Err, I was thinking of 'List a = 1 + a x List a'.
2013-10-12 06:31:35	DT`	oh.
2013-10-12 06:31:48	DT`	well, I'm not sure that's the problem.
2013-10-12 06:32:38	DT`	because the *other* [] instance of Applicative of lists should satisfy that.
2013-10-12 06:32:42	Eduard_Munteanu	I guess you'd get the same problem for infinite streams (though one could argue Hask only has finite limits).

2013-10-13 03:00:04	Saizan	"the nerve of a category is a simplicial set" seems a good starting point

2013-10-13 03:18:01	Saizan	ah
2013-10-13 03:18:06	xplat	and first you have to figure out what the appropriate (\infty,1)-category of simplicial sets is, i think you do it by localizing the 1-category structure they have as presheaves on a particular model structure

2013-10-15 11:12:37	roconnor_	[04:34:39] What extra laws would I expect a well-behaved adjunction between two monoidal categories to have?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[04:45:50] did you see http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+adjunction?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	roconnor_	[05:50:24] no I didn't find that.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	roconnor_	[05:50:26] Thanks!
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[01:23:45] Monoidal categories
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[01:23:49] Their coherence laws....
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[01:24:51] Could you take MacLane's coherence theorem as the definition of the laws?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[01:24:56] And then derive the pentagram from there?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[08:05:53] @tell tac you could kind of take MacLane's coherence theorem as the definition of monoidal categories, but how well it works depends which statement of the coherence theorem you use
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lambdabot	[08:05:53] Consider it noted.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[13:44:59] is the free monoid an initial object in the category of monoid algebras?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[14:03:05] What category is that?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[14:03:35] by monoid algebras you mean the T-algebras for the list monad?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[14:05:23] anyhow the free monoid generated by A (i.e. lists with elements in A) is initial in the category of monoids with a function from A
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[14:35:22] I was thinking of the category of F-algebras which have monoid structure, but it's possible my question doesn't make sense as asked
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[14:42:00] What category is that?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[14:45:01] yeah, you should spell out more what the objects and the morphisms look like in what you're imagining
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[14:45:55] Well, just specifying the morphisms is enough. :-)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[14:47:41] I guess strictly speaking it isn't enough. Specifying the composition operation is enough.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[14:57:24] ok
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:44:32] if Yoneda is f a ≅ ∀ b. (a → b) → f b, would higher-order Yoneda be f a ≅ (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:47:05] no
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:47:31] does the latter have a name?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:48:19] where does g come from there?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:48:34] it's supplied by the natural transformation
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:48:59] fmap applies f : a -> b, nmap applies n : forall a. f a -> g a
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:49:20] that supplies values for g a
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:49:27] so if I encode yoneda as \f -> fmap f xs, I would encode this other thing as \n -> nmap n xs
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:49:39] it does?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:50:07] i'm asking in Yoneda be f a ≅ (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a where is the variable 'g' supposed to be bound
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:50:25] oh, I see
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:50:57] maybe you meant "f a ≅ ∀ g. (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a" ?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:51:17] it would be: f a ≅ ∀ g. Functor g => (f a → g a) → g a
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:51:48] or f a ≅ ∀ g. Functor g => (∀ b. f b → g b) → g a
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:51:49] yeah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:53:02] that feels like an higher order version of Cont
2013-10-15 11:12:37	benmachine	[03:53:58] maybe it's just Yoneda but in a different category
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:54:05] Codensity, actually
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:54:10] I was thinking it was Yoneda in the category of functors
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[03:54:24] Saizan, that'd be ∀b. (f a → g b) → g b.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[03:54:52] IIRC Codensity is ∀b. (a → b) → b.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[03:55:37] What does codensity actually mean?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:55:38] DT`: isn't that reversed?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:55:46] I thought Codensity was ∀b. (f a → g b) → g b
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:55:50] DT`: yeah, but from ∀b. (a → b) → b if you take a -> f, b -> g, and then introduce a new 'a' just to apply them to something
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:55:58] tac: the word, or the construction?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[03:55:59] Is codensity a real category theory thing? Or a Haskell-inspired thing?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:56:12] Codensity is a specialization of a left kan-extension, I believe
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[03:56:14] The construction. I have never heard of it outside of Haskell code snippets
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:56:15] johnw: CodensityT f a = ∀b. (a → f b) → f b
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:56:23] ah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:57:10] well, i guess it's often called just Codensity, but DT`'s code is the version specialized to Idenitity
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:57:30] CodensityT f = Ran f f, a right kan extension
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[03:57:36] thanks
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[03:58:10] Saizan, so you mean (f :-> g) → g b, where :-> is a natural transformation?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[03:58:15] that's make sense.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[03:58:19] *that'd
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:58:27] DT`: yeah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:02:26] Ran h j f = forall g. (f -> h g) -> j g, so we could take h = Identity, j = Identity, and if we are in the right category, assuming Rans exist, we should get it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:03:37] so it would be "Yoneda Identity", in a higher category,  applied to f and a :), just not Yoneda f
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:04:38] the middle -> in Ran is a power
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:06:02] so we should check what that it means to take a power of a functor by a set
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[04:11:19] would you guys mind looking at a short presentation draft, to see whether I'm not completely off the mark?  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/137615/Free%20Monads.pdf
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[04:11:48] i'll be back in a couple hours, will check scrollback for comments
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:24:01] slide 9, join : f . f -> f
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:25:02] you're using algebra where i would say algebraic structure
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:25:46] also because algebra has already two, even if closer, technical meaning in this context
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:26:56] same goes for forgetful, though that could be more of a pun?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:28:46] slide 12,13 seems to try to hint at something but i'm not sure what
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:36:01] you should probably make nfoldr more general if you want to compare it to foldr
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:40:13] the representation of free monad values and the result of nfoldr in slide 21 doesn't make much sense to me, what does the comma stand for?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:42:08] as we said slide 25 is incorrect
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:44:05] anyone i think one important part of the whole "free monads ~ free monoids" thing you have left out is the monoidal structure of the categories involved, which is different
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:44:38] well, you had to use it, but you didn't spell it out
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:45:04] i.e. that in Hask you're using the product while in Endo(Hask) you are using composition
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:47:38] also, i don't understand the [alpha1]x[alpha2] notation in slides 17 and similar, is it cartesian product? if so it doesn't seem right, also (++) doesn't combine lists of elements of different types
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[04:55:36] ah, since you've used lists on slide 17 you shold use elements of the free monad in slide 19, then join is not going to be id
2013-10-15 11:12:37	 *	shachaf [05:19:08] doesn't really understand these slides.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	tac	[05:20:54] Which slides are these?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[05:25:52] Linked half a page ago.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	dibblego	[05:27:13] johnw: what is the audience?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:45:38] Can I describe applicative functors as pointed, exponential-preserving functors? Anything more I'd need?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:45:47] :t (<*>)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lambdabot	[05:45:48] Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:46:51] That'd be f (b^a) = (f b) ^ (f a).
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:50:36] It also needs to map eval to eval.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:50:59] :t fmap (uncurry ($))
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lambdabot	[05:51:00] Functor f => f (b1 -> b, b1) -> f b
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[05:51:38] they are more often defined in terms of products as lax monoidal functors, but maybe yours works too if you assume exponentials
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[05:52:11] you'll need something to connect pure and (<*>) though
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:52:19] Yeah, I know there's a different definition usually, though I don't remember much of it.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[05:53:19] the Idioms paper has it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:53:24] Saizan: I think that's part of the exponential definition... just the lifting of  eval o (uncurry x id) = id
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:54:17] Saizan: the lax monoidal one?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[05:54:24] yeah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:55:04] edwardk said somebody came up with a closed functor definition, but I'm unsure if that's needed.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[05:56:46] ah, interesting
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:01:28] Also, on a sidenote, edwardk mentioned there are no coapplicatives on Hask because there are no coexponentials. I guess (co)monads are independent of (co)applicatives, in the general case.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:01:49] (Because we certianly have comonads on Hask.)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[06:02:57] a comonad gives you an applicative too
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:03:28] Oh, hm. I thought it'd just give a Copointed.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[06:03:37] Saizan: It does?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[06:03:49] mh, wait, it doesn't
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:03:50] Eduard_Munteanu, applicatives are strictly speaking closed functors ( http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/closed+functor ) which preserve exponentials as you say.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:04:13] (if you check the laws of applicative they map perfectly to a closed functor's)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[06:04:25] you often want an extra liftW2, but it's not given
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:04:40] they're equivalent to lax monoidal functors if your category is closed monoidal and maybe something else.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:04:48] which Hask is, btw.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:05:52] Hm. Yeah, I also forgot to say I probably want a continuous functor, so I'm probably assuming too much from Hask when I'm saying "just preserve exponentials".
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:06:42] :t (fmap (uncurry ($)), (<*>)) -- should be isomorphic at least
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lambdabot	[06:06:42] (Functor f, Applicative f1) => (f (b1 -> b, b1) -> f b, f1 (a -> b2) -> f1 a -> f1 b2)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:24:46] Eduard_Munteanu, I don't know about continuity, but for that what you need is a closed monoidal functor, then (preserves products and exponentials), though that's already more than Applicative, since it fails for [].
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:26:39] DT`: hm, it does? Well, I suppose it doesn't preserve co-structure.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:27:22] (though it probably preserves coexponentials vacuously, considering there aren't any?)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:28:31] Eduard_Munteanu, map (uncurry ($)) [((+1),2),((+2),3)] = [3,5] != [(+1),(+2)] <*> [2,3] = [3,4,4,5].
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:29:53] because [(a,b)] is not iso to ([a],[b]).
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:29:55] DT`: that looks like it works with the product-ish bits but not the coproduct-ish ones.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:30:15] ?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:31:15] Err, I was thinking of 'List a = 1 + a x List a'.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:31:35] oh.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:31:48] well, I'm not sure that's the problem.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:32:38] because the *other* [] instance of Applicative of lists should satisfy that.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:32:42] I guess you'd get the same problem for infinite streams (though one could argue Hask only has finite limits).
2013-10-15 11:12:37	DT`	[06:32:42] the ziplist one.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:32:52] Oh, right.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Eduard_Munteanu	[06:33:40] Yeah, that's pretty much products.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[07:38:07] Saizan: thank you for your comments, I'll integrate them
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[07:38:18] dibblego: just a discussion among co-workers
2013-10-15 11:12:37	johnw	[07:38:32] shachaf: saying what you don't understand would help
2013-10-15 11:12:37	benmachine	[07:54:33] johnw: I don't understand the notation of slide #5
2013-10-15 11:12:37	benmachine	[07:54:56] or the two that follow it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	shachaf	[07:55:49] Well, start with the things that Saizan and benmachine said. :-)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[02:02:19] a comonad does give you an applicative because it gives you an arrow; unlike monads, though, they don't give you an applicative on *the same functor*
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[02:06:54] Reader (w r) ?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[02:13:40] i think
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[02:15:34] also, you should be able to get one with the r bound, but i'm not sure if existentially or universally
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[02:34:00] what's a good read on how simplicial sets are related to groupoids?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:00:04] "the nerve of a category is a simplicial set" seems a good starting point
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[03:12:58] there's been some work on generalized nerve theorems, i'm not closely familiar with it yet
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[03:13:33] i think the relation of simplicial sets to groupoids is a bit different though, if you mean like \infty-groupoids
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[03:16:11] there it's a case where the (\infty,1)-categories of \infty-groupoids and of simplicial sets are (\infty,1)-equivalent
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:18:01] ah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[03:18:06] and first you have to figure out what the appropriate (\infty,1)-category of simplicial sets is, i think you do it by localizing the 1-category structure they have as presheaves on a particular model structure
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[03:57:27] even just knowing how to turn a \infty-groupoid into a simplicial set and vice-versa would be great
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[04:54:30] Saizan: you can turn a simplicial set into an \infty-groupoid by taking its geometric realization and then the homotopy \infty-groupoid of the resulting space, but there might be a more direct way
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[07:36:05] xplat: and that is invertable? nice
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[07:38:33] somewhat invertable-ish.  there's the 'singular complex' that inverts the geometric realization up to something-or-other, and i think there's a way to get a space from an \infty-groupoid too
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[11:26:43] is the category(groupoid?) you get from {0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3} associated with a tetrahedron because that's what you get if you arrange the 6 morphisms so that they don't intersect?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Cale	[18:11:22] Saizan: yeah, just draw in all the composites
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[20:26:34] Saizan: that's the simplex category for a tetrahedron and its nerve is an actual tetrahedron (as a simplicial set)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	xplat	[20:27:50] up to throwing away degenerate simplices with id as one of their edges, anyway
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[20:29:44] what do you mean by "actual tetrahedron"?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Saizan	[20:32:55] i guess the face maps will match what you'd expect out of a tetrahedron

2013-10-16 14:30:07	jgross	Do all functions in STLC (simply typed lambda calculus) extend to functors?  If not, what's a counter-example?
2013-10-16 14:31:13	Saizan	you mean like by interpreting them in Cat?
2013-10-16 14:31:38	jgross	Yes.
2013-10-16 14:32:34	Saizan	it'd think so, since functors make Cat a CCC, right?
2013-10-16 14:34:57	Saizan	thinking of using that to be able to define functors pointwise?
2013-10-16 14:36:36	jgross	What do you mean by "define functors pointwise"?
2013-10-16 14:38:03	Saizan	mostly just using lambda calculus syntax to compose them rather than more awkward combinators, in a formalized settings
2013-10-16 14:39:10	jgross	I might try to abuse Coq's notation to make a DSL where terms get interpreted as functors.  Or I might try to prototype it in idris or agda if I can't get Coq's notation to do what I want.  I want to be able to just write standard Coq (or agda or whatever) code and get it to extend to functors when it can.  Because I feel like all of my constructions of things are functorial, and I want to see how far I can push this, and it will be much nicer
2013-10-16 14:39:10	jgross	if I can get a lot of it for free.
2013-10-16 14:39:18	jgross	Does Cat have W-types?	Or does something like Cat have W-types?
2013-10-16 14:42:53	jgross	(Also, my exponential laws are slow, so I want to derive them from the type-level versions, and then prove equality of composition by proving that the underlying STLC terms are equal, rather than going through nested functor equalities.)
2013-10-16 14:44:55	Saizan	very interesting
2013-10-16 14:45:28	Saizan	is Cat complete and cocomplete? if so we might be able to port generalised polynomials there
2013-10-16 14:47:03	jgross	What are generalized polynomials?
2013-10-16 14:49:14	jgross	/What are genneralized polynomials used for?
2013-10-16 14:49:51	Saizan	well, as polynomials are used to describe the functor you take a fixpoint of to get an indexed W type
2013-10-16 14:50:23	jgross	Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_category) says Cat is bicomplete (complete + cocomplete)
2013-10-16 14:50:45	Saizan	generalised polynomials are for doing the same but getting a presheaf rather than an element of a slice category
2013-10-16 14:51:11	jgross	What characterizes when fixed points exist?
2013-10-16 14:52:44	Saizan	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/papers/Algebra/gpf.pdf <- this paper has some sufficient conditions about that
2013-10-16 14:54:12	Saizan	nice, if it's bicomplete we get the necessary kan extensions to produce functors into Cat rather than presheaves i'd think
2013-10-16 14:55:42	jgross	Maybe I'll try to formalize the completeness and cocompleteness soonish.  (I've heard that proving that it's cocomplete is hard.)  But I should sleep now.  Goodnight.

2013-10-16 17:05:02	ciaranm	i'd suggest awodey
2013-10-16 17:05:41	echo-area	What's awodey?
2013-10-16 17:07:01	echo-area	Oh, Category Theory by Steve Awodey
2013-10-16 17:07:38	echo-area	What're the differences and relations between category theory and programming language theory, BTW?
2013-10-16 17:11:06	ciaranm	you can think of category theory as a theory of theories about things that behave sort of like functions
2013-10-16 17:11:28	ciaranm	if you're used to thinking of programming languages in terms of set theory, you'll realise set theory isn't really "right"
2013-10-16 17:11:44	ciaranm	e.g. set theory doesn't (on the surface of it) give you a way of describing functions with effects
2013-10-16 17:11:50	ciaranm	or functions that might not terminate

2013-10-16 17:17:36	echo-area	Does learning one of them help learning the other?
2013-10-16 17:18:26	echo-area	In fact I need suggestions on what to learn if I'm interested in programming language design
2013-10-16 17:19:42	ciaranm	knowing some category theory will help you understand what the functional programming crowd are really on about
2013-10-16 17:19:42	ciaranm	knowing about programming languages won't really help you understand most of the category theory literature, since mathematicians prefer to take their examples from algebra, topology and logic
2013-10-16 17:20:50	echo-area	Does it mean that I can't understand category theory if I have forgotten the related algebra, or have no knowledge about topology?
2013-10-16 17:21:23	ciaranm	you won't appreciate many of the examples
2013-10-16 17:21:37	ciaranm	category theory itself has no real prerequisites
2013-10-16 17:25:24	echo-area	I see.  But I have started reading the PL theory book, and I do this only in my spare time.  Constructing proves that have been omitted by the author takes a long time so that I don't think I can finish that book shortly.  Do you think if I should suspend it and instead read something about category theory, if I may ask?
2013-10-16 17:26:45	Saizan	echo-area: maybe filling in every proof is not the right way to read it
2013-10-16 17:27:19	Saizan	echo-area: sometimes it's better to go through it a little less in-depth to get the big picture at least, and maybe revisit later
2013-10-16 17:28:00	echo-area	Got it.  That will be faster
2013-10-16 17:28:12	Saizan	anyhow, among the introductions on category theory you find some that use quite accessible examples even you're not a mathematicians
2013-10-16 17:28:57	ciaranm	to be honest, i'd suggest that a decent knowledge of algebra would help you with programming languages anyway...
2013-10-16 17:29:15	ciaranm	you probably want to know about free groups, for example
2013-10-16 17:31:21	echo-area	Is there something like a read list?  I have not touched serious math for years, though I have functional programming background
2013-10-16 17:32:19	ciaranm	i don't know of a good undergrad-level algebra textbook. "visual group theory" is ok, but doesn't cover what you really want.
2013-10-16 17:32:57	ciaranm	"algebra chapter 0" is very nice and category-theory-centric, but it's probably aimed at where you want to be, rather than where you are
2013-10-16 17:43:15	echo-area	How about first "visual group theory" then "algebra chapter 0"?
2013-10-16 17:47:42	ciaranm	there's still a big gap
2013-10-16 17:47:50	ciaranm	"visual group theory" only covers a little bit of algebra
2013-10-16 17:51:15	echo-area	How about this one: Algebra and number theory by A. Baker
2013-10-16 17:51:23	echo-area	Does it fill the gap?
2013-10-16 17:52:41	ciaranm	is that a book? it looks like a combination of notes from two of the courses he taught
2013-10-16 17:54:10	ciaranm	i had fraleigh inflicted upon me as an undergrad. it's an awful book.
2013-10-16 17:55:18	echo-area	Abstract algebra?
2013-10-16 17:56:05	ciaranm	yeah. you can tell it's crap because it calls it "abstract"
2013-10-16 17:56:12	ciaranm	also because it has eleventy editions

2013-10-17 08:37:30	jgross	(Sorry, I disappeared for a while).  johnw: For example, if you gave it (C -> (D -> C)), it would construct the functor that sends each object c of a category C to the functor F in the functor category D^C which sends every object of D to the object c.  I think that you can do this for any term in the lambda calculus, and possibly more, though I'm not sure quite how far you can go.

2013-10-30 21:23:37	DT`	what do category theorists do with "invariant functors" like Endo : C → Set; Endo(X) = Hom(X,X)? saying that it should be a functor from C^op × C is too general, since then Endo would just be Hom, so there should be a restriction on the object part that I don't know how to express "purely" category theoretically.
2013-10-30 21:31:33	DT`	I think the question I actually want to ask is, are these kind of "functors" somewhere inside Cat?

2013-11-02 23:02:46	Eduard_Munteanu	What's an invariant functor really? C^op x D -> E ?
2013-11-02 23:15:46	DT`	Saizan, |C| → D would lose too much information, I think, and Hom(A,B) = C(A,B)×C(B,A) works but it doesn't feel "purely category theoretic" enough, but maybe that's just me. (sorry, I missed your message before)
2013-11-02 23:16:12	DT`	xplat_, I think core(C) → D would have the same problems as |C| → D.
2013-11-02 23:16:27	Saizan	whats core(C)?
2013-11-02 23:16:47	DT`	the groupoid of isomorphisms of C.
2013-11-02 23:21:11	xplat_	DT`: what information would core(C) -> D lose?
2013-11-02 23:26:40	DT`	xplat_, if f : A → B and g : B → A are morphisms in C, do you get a morphism F(A) → F(B) in D from F : core(C) → D? I'm not sure about this since f and g might not form an isomorphism, F is required only to respect isomorphisms of C, and different categories can have the same core.
2013-11-02 23:33:49	xplat_	DT`: ah, i see what you mean, but usually the interesting structure you get on something like Endo(-) over Hom(-,-) doesn't respect arbitrary pairs of morphisms
2013-11-02 23:34:04	xplat_	DT`: e.g. the monoidal structure on Endo(-) from composition of functors

2013-11-09 14:46:26	rola	in lawvere & rosebrugh's sets for mathematics, it says "We can repeat the characteristic feature of every f : A → B as follows, ∀a : 1 → A ∃! b : 1 → B [b is a value of f at a]. But this is a special case of the fact that composition in general is uniquely deﬁned."
2013-11-09 14:47:24	rola	what does it mean that composition in general is uniquely defined?
2013-11-09 14:52:44	rola	"a composition of mappings, i.e., given any pair f : A → B, g: B → C, there is a speciﬁed way of combining them to give a resulting mapping gf"
2013-11-09 14:53:51	rola	does the "specified way" mean unique?

2013-11-13 05:32:02	shachaf	I think that phrasing is fine. At least, it communicates more information than "natural numbers and matrices", which doesn't actually specify what composition is.
2013-11-13 05:32:09	Iceland_jack	You still wouldn't call e.g. Set a category formed by function composition :)
2013-11-13 05:32:45	Iceland_jack	well maybe someone would

2013-11-14 06:04:09	augur	so category theory is all about structuralism, in some sense -- we only care about the structure of objects as defined by their relationships to other objects, and any other distinguishing characteristics are non-kosher
2013-11-14 06:05:09	tac	Is that not true of every field of mathematics?
2013-11-14 06:05:12	augur	what other techniques/systems are there for that sort of structuralism -- where its the externational "relational" structure that identifies something -- either within math or outside of math?
2013-11-14 06:05:21	tac	In euclidean geometry, all you care about are points and their relationships via lines
2013-11-14 06:05:22	augur	tac: well yes and not but CT really pushes it home :p
2013-11-14 06:05:33	tac	That's not a very rigorous claim :P
2013-11-14 06:05:41	augur	its not meant to be rigorous
2013-11-14 06:05:55	tac	Well, it doesn't have much content, I guess
2013-11-14 06:06:06	augur	its meant to tickle your CT lobe into recalling something you almost certainly read somewhere
2013-11-14 06:06:21	augur	rigor is for people who dont already know what you're talking about

2013-11-14 06:06:56	tac	I decided to purchase two books on differential geometry this morning. One is handwavy and full of pictures
2013-11-14 06:07:04	engimo	which
2013-11-14 06:07:05	tac	the other seems like it would do a good job concretizing it
2013-11-14 06:07:18	augur	tac: thanks for derailing my question tho :(
2013-11-14 06:07:18	tac	Spivak and Tu.
2013-11-14 06:07:34	augur	ahh Spivak, the Vulcan geometer
2013-11-14 06:07:36	tac	augur: I didn't see any question marks
2013-11-14 06:07:50	augur	tac: see my second sentence then :P
2013-11-14 06:07:58	tac	ah
2013-11-14 06:08:29	engimo	those are both good books
2013-11-14 06:08:34	tac	http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Manifolds-Universitext-Loring/dp/1441973990/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384380499&sr=8-1&keywords=geometry+tu
2013-11-14 06:08:54	tac	That one, in particular, I'm very excited for. It has beautiful typesetting, too.
2013-11-14 06:08:55	engimo	after you read those, you should read bott & tu
2013-11-14 06:09:16	tac	Link?
2013-11-14 06:09:38	engimo	if you google bott and tu it should be obvious
2013-11-14 06:09:41	augur	awkward that when i google for 'structuralism "formal language"', one of the top results is my own blog >_>
2013-11-14 06:10:38	tac	Doesn't that seem only logical, augur? You search for what you're interested and you write about what you're interested in.
2013-11-14 06:10:57	augur	tac: yes, but that my blog is one of the top results is awkward
2013-11-14 06:10:58	tac	Solution: Be like me, and never get around to blogging.
2013-11-14 06:11:12	tac	It used to be you could remove results from Google searches
2013-11-14 06:11:23	tac	but they changed that a while ago. (And it's obnoxious as a PHP programmer.....)
2013-11-14 06:11:41	augur	because it means a) im one of the few people interested in those things (im not famous or anything), and b) anyone here who might think "oh i think maybe theres something, lemme google" will find me griping about junk
2013-11-14 06:11:54	augur	actually in this case i wasnt griping, and it wasnt relevant, but... :p
2013-11-14 06:12:28	tac	engimo: this guy, I take it? http://www.amazon.com/Differential-Algebraic-Topology-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387906134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384380735&sr=8-1&keywords=geometry+tu+bott
2013-11-14 06:12:56	tac	This one looks much much harder :X
2013-11-14 06:14:33	FireFly	augur: or c) Google is serving you targeted results
2013-11-14 06:14:54	augur	FireFly: :p
2013-11-14 06:15:03	augur	why would it serve me my own site as a targeted result!

2013-11-14 07:05:30	pedro3005	but thinking about coproducts of sets, of groups, of pointed spaces...
2013-11-14 07:05:55	pedro3005	I have a suspicion that Aut (G_1 * G_2) = Aut G_1 x Aut G_2, where G_1, G_2 are groups and * their coproduct
2013-11-14 07:10:12	tac	and x is the product?
2013-11-14 07:11:31	pedro3005	yes
2013-11-14 07:13:01	tac	I'm not sure that holds
2013-11-14 07:13:07	tac	Z_2, the group of order 2
2013-11-14 07:13:16	tac	Z_2 * Z_2 is iso to Z_3
2013-11-14 07:13:26	pedro3005	??
2013-11-14 07:13:39	tac	The coproduct of Z_2 and Z_3 has three elements.
2013-11-14 07:14:06	tac	the identity 0, a copy of 1 we get from the left and a copy of 1 we get from the right.
2013-11-14 07:14:13	pedro3005	as far as I know the coproduct Z_2 * Z_3 is infinite
2013-11-14 07:14:20	tac	Err
2013-11-14 07:14:41	tac	You might be right there.
2013-11-14 07:14:54	pedro3005	well, Hungerford agrees :p
2013-11-14 07:15:11	pedro3005	Z_2 * Z_3 = <a, b | a^2 = b^3 = 1>
2013-11-14 07:17:31	tac	Oops, I even mistyped it
2013-11-14 07:17:36	tac	Z_2 * Z_2 is what I meant to write
2013-11-14 07:17:47	tac	Anyway, that gives us a group iso to Z... I think maybe?
2013-11-14 07:18:15	tac	and Aut(Z_2) = Z_2, yeah?
2013-11-14 07:18:36	pedro3005	I think Aut(Z_2) is the trivial group
2013-11-14 07:18:44	tac	ack
2013-11-14 07:18:51	tac	I not only typed it wrong, I wrote it out wrong :<
2013-11-14 07:19:05	tac	But that still serves as a counter example
2013-11-14 07:19:27	tac	Aut(Z_2 * Z_2) is infinite and Z_2 x Z_2 is very much not
2013-11-14 07:19:31	tac	err
2013-11-14 07:19:38	tac	Aut(Z_2) x Aut(Z_2)
2013-11-14 07:19:57	pedro3005	how do you know that Aut(Z_2 * Z_2) is.. oh wait
2013-11-14 07:20:17	tac	I think (now that you mention it's infinite) that Z_2 * Z_2 should be iso to just Z
2013-11-14 07:20:30	pedro3005	I don't think so
2013-11-14 07:20:39	pedro3005	Z_2 * Z_2 is nonabelian, I believe
2013-11-14 07:20:46	tac	ack
2013-11-14 07:20:49	tac	you're right again
2013-11-14 07:21:08	pedro3005	but its automorphism group is not trivial
2013-11-14 07:21:26	pedro3005	I don't know how you know it's infinite, but it can't be trivial
2013-11-14 07:26:37	pedro3005	tac, though I still think maybe there is an injective homomorphism Aut G_1 x Aut G_2 -> Aut (G_1 * G_2) :p
2013-11-14 07:27:26	pedro3005	wait, that's not interesting
2013-11-14 07:28:17	tac	This problem is very interesting

2013-11-14 07:28:30	tac	because it highlights how much I need to practice groups :X
2013-11-14 07:32:58	tac	And I'm upgrading my educated guess, Aut(Z_2 * Z_2) seems to have two elements, right?

2013-11-14 07:33:45	pedro3005	I think so

2013-11-14 07:37:13	pedro3005	tac, there's a nice argument that shows that any group which is not trivial and not Z_2 has a nonidentity automorphism

2013-11-14 07:42:45	tac	rats, I was trying to work out the proof
2013-11-14 07:42:54	tac	and that was my first thought :P
2013-11-14 07:43:02	pedro3005	if G is abelian with an element of order > 2, then x |-> x^-1 is a nonidentity automorphism
2013-11-14 07:43:30	pedro3005	if G is abelian and every non-identity element has order 2, it forms a vector space over Z_2. take a basis and permute
2013-11-14 07:44:19	Cale	oh, right, that's not what I wanted to even try computing
2013-11-14 07:44:21	pedro3005	Cale, how about the size of the aut of that
2013-11-14 07:44:24	Cale	right
2013-11-14 07:44:31	pedro3005	it's clear that Z_2 * Z_2 is infinite :P

2013-11-14 07:44:56	Cale	(though it would be nice if GAP could *tell* that it's infinite

2013-11-14 07:45:15	Cale	I get the same sort of result trying AutomorphismGroup of that
2013-11-14 07:45:58	pedro3005	does that mean |Aut (Z_2 * Z_2)| is large, provably?
2013-11-14 07:46:05	Cale	I don't actually know
2013-11-14 07:46:14	Cale	Probably doesn't imply much
2013-11-14 07:47:40	pedro3005	hm..
2013-11-14 07:47:49	pedro3005	can you think of another automorphism?
2013-11-14 07:48:28	pedro3005	because Z_2 * Z_2 = <a, b | a^2 = b^2 = 1>. I think the only elements of order 2 are a, b
2013-11-14 07:48:34	pedro3005	so the best you can do is swap them
2013-11-14 07:48:58	Cale	Yeah, it would make sense that it's just the swap
2013-11-14 07:49:11	Cale	hmm

2013-11-14 07:59:09	tac	I think I need a nap or something.
2013-11-14 07:59:19	Cale	(The free product of groups is always infinite unless one of the groups is trivial)
2013-11-14 08:00:03	pedro3005	well yes
2013-11-14 08:00:15	pedro3005	but a group can be infinite and still have every element of order 2, can't it
2013-11-14 08:00:23	tac	right
2013-11-14 08:00:28	tac	but in this case, that's not so
2013-11-14 08:00:30	pedro3005	yes
2013-11-14 08:00:39	tac	and the neat little lemma you gave doesn't specify all the automorphisms :(
2013-11-14 08:01:01	pedro3005	well, computing automorphism groups is hard in general
2013-11-14 08:01:39	pedro3005	but i'm 90% sure
2013-11-14 08:01:41	tac	still, if you map a to something other than a or b, I think you run into trouble.
2013-11-14 08:01:54	pedro3005	yeah, because every other element has infinite order
2013-11-14 08:02:37	tac	so unless φ(a) or φ(b) is equal to a, you can't "get back down to a"
2013-11-14 08:02:50	tac	hmm

2013-11-14 08:03:05	tac	I need to stop talking without some sleep :P
2013-11-14 08:03:30	pedro3005	phi(a) will need to be a b something or b a something
2013-11-14 08:03:40	pedro3005	either way it's easy to see that it has infinite order
2013-11-14 08:03:43	pedro3005	but automorphisms preserve order
2013-11-14 08:04:16	tac	The automorphisms also have to preserve the relations of the presentation
2013-11-14 08:04:36	tac	So φ(a) has to be an order-2 element

2013-11-14 08:05:25	pedro3005	oh wait
2013-11-14 08:05:29	pedro3005	good point
2013-11-14 08:05:39	pedro3005	aba has order 2
2013-11-14 08:05:49	pedro3005	shit
2013-11-14 08:06:41	pedro3005	ok, this might be non-trivial
2013-11-14 08:07:53	tac	so hmm
2013-11-14 08:08:09	tac	Assume neither a or b maps to a
2013-11-14 08:09:07	tac	then φ(x) = a is either φ(aba...ba) = a or φ(bab...ab) = a
2013-11-14 08:10:06	tac	err I missed some cases, and my approach sucks
2013-11-14 08:11:25	pedro3005	i think if you look at all the cases maybe it works
2013-11-14 08:11:41	pedro3005	but now i'm not totally convinced there isn't another automorphism
2013-11-14 08:17:02	tac	How about this
2013-11-14 08:17:22	tac	We know φ(a) is order-2 and so is φ(b)
2013-11-14 08:17:36	tac	Moreover, we can't have φ(a) and φ(b) start with the same generator
2013-11-14 08:17:55	pedro3005	why?
2013-11-14 08:18:00	tac	If they did, and φ(a) = aba...ba and φ(b) = aba.....ba

2013-11-14 08:18:09	tac	almost
2013-11-14 08:20:45	pedro3005	tac, a |-> bab and b |-> b
2013-11-14 08:22:42	tac	yep
2013-11-14 08:27:20	tac	Looks like a new automorphism to me
2013-11-14 08:27:37	tac	Plus, it's an involution :)
2013-11-14 08:27:54	tac	I wonder if all the automorphisms are involutions for this group

2013-11-15 16:30:46	shachaf	So the usual definition of a category lets you compose any finite path into an arrow.
2013-11-15 16:31:28	shachaf	What if you also allow infinite paths? Is that a thing? Does it make sense?
2013-11-15 16:33:59	mr-	shachaf: You can make sense of it. Take the colimit over the diagram you want to compose.

2013-11-15 16:34:52	mr-	(That makes a lot of sense when you have a final object in the diagram and you set the colimit to be that object)
2013-11-15 16:35:10	shachaf	Hmm, that's not really composition, is it?
2013-11-15 16:36:26	mr-	In the special case of having a final object, I think it makes sense to call it the composition
2013-11-15 16:36:53	mr-	But that's an answer internal to CT.. I am sure you were looking for something else
2013-11-15 16:37:55	shachaf	Well, if you take a finite case does it work out to be the same as the composition?
2013-11-15 16:38:37	mr-	Of course
2013-11-15 16:38:42	shachaf	I'm not really sure what that means.
2013-11-15 16:39:35	shachaf	I have a sequence of arrows that match. You're suggesting taking the colimit of A --f--> B --g--> C to find g . f?
2013-11-15 16:40:18	mr-	Well, the colimit with its map from A
2013-11-15 16:42:38	shachaf	Oh, I see. Because if your diagram has a terminal object the colimit ('s object) will always be that.
2013-11-15 16:42:39	mr-	A -> colim(A->B->C) = C with the map being the composition (by definition and the _choice_ of colim to be C)
2013-11-15 16:42:52	mr-	Yes, sorry. I should have mentioned that.
2013-11-15 16:44:14	shachaf	So some categories always let you do that.
2013-11-15 16:44:43	shachaf	I guess that's a generalization of ω-cpos.
2013-11-15 16:46:41	mr-	It's funny you should ask that question. It's the exact same question a student asked in class yesterday. :-)
2013-11-15 16:50:03	shachaf	Maybe I should take a class so I can ask lots of questions.
2013-11-15 16:58:56	arkeet	why not take a limit?
2013-11-15 16:59:01	arkeet	this seems awfully asymmetric.
2013-11-15 16:59:24	arkeet	lim (A -> B -> C) is A with some maps to B and C.
2013-11-15 16:59:24	shachaf	I was wondering about that.
2013-11-15 16:59:50	shachaf	Well, the poset category of natural numbers has an initial object and no terminal object.
2013-11-15 16:59:50	tomprince	Sure.
2013-11-15 17:00:12	arkeet	well
2013-11-15 17:00:15	arkeet	if you like your paths to have endpoints
2013-11-15 17:00:24	arkeet	then this limit/colimit business will get you nothing new.
2013-11-15 17:01:03	shachaf	Hmm, that's true.
2013-11-15 17:01:11	arkeet	but it's reasonably common to do it for ω-things.
2013-11-15 17:01:13	tomprince	consider lim(D) -> colim(D)
2013-11-15 17:01:13	arkeet	at least in math
2013-11-15 17:01:15	shachaf	In retrospect my question indeed didn't make sense.
2013-11-15 17:01:19	tomprince	For a diagram D.
2013-11-15 17:01:48	arkeet	but that gives you new objects.
2013-11-15 17:01:53	tomprince	 That seems a not unreasonable generalization of composition.
2013-11-15 17:02:09	arkeet	one hopes that it's associative in some sense.
2013-11-15 17:05:32	tomprince	Given diagrams D and D', such that x = colim(D) = lim (D')  D' o D is the composite diagram consiting of D, D', x + the limiting/colimiting arrows.
2013-11-15 17:06:11	tomprince	Then lim(D) = lim(D' o D) and colim(D') = colim(D' o D)

2013-11-15 17:08:15	arkeet	that doesn't feel like the right thing.
2013-11-15 17:08:50	tomprince	Well, consider the poset Z, and Z_{>=0}, Z_{<=0}
2013-11-15 17:09:07	tomprince	And a diagram D indexed by Z.
2013-11-15 17:09:54	tomprince	The you have the composition of D_{>=0}, which is D(0) -> lim D(n) =: D(omega)
2013-11-15 17:10:31	arkeet	I don't really see what that has to do with associativity.
2013-11-15 17:11:12	arkeet	ok, well maybe.
2013-11-15 17:11:28	arkeet	I dunno.
2013-11-15 17:11:48	tomprince	Well, consider D = D_1 + D_2 + D_3 (diagrams)
2013-11-15 17:12:16	arkeet	can I go to bed instead of consider?
2013-11-15 17:12:36	tomprince	Such that there is an arrow from everything in D_1 to something in D_2 and no arrows back (in D). And similarily for D_2, D_3.
2013-11-15 17:12:42	tomprince	Of course.

2013-11-19 16:30:23	shachaf	Right. I mean "does it have any interesting structure"?
2013-11-19 16:30:52	shachaf	I guess it doesn't have an initial or terminal object (because there's no functor to the empty category).
2013-11-19 16:31:48	Cale	Well, it's a 2-category
2013-11-19 16:32:55	shachaf	With some sort of category of adjunctions : C -> D?
2013-11-19 16:35:31	Cale	yeah, in fact, you can define maps even between non-parallel adjunctions

2013-11-23 05:14:11	mekeor	it seems that most books on category theory are rather meant to be reference books, as far as i can see. do you know or can you recommend a book on CT which bottom-up explains stuff such that you can self-study it?
2013-11-23 05:16:32	tac	mekeor: That's an interesting factoid, and I've found the same to be true.
2013-11-23 05:17:05	tac	mekeor: what kind of background do you have in traditional mathematics?
2013-11-23 05:17:47	mekeor	tac: well, i'm studying maths (b.sc.) in the first semester.
2013-11-23 05:18:04	tac	neat. I just saw your question in ##math :)
2013-11-23 05:18:11	mekeor	:D
2013-11-23 05:18:44	tac	Category theory is particularly effective when learning abstract algebra.
2013-11-23 05:19:05	tac	Category theory on its own makes it hard to come up with examples
2013-11-23 05:19:19	tac	but if you have another field to draw examples from, it goes down much more easily
2013-11-23 05:20:06	mekeor	tac: uhm, well; does it help to be interested in functional programming languages (like haskell, agda (and the proof assistant isabelle))?
2013-11-23 05:21:00	tac	I know in particular, Lang's Algebra and Aluffi's Algebra Chapter 0, and MacLane&Birkoff's Algebra teach Abstract Algebra with heavy use of categories
2013-11-23 05:21:15	tac	It helps, of course :)
2013-11-23 05:21:40	tac	Although, Haskell's community, IMO, overvalues category theory. Or at least, they don't really understand it so well.
2013-11-23 05:21:54	mekeor	:D i see :)
2013-11-23 05:22:29	tac	Coming from Haskell, you'd end up thinking that monads are just tools for expressing computational state or some ominous notion of "side effects"
2013-11-23 05:22:40	tac	But monads are a tool for studying algebraic structures
2013-11-23 05:23:07	mekeor	hm, i see.
2013-11-23 05:24:01	tac	The key is that many side effects have a nice underlying algebra
2013-11-23 05:24:52	mekeor	actually, i'm not interested that much in the application of ct in haskell or so.
2013-11-23 05:25:13	mekeor	tac: i mean, i know abstract algebra a bit, too ;) :]
2013-11-23 05:26:29	mekeor	(why are these books so expensive? is CT really that popular?)
2013-11-23 05:28:06	tac	$80 for a math book is par for the course
2013-11-23 05:28:30	tac	It's not like a New York Time's best seller. An author might sell a few hundred copies a year.
2013-11-23 05:28:44	tac	But the books can take anywhere from a year to ten to write!
2013-11-23 05:29:16	mekeor	oh, i see.
2013-11-23 05:29:17	tac	thankfully, there are modern "solutions" to these kinds of problems
2013-11-23 05:29:27	FireFly	what I wonder is why SICP still costs about $80.. (at least here)
2013-11-23 05:30:03	FireFly	That book must've sold *plenty* of copies by now..
2013-11-23 05:30:37	tac	SICP is a classic, though.
2013-11-23 05:30:54	tac	Classics will generally sell for full price as long as they are in print.
2013-11-23 05:31:09	tac	I was lucky to get a cheap copy of SICP on ebay, back when that was still a good place to get books :)
2013-11-23 05:31:59	FireFly	So, a book is expensive if it sells very few or very many copies.. you have to hit that middleground if you want a cheap book?
2013-11-23 05:34:02	johnw	that sounds like a good that got overprinted and now is trying to find buyers
2013-11-23 05:43:19	tac	mekeor: There is also, of course, Awodey's book
2013-11-23 05:43:37	tac	Which is a pretty good, well-rounded introduction to category theory
2013-11-23 05:43:51	tac	(Though it is aimed a little more towards logicians, I think)
2013-11-23 05:51:48	arkeet	and then you have textbook authors who have sold millions of copies.
2013-11-23 05:54:04	tac	Number of copies sold is only loosely correlated with the quality of the text :<
2013-11-23 05:56:36	FireFly	Number of copies sold may be correlated with number of courses using said book as course material

2013-11-26 19:24:10	Cale	actually most of those things I wouldn't consider to be ad-hoc
2013-11-26 19:26:30	Cale	Though perhaps I have a stricter notion of what ad-hoc polymorphism is than some. I tend to think of the sort of polymorphism where you're simply allowed to define something at multiple types, and then the implementations are selected between at the point where it's used based on local type information only.
2013-11-26 19:27:37	Cale	Ad-hoc polymorphism doesn't let you define new polymorphic things simply by using existing ones.

2013-11-26 19:56:23	TaylanUB	Hrm, I think I mixed together systems that allow overloading of operators (ad-hoc polymorphism in your terminology; mainly just generics/methods (CLOS) in my list?) and systems that make use of the fact that certain operators are overloaded (rest of the list?), if that makes sense ..
2013-11-26 19:57:22	TaylanUB	Further, some of them are solely "implementation" constructs (mixins) whereas others are solely part of the type-system (interfaces, protocols, type-classes).
2013-11-26 19:58:57	TaylanUB	(Well, type classes also have their own implementation syntax, "member", whereas intrefaces and protocols are purely a declaration facility.)
2013-11-26 20:04:34	TaylanUB	(Err, "instance declaration" not "member".)

Does this have a name, and what's its relation with exponential objects? Is it a case of "if both exist then they're equivalent"itis?

2013-11-28 14:21:50	atamagawarui	I have a cartesian monoidal category. Does it make sense to talk about a "commutative monoid object" in this setting?
2013-11-28 14:22:13	-->	johnw (~user@24-116-100-249.cpe.cableone.net) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-11-28 14:27:27	shachaf	Maybe you're after a "symmetric monoid object"?
2013-11-28 14:28:48	atamagawarui	What additional structure does it have with respect to a regular monoid object?
2013-11-28 14:30:39	arkeet	shachaf: ???
2013-11-28 14:30:47	arkeet	atamagawarui: uh it only makes sense if you have a symmetric monoidal category
2013-11-28 14:30:57	arkeet	uh.
2013-11-28 14:31:00	arkeet	which cartesian is.
2013-11-28 14:31:03	arkeet	so yes
2013-11-28 14:32:13	atamagawarui	arkeet: But not every monoid object in a symmetric monoidal category is a [whatever the term is for analogs of commutative monoids in this setting].
2013-11-28 14:32:21	arkeet	clearly.
2013-11-28 14:32:28	arkeet	commutative monoid is fine.
2013-11-28 14:32:40	arkeet	the symmetric structure just gives you a way to make "commutative" make sense.
2013-11-28 14:32:54	atamagawarui	Ah.
2013-11-28 14:33:46	atamagawarui	So what additional structure would I have to provide to show that a monoid object is a commutative monoid object? A morphism "flip : MxM --> MxM" satisfying some coherence conditions?
2013-11-28 14:33:54	atamagawarui	(Where M is the monoid object.)
2013-11-28 14:34:01	arkeet	uh, flip comes from the symmetric monoidal structure.
2013-11-28 14:34:17	arkeet	your monoid object is commutative when μ . flip = μ
2013-11-28 14:34:21	arkeet	where μ is the multiplication
2013-11-28 14:34:30	atamagawarui	Ah!
2013-11-28 14:37:19	arkeet	well, every cartesian monoidal category is symmetric.
2013-11-28 14:37:28	atamagawarui	What I am actually trying to do is provide a categorical foundation for aggregate functions in databases. (Something like SQL's SUM, PROD, etc.) Basically, given the diagram "A <-g- B -f-> C", where C is a commutative monoid, I want to define a morphism "A -h-> C" that means "select a.id, sum(b.f) from b join a on (a.id = b.id) group by a.id".
2013-11-28 14:37:33	arkeet	i.e. you always have a natural isomorphism A x B -> B x A
2013-11-28 14:37:56	atamagawarui	Ah!
2013-11-28 14:38:05	engimo	doesn't spivak have some stuff about that
2013-11-28 14:38:17	atamagawarui	Yes, yes, I am largely basing what I am doing on his slides.
2013-11-28 14:38:24	atamagawarui	But I saw nothing about aggregate functions there.
2013-11-28 14:39:06	arkeet	are records ordered?
2013-11-28 14:39:12	 *	arkeet doesn't know anything about databases.
2013-11-28 14:39:24	atamagawarui	arkeet: No. That's why I need a commutative monoid instead of just a monoid.
2013-11-28 14:39:27	arkeet	ok.
2013-11-28 14:44:43	atamagawarui	So, well, let's say I have three objects: "employee", "sale", "real". And two morphisms: "total_price : sale -> real" and "seller : sale -> employee". What I want is to construct a morphism "total_sold : employee -> real", using the fact (real, 0, +) forms a commutative monoid. In a sense, total_sold can be constructed from total_price, seller, 0 and +. Is there any name in CT for this construction?
2013-11-28 14:49:38	arkeet	well, you need more than that.
2013-11-28 14:49:45	arkeet	e.g. you need the fact that sale has elements.
2013-11-28 14:49:48	arkeet	finitely many of them.
2013-11-28 14:50:37	arkeet	I just noticed your nick.
2013-11-28 14:50:37	arkeet	=(
2013-11-28 14:50:41	atamagawarui	Oh.
2013-11-28 14:50:44	atamagawarui	No worries.
2013-11-28 14:50:51	atamagawarui	:)
2013-11-28 14:51:44	atamagawarui	True. You are right. I need to make use of the fact that the number of sales that corresponds to every employee is finite. :-|
2013-11-28 14:52:31	arkeet	right.
2013-11-28 14:55:02	atamagawarui	Fortunately, in my design, I already have two notions of types: static types (fixed collections of values: int, real, string, etc.) and dynamic types (collections of finitely many values that allow for inserting/removing at runtime: employee, sale, product, etc.). And for my purposes, this construction can only be used when the diagram is "dynamic <-- dynamic --> commutative monoid" :-)

2013-11-29 01:30:13	tac	I am on the verge of dropping $200 on categorical logic books I don't have time to read :<
2013-11-29 01:31:44	tac	cads: On just linear algebra?
2013-11-29 01:31:52	cads	err
2013-11-29 01:32:01	cads	yeah
2013-11-29 01:32:06	cads	something quick and light
2013-11-29 01:32:14	cads	tac, don't do it!
2013-11-29 01:32:23	tac	I think I have to
2013-11-29 01:32:30	cads	there's a torrent that has a bunch categorical logic books out there
2013-11-29 01:32:32	tac	The topoi demand it
2013-11-29 01:32:36	tac	oh
2013-11-29 01:32:41	tac	I have the books I want as PDFs
2013-11-29 01:32:43	cads	who are you trying to buy?
2013-11-29 01:32:46	cads	ah
2013-11-29 01:32:47	tac	I just won't ever read them if they are PDFs....
2013-11-29 01:32:49	cads	ok
2013-11-29 01:32:54	cads	hehe
2013-11-29 01:33:10	tac	Lambek/Scott and Jacobs
2013-11-29 01:33:11	cads	buy an e-reader
2013-11-29 01:33:20	cads	yeah, I have those too
2013-11-29 01:33:26	cads	they're fun!
2013-11-29 01:33:38	tac	there was one that I couldn't find for free
2013-11-29 01:33:44	tac	Crole's "Categories for Types"
2013-11-29 01:33:46	cads	oh?
2013-11-29 01:33:54	tac	A bit less logicy, more CS-y

2013-11-29 01:35:24	cads	I wonder why
2013-11-29 01:36:40	cads	looks like a nice book
2013-11-29 01:37:22	tac	I can't tell, because Amazon only offers one page of preview!
2013-11-29 01:37:27	tac	(I should try Google Books)
2013-11-29 01:37:31	cads	the review is useful
2013-11-29 01:38:26	tac	You mean the review from probably.author@iwrotethebook.com
2013-11-29 01:39:02	cads	seems like it introduces categories to support set theory and posets, and then builds up to indexed categories to support 4 different types of formal type systems (including polymorphism). It then uses categorical tools to prove things like soundness.
2013-11-29 01:39:32	tac	I don't remember how it came up, but a week or two ago, I realized I didn't know as much logic as I thought I did
2013-11-29 01:39:46	cads	kinda neat sounding, and aimed at the advanced undergrad/grad
2013-11-29 01:39:51	tac	And most of what I know about logic is actually "working mathematician"-grade stuff
2013-11-29 01:40:51	tac	I'd really like to know more about the foundations of HoTT and research in that field.
2013-11-29 01:40:51	cads	I've been wanting to find a nice book that treats sequents and other proof theoretic topics using categories
2013-11-29 01:41:28	tac	I also want to understand something I've always held as an "obvious fact"
2013-11-29 01:41:39	cads	What's that?
2013-11-29 01:41:39	tac	Which is, the real numbers have undecidable equality
2013-11-29 01:42:15	tac	It's so obvious they don't.
2013-11-29 01:42:21	tac	But is it provable they don't :)
2013-11-29 01:42:24	cads	because it'd come down to deciding whether two programs are the same?
2013-11-29 01:42:31	tac	Yeah, intuitively.
2013-11-29 01:42:37	tac	But in some foundation, say HoTT
2013-11-29 01:42:46	cads	sure
2013-11-29 01:42:49	cads	would be nice to see
2013-11-29 01:42:55	tac	Yeah.
2013-11-29 01:44:39	tac	I also would like to know what the COST of using dependent type theory is.
2013-11-29 01:44:50	tac	I realized recently that first order logic, as horrible as it is for expressing yourself
2013-11-29 01:44:54	tac	is much easier to reason about

2013-12-02 04:22:01	tac	hey guys. I'm trying to track down a PDF I read a while ago, but I am having no luck finding it now.
2013-12-02 04:22:25	tac	It was an explanation of sheaves and frames/locales, very well typeset.
2013-12-02 04:22:34	tac	Informal, but informative
2013-12-02 04:23:03	tac	It motivated why we should care about pointless spaces, working with frames instead of topologies
2013-12-02 04:29:20	DT`	aww, I feel like I know which one you're talking about but I can't find it either.
2013-12-02 04:31:05	tac	It was one of those little gem articles that motivated something really well
2013-12-02 04:31:10	tac	I should have tucked it away somewhere safe
2013-12-02 04:36:15	DT`	tac, could it be this one? http://www.math.harvard.edu/~waffle/pointless.pdf
2013-12-02 04:36:46	DT`	oh, wait, sheaves.
2013-12-02 04:37:09	tac	no, that wasn't it
2013-12-02 04:37:45	tac	ty though

2013-12-03 10:55:02	roconnor	So, I'm trying to figure out if a "parameterized monoid" is something that is already defined in Category Theory.
2013-12-03 10:55:11	engimo	what does that mean
2013-12-03 10:55:13	roconnor	My ingredents are C is a monoidal category.
2013-12-03 10:56:04	roconnor	instead of a Monoid object I have a Functor M from (P^op * P) -> C where P is some category of parameters.
2013-12-03 10:56:50	roconnor	I have a transform eta : I -> M(a,a) which is dinatural in a
2013-12-03 10:57:28	roconnor	and I have a multiplication mu : M(a,b) (x) M(b,c) -> M(a,c) which is natural in a and c and dinatural in b.
2013-12-03 10:58:02	roconnor	and a bunch of laws relating eta and mu which are the obvous ones:
2013-12-03 11:00:20	roconnor	like mu . (id (x) eta_b) = rho_M(a,b)
2013-12-03 11:00:39	roconnor	like mu . (eta_a (x) id) = lambda_M(a,b)

2013-12-04 04:50:14	tac	and some collection of arrows {f_j} between pairs of objects* in {a_i}
2013-12-04 04:50:48	tac	So to make it concrete, start with two objects A and B in Sets, and no arrows
2013-12-04 04:50:51	pedro1729	wait let's not use C again
2013-12-04 04:50:56	tac	hah
2013-12-04 04:50:57	tac	sorry
2013-12-04 04:51:04	pedro1729	an object... T in Sets
2013-12-04 04:51:08	tac	Sure
2013-12-04 04:51:24	pedro1729	ok
2013-12-04 04:51:30	tac	A cone then is T together with T_i  (one for each A_i)
2013-12-04 04:51:31	tac	and
2013-12-04 04:51:38	tac	one more thing
2013-12-04 04:52:01	tac	For every arrow in the diagram, you get a triangle
2013-12-04 04:52:41	pedro1729	what triangle
2013-12-04 04:52:44	tac	if f_1 : a_1 -> a_2   then you make a little triangle with    T_1, T_2, and f_1
2013-12-04 04:52:55	tac	(Sorry, this really is better explained with pencil and paper!)
2013-12-04 04:53:29	pedro1729	huh
2013-12-04 04:53:34	pedro1729	and what are the maps between them?
2013-12-04 04:54:10	tac	You mean in the diagram?
2013-12-04 04:54:16	pedro1729	yeah like T_1 -> T_2
2013-12-04 04:54:34	tac	The T_i are all arrows
2013-12-04 04:54:39	tac	T_i : T -> a_i
2013-12-04 04:55:09	pedro1729	ahh..
2013-12-04 04:55:10	pedro1729	got it
2013-12-04 04:55:23	tac	http://flockdraw.com/7yj2wi
2013-12-04 04:55:24	tac	^ here
2013-12-04 04:58:29	tac	pedro1729: That's the visual we should be looking at
2013-12-04 04:58:51	tac	The one last thing is each triangle made by the cone must commute. I'll draw that in green.
2013-12-04 04:58:52	pedro1729	didn't you miss an A_2 and an f_2?
2013-12-04 04:59:47	tac	There
2013-12-04 05:00:19	pedro1729	okay
2013-12-04 05:00:25	tac	So those are our _objects_ in the category of cones
2013-12-04 05:00:52	tac	The objects are: the object T, the collection {T_i}, and everything needs to commute nicely
2013-12-04 05:00:55	pedro1729	the entire diagram is the object?
2013-12-04 05:01:11	pedro1729	okay
2013-12-04 05:01:13	tac	You can think of it like that if you want.
2013-12-04 05:01:33	tac	Or you can think of it as the pair (T, {T_i}) and just restrict to pairs that commute nicely
2013-12-04 05:01:46	pedro1729	okay
2013-12-04 05:01:52	tac	So that gives us the _objects_ in this cone category
2013-12-04 05:01:55	tac	We also need morphisms
2013-12-04 05:02:00	pedro1729	I'm gonna imagine it as a million cones floating around in space with arrows between them
2013-12-04 05:02:16	tac	Basically
2013-12-04 05:02:29	tac	Luckily, the arrows between cones are much simpler than the cones themselves
2013-12-04 05:02:58	pedro1729	i suspect it's just a morphism T -> T' that makes everything that could possibly commute commute?
2013-12-04 05:03:03	tac	Exactly
2013-12-04 05:03:21	pedro1729	hm...
2013-12-04 05:03:27	pedro1729	can we get an example? :p
2013-12-04 05:03:29	tac	Sure
2013-12-04 05:03:38	tac	The one I drew was a stock example of a pullback.
2013-12-04 05:03:56	tac	I'm gonna erase, is that ok?
2013-12-04 05:04:36	pedro1729	sure
2013-12-04 05:07:03	tac	There's a shitty cone. Shitty because it's not the best (terminal) in the category of cones.
2013-12-04 05:07:43	tac	Limits and colimits like minimalism. You want as LITLE data as possible to make everything commute (But not less)
2013-12-04 05:07:58	tac	Obviously, R^3 has an extra "z" component that we aren't using
2013-12-04 05:07:59	pedro1729	ah.. the best would be R^2
2013-12-04 05:08:00	tac	yes
2013-12-04 05:08:13	pedro1729	..maybe
2013-12-04 05:08:54	tac	What does the arrow in the middle need to be? The cone morphism?
2013-12-04 05:09:30	pedro1729	i suppose it forgets the third coordinate
2013-12-04 05:09:34	pedro1729	(x, y, z) -> (x,y)
2013-12-04 05:09:50	tac	Sure.
2013-12-04 05:09:56	tac	What about the commutativity requirements of cone morphisms?
2013-12-04 05:10:03	tac	How does that map satisfy them?
2013-12-04 05:10:16	tac	(And when you say it, you will think you've said nothing, because it's almost vacuously true)
2013-12-04 05:10:33	pedro1729	well (x, y, z) -> (x, y) -> y if you go the long path
2013-12-04 05:10:38	pedro1729	and the short path is (x, y, z) -> y
2013-12-04 05:10:43	tac	yep
2013-12-04 05:10:47	pedro1729	but one minute
2013-12-04 05:11:07	pedro1729	if R^2 is the universal object, shouldn't the map be leaving R^2, and not arriving at it?
2013-12-04 05:12:13	tac	Limits are terminal in the category of cones.
2013-12-04 05:12:20	tac	(I forget which is which between universal and couniversal)
2013-12-04 05:12:31	pedro1729	oh, ok
2013-12-04 05:12:35	pedro1729	i'll use your terminology
2013-12-04 05:13:06	tac	Note that the cone has object coming OUT of it going into the diagram, but we're interested in the particular cone that has only one cone morphism coming IN from any other cone.
2013-12-04 05:14:27	pedro1729	but what if i had used different maps
2013-12-04 05:14:29	tac	We showed with R^3, but you actually need to show *any* cone has exactly one arrow (not many, not zero, exactly one)
2013-12-04 05:14:58	tac	Which different maps are you thinking about?
2013-12-04 05:15:03	pedro1729	if i had used say f(x, y, z) = x + y + z on the right and f(x, y, z) = x * y * z on the left
2013-12-04 05:15:52	pedro1729	isn't that a cone as well?
2013-12-04 05:15:56	tac	Is it :)
2013-12-04 05:16:11	pedro1729	well there are no maps, it needs only commute with the identity
2013-12-04 05:16:19	tac	yeah, so yes. That would be a cone.
2013-12-04 05:16:36	pedro1729	..so doesn't this mean that it needs to factor through R^2?
2013-12-04 05:16:38	tac	So there had better be exactly one cone morphism
2013-12-04 05:16:41	tac	yes
2013-12-04 05:16:50	tac	So maybe
2013-12-04 05:17:11	tac	f : R^3 -> R^2 with f(x,y,z) = (x+y+z, x+y+z)
2013-12-04 05:17:39	pedro1729	oh well i'm an idiot
2013-12-04 05:17:44	tac	naww
2013-12-04 05:17:45	pedro1729	:P
2013-12-04 05:18:05	tac	In general, the cone morphism will always look very simple if you know the two shitty cone functions
2013-12-04 05:18:43	tac	if we have if we are looking at a cone T with maps T_1 and T_2, the map T -> R^2 will look like f(t) = (T_1(t), T_2(t))
2013-12-04 05:18:50	pedro1729	but then doesn't this mean that terminal cones in the category of sets are always products?
2013-12-04 05:19:04	tac	Over this particular diagram.
2013-12-04 05:19:17	tac	Things are different in different diagrams.
2013-12-04 05:19:24	pedro1729	oh..
2013-12-04 05:19:28	pedro1729	it's the product when the diagram is "discrete"
2013-12-04 05:19:31	tac	If we add more objects, we get n-ary products
2013-12-04 05:19:34	tac	Yep!
2013-12-04 05:19:56	tac	1-ary and 0-ary products are also possible
2013-12-04 05:20:23	tac	Things get interesting when you have non-identity morphisms in the diagram
2013-12-04 05:20:25	pedro1729	a diagram with 0 objects?
2013-12-04 05:20:28	tac	Yep
2013-12-04 05:21:03	pedro1729	so wait
2013-12-04 05:21:14	tac	A cone over an empty diagram is... just an object in Sets.... together with the property that any other cone (oject in Sets) where there is a unique cone-morphism (just regular function) in.
2013-12-04 05:21:25	pedro1729	if you have a bunch of groups, say indexed by N, and morphisms G_1 -> G_2 -> G_3 -> ... then their limit is the terminal cone?
2013-12-04 05:21:46	tac	yes
2013-12-04 05:22:02	tac	Technically speaking, the limits is the whole cone (the object plus the morphisms)
2013-12-04 05:22:11	tac	But almost always, we ignore that fact, and just call the object itself the limit.
2013-12-04 05:22:43	tac	(R^2 is actually a limit in two different ways, because the order you pair things doesn't matter, categorically).
2013-12-04 05:23:08	pedro1729	duuuuuuuuude
2013-12-04 05:23:20	pedro1729	coooool....
2013-12-04 05:23:36	tac	And if your a horrible set theorist, it doesn't matter what "construction" you use for things like the cartesian product
2013-12-04 05:23:38	<--	dibblego (~nobody@101.173.175.15) has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2013-12-04 05:24:00	tac	There's no rule that says terminal (or initial) objects are unique
2013-12-04 05:24:14	tac	So what happens if you have TWO terminal cones?
2013-12-04 05:24:20	pedro1729	can limits of nets in topological spaces be seen under this light as well?
2013-12-04 05:24:30	tac	Say, the sets are A and B, and you have AxB and BxA (with the obvious projections)
2013-12-04 05:24:30	pedro1729	wait yes there is
2013-12-04 05:24:41	pedro1729	well they are equivalent in that category
2013-12-04 05:24:54	tac	Yes. They are isomorphic.
2013-12-04 05:25:03	tac	And moreover, there's only ONE isomorphism between them.
2013-12-04 05:25:23	tac	(A lot of order theory can be rephrased in category theory)
2013-12-04 05:25:46	tac	(Because preorders, partial orders, total orders, lattices of all kinds... are all just simple categories)
2013-12-04 05:26:26	tac	So I probably have to go do some work today, but a few more points:
2013-12-04 05:26:40	tac	Try working out an example with more complicated diagrams (ones with arrows). It changes things!
2013-12-04 05:27:13	tac	Also, we worked exclusively with Sets. See what happens in different categories (partial order categories have familiar-looking products)
2013-12-04 05:27:33	tac	And cocones and colimits are exactly dual, but basically the same idea.
2013-12-04 05:28:04	tac	(the cone's have objects coming OUT of the diagram, and you want the initial cone instead)
2013-12-04 05:28:36	pedro1729	I see
2013-12-04 05:29:13	pedro1729	I will reflect upon it
2013-12-04 05:29:16	pedro1729	thanks for the mini-class
2013-12-04 05:29:22	tac	If you work out the examples in Groups or Rings, it's almost magical how they are able to give you the exact requirements for subgroups/rings and quotient groups/rings.
2013-12-04 05:29:30	tac	No problem :)
2013-12-04 05:30:16	pedro1729	I'm gonna go head home, be back later
2013-12-04 05:30:29	tac	(And I'm sure Cale is happy now, since he gave pretty much the exact same lecture to me last year over IRC)
2013-12-04 05:30:31	tac	later man

2013-12-04 21:05:28	alanbur1	cale: I'm back
2013-12-04 21:05:37	Cale	hi
2013-12-04 21:05:41	alanbur1	hi :-)
2013-12-04 21:06:14	Cale	So, natural transformations are mappings between functors...
2013-12-04 21:06:27	Cale	If we have two functors, say F,G: C -> D
2013-12-04 21:06:54	Cale	and we want to provide some kind of notion for what it means to go from one to the other
2013-12-04 21:07:32	alanbur1	that's the bit I'm struggling with - why would you want to go between two categories of functors
2013-12-04 21:08:19	alanbur1	It's the additional layer of abstraction that's making my head hurt :-)
2013-12-04 21:08:39	Cale	Well, for that, you'll need to see the applications, and you'll probably want to understand the definition in the first place
2013-12-04 21:09:07	alanbur1	Yes :-)
2013-12-04 21:10:05	Cale	Okay
2013-12-04 21:10:26	Cale	So, you can think of functors C -> D as being a bit like "sketches" of the category C in the category D.
2013-12-04 21:11:03	Cale	They're sending each of the objects X of C to some objects FX of D, and each of the arrows a: X -> Y in C, to arrows Fa : FX -> FY in D
2013-12-04 21:11:25	Cale	such that each commutative triangle in C is sent to a commutative triangle in D
2013-12-04 21:11:31	Cale	and the identity arrows are preserved
2013-12-04 21:11:47	alanbur1	hmm, I sort of get that
2013-12-04 21:12:03	Cale	It might squish or fold C up into a ball, but it's some kind of image of it
2013-12-04 21:12:11	Cale	okay
2013-12-04 21:12:34	Cale	So, with that intuition in mind, if we have two "drawings" of C sitting in D provided by two functors C -> D
2013-12-04 21:12:42	Cale	how should we begin to map one to the other?
2013-12-04 21:13:09	Cale	Well, we can provide for each object X in C, an arrow in D from FX to GX
2013-12-04 21:13:21	Cale	i.e. between the images of the corresponding points in C
2013-12-04 21:13:46	alanbur1	Ok, I'm kinda visualising a sort of 'shadow puppet' effect
2013-12-04 21:14:37	Cale	and then for each arrow a: X -> Y in C, we want there to be some meaningful thing going on in D between the two images of that arrow
2013-12-04 21:14:46	Cale	So, we have:
2013-12-04 21:14:50	alanbur1	Yep, got it
2013-12-04 21:14:51	Cale	Fa: FX -> FY
2013-12-04 21:14:52	Cale	and
2013-12-04 21:14:58	Cale	Ga: GX -> GY
2013-12-04 21:15:25	Cale	and then our chosen arrows eta_X: FX -> GX, and eta_Y: FY -> GY
2013-12-04 21:15:37	Cale	and that makes a square
2013-12-04 21:15:48	alanbur1	Yes, I've seen those diagrams
2013-12-04 21:15:50	Cale	right
2013-12-04 21:15:59	Cale	So, we're asking for that square to commute
2013-12-04 21:16:06	alanbur1	ok
2013-12-04 21:16:36	Cale	If you want a sort of geometric intuition, perhaps the "right" one, is that commutative triangles and squares etc, are like 2-dimensional "sheets"
2013-12-04 21:16:59	Cale	and we can "deform" the arrows on one edge to the arrows of the other
2013-12-04 21:17:05	Cale	If that makes any sense :)
2013-12-04 21:17:31	Cale	So each arrow in C is turning into this 2D sheet between our two sketches of C that are sitting in D
2013-12-04 21:17:51	Cale	But if that's confusing, feel free to ignore it for now :)
2013-12-04 21:18:05	Cale	It's more important to look at some practical examples
2013-12-04 21:18:16	alanbur1	sort of, that's what I was struggling towards with the shadow puppet analogy - the geometry and colours are distorted between the two categories but the overall 'shapes' are the same
2013-12-04 21:18:22	Cale	What's your background? Are you a Haskell programmer?
2013-12-04 21:18:39	alanbur1	Nope, Scala
2013-12-04 21:18:47	Cale	Okay, well, maybe close enough :)
2013-12-04 21:19:10	Cale	So, imagine a parametric tree datastructure
2013-12-04 21:19:26	Cale	This is a functor on the category of types and functions in your language.
2013-12-04 21:19:58	alanbur1	ok
2013-12-04 21:20:04	Cale	Each type t gets sent to some type Tree t (the type of trees whose nodes are labelled with elements of type t)
2013-12-04 21:20:15	alanbur1	with you so far
2013-12-04 21:20:24	Cale	and each function s -> t can be sent to a function Tree s -> Tree t
2013-12-04 21:20:39	Cale	which just applies the given function to each of the nodes
2013-12-04 21:21:19	alanbur1	hmm, lemme think about that for a moment...
2013-12-04 21:23:27	alanbur1	I get what's happening but I don't see why that's not just an arrow
2013-12-04 21:24:58	alanbur1	It's easy enough to understand the actual usage, I've even done stuff like that in C :-)
2013-12-04 21:25:35	-->	kfish (~conrad@159.27.233.220.static.exetel.com.au) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-04 21:25:58	Cale	In Haskell, we have:
2013-12-04 21:26:02	Cale	class Functor f where
2013-12-04 21:26:11	Cale	  fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
2013-12-04 21:26:27	Cale	The f gives the action of the functor on objects (i.e. types in this case)
2013-12-04 21:26:36	Cale	and fmap gives the action of the functor on arrows
2013-12-04 21:26:49	Cale	Each arrow a -> b is sent to some arrow f a -> f b
2013-12-04 21:26:59	Cale	So, given a Tree datatype like:
2013-12-04 21:27:25	Cale	data Tree a = Tip | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
2013-12-04 21:27:33	Cale	We might have an instance like:
2013-12-04 21:27:39	Cale	instance Functor Tree where
2013-12-04 21:27:45	Cale	  fmap f Tip = Tip
2013-12-04 21:28:01	Cale	  fmap f (Branch x l r) = Branch (f x) (fmap f l) (fmap f r)
2013-12-04 21:28:22	Cale	(Is that readable? :)
2013-12-04 21:28:52	Cale	The idea being that Branch x l r is an internal branch node of the tree, labelled by x, and with left and right subtrees l and r
2013-12-04 21:29:35	alanbur1	Ok, got that, although the haskellese is a little befuddling :-)
2013-12-04 21:29:43	Cale	okay
2013-12-04 21:30:10	Cale	So, just looking at the type in this case,  fmap :: (a -> b) -> (Tree a -> Tree b)
2013-12-04 21:30:24	Cale	(it is curried, so I can choose to write the parens like that)
2013-12-04 21:30:35	alanbur1	yep, got it
2013-12-04 21:30:55	Cale	Does it make sense how Tree becomes a functor like that?
2013-12-04 21:31:12	Cale	Similarly, we can do this with lists
2013-12-04 21:31:21	Cale	and the standard map function gives fmap for lists
2013-12-04 21:31:25	alanbur1	Yes, I think so - basically it's a transform of one tree type into another, correct?
2013-12-04 21:31:52	Cale	The category in question here has as its objects all Haskell types
2013-12-04 21:32:03	Cale	and as its arrows the Haskell-definable functions between those types
2013-12-04 21:32:17	alanbur1	Yep, got it.
2013-12-04 21:32:25	Cale	and we're saying that Tree is a functor from this category to itself
2013-12-04 21:32:35	alanbur1	endofunctor, yes?
2013-12-04 21:32:37	Cale	yes
2013-12-04 21:32:41	alanbur1	yay! :-)
2013-12-04 21:32:49	alanbur1	some of it is beginning to stick :-)
2013-12-04 21:33:20	Cale	Okay, so let's consider the two functors Tree and List (which in Haskell is written with square brackets, but I'll write it as List for clarity)
2013-12-04 21:33:41	alanbur1	Ok...
2013-12-04 21:33:46	Cale	What might be a natural transformation from Tree to List?
2013-12-04 21:34:01	Cale	Well, for each type t, we want a mapping Tree t -> List t
2013-12-04 21:34:17	alanbur1	I can think of 3 immediately, depending on the order you traverse & flatten the tree
2013-12-04 21:34:27	Cale	Right, tree traversals!
2013-12-04 21:34:35	alanbur1	infix, prefix, postfix
2013-12-04 21:35:13	Cale	Written in Haskell, the equation that has to be satisfied for this to be a natural transformation is:
2013-12-04 21:35:20	alanbur1	I think perhaps I've been making it more complicated than it actually is ;-)
2013-12-04 21:35:23	Cale	fmap f . inorder = inorder . fmap f
2013-12-04 21:36:13	alanbur1	ok
2013-12-04 21:36:37	Cale	In category theory notation, if we have f : X -> Y, that's G f . inorder_X = inorder_Y . F f
2013-12-04 21:37:19	Cale	(Haskell's polymorphism lets us not mention which functor is in play, as well as which type we're applying inorder at.
2013-12-04 21:37:20	Cale	)
2013-12-04 21:38:02	Cale	So what this says is that whether we apply f to all the elements of the tree, and then do an inorder traversal, or do the inorder traversal, and then apply f to all the elements of the resulting list, we get the same result.
2013-12-04 21:38:35	alanbur1	bingo - I was just staggering towards that idea :-)
2013-12-04 21:38:38	Cale	So in some way, it's saying that how we do the traversal isn't being affected in any way by the elements of the datatype that the tree is parameterised over.
2013-12-04 21:38:46	alanbur1	yep
2013-12-04 21:38:53	Cale	And in Haskell, this comes for free from polymorphism
2013-12-04 21:39:15	Cale	We literally can't write a function of type Tree t -> List t which is polymorphic and which actually disobeys that rule
2013-12-04 21:39:33	alanbur1	because the type system enforces it, correct?
2013-12-04 21:39:34	Cale	because that function isn't allowed to determine which type t really is and do something different
2013-12-04 21:39:42	alanbur1	yes
2013-12-04 21:39:43	Cale	(we don't have type-case)
2013-12-04 21:39:44	alanbur1	:-)
2013-12-04 21:40:04	Cale	But our lack of type case means we get theorems for free
2013-12-04 21:40:05	Cale	:)
2013-12-04 21:40:28	alanbur1	type-case?
2013-12-04 21:40:52	Cale	i.e. being able to say "oh, traverse the tree this way if there's integers in it, and some other way if there's strings"
2013-12-04 21:41:00	alanbur1	ah, gotcha
2013-12-04 21:42:17	alanbur1	I think the light is slowly beginning to dawn, I need to let it rattle around my head a bit more but the tree-to-list example was very helpful, thank you :-)
2013-12-04 21:42:19	Cale	I don't suppose you know any linear algebra?
2013-12-04 21:42:48	Cale	It really helps to have examples from more than one discipline, even though you can get by in category theory with only self-serving ones.
2013-12-04 21:43:04	alanbur1	I don't think we did that at 'O' level :-)
2013-12-04 21:43:07	Cale	okay
2013-12-04 21:43:56	alanbur1	At the time, even calculus was a step too far - and that was 30+ years ago...
2013-12-04 21:44:12	alanbur1	You are talking to a mathematical ignoramus :-)
2013-12-04 21:45:18	alanbur1	I staggered into this because I wanted to understand (you'll never guess ;-) monads
2013-12-04 21:45:42	Cale	Oh, well, if you're wanting to understand monads *for programming*, then category theory isn't really required.
2013-12-04 21:46:06	alanbur1	Perhaps not but it's helped immensely
2013-12-04 21:46:48	alanbur1	when people say all the "monads are X" tutorials are useless they are I believe understating things - they are positively harmful
2013-12-04 21:46:52	Cale	Well, yeah, and if you pick up some of the examples of categories even just a bit, it's very enriching to see the ideas in other settings too.
2013-12-04 21:47:25	alanbur1	Oh, I'm seeing it everywhere - from the way makefiles work through to test harnesses
2013-12-04 21:48:22	alanbur1	I found Graham Hutton's "Introduction to Category Theory " notes the best resource - http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/cat.html
2013-12-04 21:48:37	Cale	My favourite intro to give to people is Awodey's book
2013-12-04 21:48:48	Cale	http://cale.yi.org/share/S.%20Awodey%20-%20Category%20Theory.pdf
2013-12-04 21:49:43	alanbur1	someone at door, back in a bit :-)
2013-12-04 21:53:53	Cale	I might also recommend my own monad tutorial, which I wrote more for monad tutorial authors than other people, but I think it still serves for someone trying to learn what monads in programming are about: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monads_as_computation
2013-12-04 21:55:12	Cale	I started to see a lot of monad tutorials, especially ones for non-Haskell languages, which completely missed the point.
2013-12-04 21:55:27	alanbur1	thanks, bookmarked. The PDF looks good as well, easier than the 6-7 other ones I've downloaded so far :-)
2013-12-04 21:55:42	Cale	If you can't write code once which will work for an arbitrary monad in the future, then you've completely missed the point of talking about monads in the first place.
2013-12-04 21:56:11	alanbur1	Yes, was speaking to a coworker yesterday and he said "monads, aren't they about doing IO?"
2013-12-04 21:56:30	alanbur1	natural enough question to anyone who has googled them
2013-12-04 21:57:04	Cale	The main reason why we bother defining things as monads isn't out of necessity in any way, it's just that it saves us the trouble of reimplementing all of the stuff in Control.Monad and elsewhere which works over an arbitrary monad.
2013-12-04 21:57:39	-->	Eduard_Munteanu (~EduardMun@188.25.7.248) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-04 21:57:41	alanbur1	it's that abstraction thing that programmers tend to obsess about :-)
2013-12-04 21:57:54	Cale	All the little control-structure-like things like forM and sequence
2013-12-04 21:58:15	Cale	and bigger ones like my A* implementation which operates in an arbitrary monad (or none at all, of course)
2013-12-04 21:58:23	alanbur1	My favorite 1-line explanation is "Monads are to control flow what abstract data types are to data."
2013-12-04 21:58:53	Cale	Yeah, that kinda works
2013-12-04 21:58:57	alanbur1	that was a real "Ahah!" moment
2013-12-04 21:59:35	alanbur1	It doesn't tell you exactly what they *are* but it gives you an insight into what they *do*
2013-12-04 21:59:53	alanbur1	i.e. a higher-level abstraction
2013-12-04 22:00:46	alanbur1	I already know what data abstraction is and I know there are loads of different ones. Just like there are loads of different monads
2013-12-04 22:01:26	Cale	Also, it's worth noting that it's not the only sort of way to abstract over combinator libraries
2013-12-04 22:01:46	alanbur1	Problem with a lot of the tutorials is there is about 1 paragraph of general explanation then a load of very (usually haskell) specific examples
2013-12-04 22:02:24	Cale	There's Applicative and Comonad and Arrow and so on to capture other styles of library consisting roughly of some sort of "computations" and various bits of glue for sticking them together.
2013-12-04 22:02:39	Cale	Oh, I think that's entirely appropriate though.
2013-12-04 22:02:44	Cale	You *have* to see the examples
2013-12-04 22:03:05	Cale	In fact, I don't think I really understood monads properly until I learned about Parsec
2013-12-04 22:03:52	Cale	I understood how to use the list monad and IO and various other things, but it was parser combinators where I really got it :)
2013-12-04 22:03:53	alanbur1	I always get lost in the haskell details. That's why Hutton's notes were so helpful - they were abstract
2013-12-04 22:04:29	alanbur1	abstract but not completely mired in mathematical symbology
2013-12-04 22:06:01	Cale	Well, it does help a lot to have *some* kind of foundations for talking about the stuff
2013-12-04 22:06:21	Cale	Haskell even is actually a bit constraining
2013-12-04 22:06:33	Cale	You can't really give the most interesting examples in it :)
2013-12-04 22:06:52	Cale	and it tends to collapse a lot of ideas down to pale shadows of what they were
2013-12-04 22:06:52	alanbur1	I think that everyone needs to come at this from their own angle, so having a range of ways of explaining it is helpful - eventually you'll find one that works for you
2013-12-04 22:07:40	Cale	But yeah, in a specific setting, you can specialise the explanation of category theory to that setting, and while you might lose a lot of the flavour in some bits, it'll make sense.
2013-12-04 22:08:57	alanbur1	*Exactly* - I don't fully understand Category Theory and I suspect I never will - it requires a level of maths skill that I don't have, but even having a glimmer of a higher-level view makes understanding the lower-level things easier - for me at least
2013-12-04 22:10:37	alanbur1	It reminds me of the "Ahah!" moment when I did a Z notation course many years ago. I wouldn't ever say I was particularly good at it but it gave me new tools to think about problems
2013-12-04 22:12:06	alanbur1	I ended up writing a set of complex database validation rules in it which I could then translate directly into SQL
2013-12-04 22:12:26	alanbur1	I'm hoping a smattering of category theory will give me another set :-)
2013-12-04 22:16:42	Cale	Well, you can probably understand the basics of CT in isolation, but to really appreciate it I think you need a pretty diverse background
2013-12-04 22:18:07	Cale	Algebraic Topology especially helps a good deal in terms of intuition
2013-12-04 22:18:43	alanbur1	Sounds hard :-)
2013-12-04 22:18:45	Cale	(but have to really want to spend 4 years studying mathematics to get that :)
2013-12-04 22:19:08	alanbur1	I'm way too old, and the dyscalculia probably wouldn't help ;-)
2013-12-04 22:23:39	alanbur1	Thank-you very much for your explanation, it's been a terrific help :-)

2013-12-06 01:50:12	Cale	tac: Basically, the way that I think of it is that you're taking your potentially bad category, and "completing" it by making use of the fact that functor categories to Set have essentially all of the nice widgets that Set has.
2013-12-06 01:51:51	Cale	tac: So it's throwing in all the limits and colimits and exponentials, and pretty much everything else that you can imagine, and doing it in such a way that it doesn't stick any new arrows between objects which were already there.
2013-12-06 01:54:12	Cale	I suppose that tells you what it's good for more than what it is
2013-12-06 01:54:27	Cale	But having some motivation is usually helpful in working through the technicalities anyway :)

2013-12-06 01:57:28	Cale	mr-: Well, if the limits or colimits or whatever were already there, it won't have to throw in new ones

2013-12-06 08:11:15	Bor0	can we have a category A and category B so that arrows in category B somehow combines the objects in category A? I want to understand if fold can be seen like this from category theory view
2013-12-06 08:14:16	Cale	Bor0: Well, when you're defining a category, you get to decide what the objects and arrows and composition are
2013-12-06 08:14:23	Cale	But I don't really know what you're asking for here.
2013-12-06 08:15:15	Cale	Folds (or more precisely catamorphisms) can be looked at from a category theoretic standpoint as the unique maps you obtain out of initial F-algebras
2013-12-06 08:15:52	Cale	When you have a recursive datatype, you can encode it as the fixed point of a particular functor
2013-12-06 08:16:11	Cale	(at least sometimes, and those times will be the ones where a fold makes sense)
2013-12-06 08:16:36	Bor0	I was looking at wikipedia/Functor, and the definition says that it associates f : X -> Y to F(f) : F(X) -> F(Y) with identity and composition
2013-12-06 08:16:47	Cale	and algebras for that functor F are objects A of your category (i.e. types in Haskell) together with arrows  a: F A -> A
2013-12-06 08:16:51	Bor0	so I would like to see the difference between a likewise definition but for fold
2013-12-06 08:17:05	Cale	and F-algebra homomorphisms are maps A -> B such that the square involving
2013-12-06 08:17:09	Cale	FA -> A
2013-12-06 08:17:11	Cale	FB -> B
2013-12-06 08:17:24	Cale	as well as Ff: FA -> FB
2013-12-06 08:17:28	Cale	and f: A -> B
2013-12-06 08:17:32	Cale	commutes
2013-12-06 08:18:20	Bor0	okay
2013-12-06 08:18:50	Cale	This description is going to suck without an example
2013-12-06 08:18:57	Cale	So let's consider Nat
2013-12-06 08:19:27	Cale	(the natural numbers)
2013-12-06 08:19:30	Bor0	I understand. map can only map from and to the same type, while fold can map from A to B. map is functor, fold is F-algebra homomorphism?
2013-12-06 08:19:34	Cale	data Nat = Z | S Nat
2013-12-06 08:20:18	Cale	yeah, the fold will be an F-algebra homomorphism, and the things you'd think of as the arguments to the fold will determine the type B and mapping FB -> B
2013-12-06 08:20:32	Cale	So, the F in the case of Nat is Maybe
2013-12-06 08:20:42	Cale	(up to isomorphism)
2013-12-06 08:20:50	Cale	data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
2013-12-06 08:20:56	Bor0	how can we put that definition in terms of as we did for functor: "it associates f : X -> Y to F(f) : F(X) -> F(Y)", does this equation hold for F-algebra homomorphisms too?
2013-12-06 08:21:01	Cale	You can see how if you took a fixed point of Maybe, you basically end up with Nat
2013-12-06 08:21:17	Cale	Maybe is a functor
2013-12-06 08:21:36	Cale	A Maybe-algebra is a type A together with a function Maybe A -> A
2013-12-06 08:22:17	Cale	Nat, together with the map Maybe Nat -> Nat which sends Nothing to Z, and Just n to S n is the initial Maybe algebra
2013-12-06 08:22:47	Cale	and to prove that, we have to see that there's a unique Maybe-algebra homomorphism from that to any other Maybe algebra, b: Maybe B -> B
2013-12-06 08:23:25	Cale	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-algebra (see here, they have a relevant diagram and stuff)
2013-12-06 08:25:10	Cale	I suppose I can go through this in more detail
2013-12-06 08:25:23	Cale	Let's look at what a Maybe-algebra homomorphism has to satisfy more carefully
2013-12-06 08:25:36	-->	ReinH (~reinh@64.71.152.106) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-06 08:25:40	Bor0	yeah that would help I think
2013-12-06 08:25:58	Cale	The square says that if we have two Maybe-algebras (A,a) and (B,b), with a :: Maybe A -> A and b :: Maybe B -> B
2013-12-06 08:26:03	Cale	then
2013-12-06 08:26:22	Cale	our f :: A -> B the Maybe algebra homomorphism has to satisfy  f . a = b . fmap f
2013-12-06 08:26:28	Cale	So, in particular,
2013-12-06 08:26:36	Cale	(f . a) Nothing = (b . fmap f) Nothing
2013-12-06 08:26:41	Bor0	can you tell me what is "the square" here?
2013-12-06 08:26:54	Cale	the one on the wikipedia page
2013-12-06 08:27:03	Cale	Well, I gave the equation
2013-12-06 08:27:16	Bor0	aha, okay
2013-12-06 08:27:20	Cale	So,
2013-12-06 08:27:27	Cale	f (a Nothing) = b (fmap f Nothing)
2013-12-06 08:27:33	Cale	and f (a Nothing) = b Nothing
2013-12-06 08:27:47	Cale	So this will tell us what f is at one point
2013-12-06 08:27:51	Cale	and then
2013-12-06 08:28:00	Cale	(f . a) (Just x) = (b . fmap f) (Just x)
2013-12-06 08:28:02	Cale	so
2013-12-06 08:28:13	Cale	f (a (Just x)) = b (fmap f (Just x))
2013-12-06 08:28:15	Cale	and so
2013-12-06 08:28:27	Cale	f (a (Just x)) = b (Just (f x))
2013-12-06 08:28:43	Cale	Now, let's plug in Nat for A, and the function
2013-12-06 08:28:48	Cale	n :: Maybe Nat -> Nat
2013-12-06 08:28:55	Cale	n Nothing = Z
2013-12-06 08:29:02	Cale	n (Just k) = S k
2013-12-06 08:29:11	Cale	for a
2013-12-06 08:29:17	Cale	So, in that case, we'll get
2013-12-06 08:29:31	Cale	f (n Nothing) = b Nothing
2013-12-06 08:29:39	Cale	f Z = b Nothing
2013-12-06 08:29:44	Cale	and
2013-12-06 08:29:58	Cale	f (n (Just x)) = b (Just (f x))
2013-12-06 08:30:14	Cale	f (S x) = b (Just (f x))
2013-12-06 08:30:30	Cale	So, just to repeat the two relevant lines:
2013-12-06 08:30:33	Cale	f Z = b Nothing
2013-12-06 08:30:35	Cale	f (S x) = b (Just (f x))
2013-12-06 08:30:45	Cale	Do these uniquely determine f?
2013-12-06 08:30:53	Cale	Yes! Recursively
2013-12-06 08:31:22	Cale	We're going through a natural number and replacing each S with (b . Just), and the Z and the end with b Nothing
2013-12-06 08:32:04	Cale	and by choosing b carefully, we can choose (b . Just) to be any function B -> B at all, and b Nothing to be any specific value of type B
2013-12-06 08:32:40	Cale	So this f, whose uniqueness and existence shows that Nat is the initial Maybe-algebra is the fold over the Nat type.
2013-12-06 08:32:56	Bor0	I see. so in terms of category theory, we can state that it associates f : X -> Y to F(f) : F(X) -> F(Y), but F() can be anything we want, it doesn't have to be a 1-to-1 map
2013-12-06 08:33:12	Cale	Er, oh, are you just looking at functors now?
2013-12-06 08:33:36	Cale	Yeah, a functor can do whatever it wants to the objects and arrows, so long as the laws are satisfied
2013-12-06 08:33:42	Bor0	I want to try and see what is the relationship between map and fold. I only know that the former maps A->A and latter A->B
2013-12-06 08:34:29	Cale	I think it helps to understand this clearly in terms of Haskell first, at least, if your background is more in terms of programming
2013-12-06 08:34:35	Cale	So what is a fold really?
2013-12-06 08:34:48	Cale	Suppose we have some datatype like
2013-12-06 08:34:54	Bor0	I see it just like map, except that it doesn't necesarrily keep the same structure
2013-12-06 08:35:13	Cale	data Nature = Rock | Stream Nature | Bush Nature Nature
2013-12-06 08:35:31	Cale	Note that this isn't directly a functor on its own
2013-12-06 08:35:43	Cale	(but it is the fixed point of one)
2013-12-06 08:35:54	Cale	So we can't do fmap
2013-12-06 08:36:01	Cale	But we can write a fold
2013-12-06 08:36:45	Cale	What will the fold do? Well, a fold's job is to go through the structure and replace each Rock, Stream, and Bush, with other values, say rock, stream, and bush of appropriate types.
2013-12-06 08:36:47	Cale	So
2013-12-06 08:36:56	Cale	foldNature rock stream bush = f
2013-12-06 08:36:59	Cale	  where
2013-12-06 08:37:05	Cale	    f Rock = rock
2013-12-06 08:37:17	Cale	    f (Stream n) = stream (f n)
2013-12-06 08:37:32	Cale	    f (Bush n1 n2) = bush (f n1) (f n2)
2013-12-06 08:37:40	Cale	Okay?
2013-12-06 08:37:49	Bor0	yes
2013-12-06 08:37:51	Cale	So, that's the general idea of a fold. If you do that for lists, you get foldr
2013-12-06 08:38:14	Cale	(foldl comes from looking at snoc lists rather than cons lists)
2013-12-06 08:38:26	Bor0	:)
2013-12-06 08:39:18	Bor0	first time I hear about snoc hehe
2013-12-06 08:39:23	Cale	ah, hehe
2013-12-06 08:39:52	Cale	Well, it's just where you have a constructor which takes a list and an element and adds the element to the end of the list
2013-12-06 08:39:56	Cale	rather than the beginning
2013-12-06 08:40:19	Bor0	okay, I think I get the basic idea of fold. how can you express this in terms of category theory? a definition like the one for functor, but not for functor but fold
2013-12-06 08:40:34	Cale	So Haskell's foldl simulates what the fold for snoc lists would do, only it operates on an ordinary cons list.
2013-12-06 08:40:51	Cale	Okay, so in order to be able to do this
2013-12-06 08:41:03	Cale	You need to be able to see your datatype as the fixed point of a given functor
2013-12-06 08:41:12	Cale	For that Nature example I gave
2013-12-06 08:41:16	Cale	it would look like:
2013-12-06 08:41:33	Cale	data F a = R | S a | B a a
2013-12-06 08:41:40	Cale	this is a Functor
2013-12-06 08:41:43	Cale	we can write
2013-12-06 08:41:50	Cale	fmap f R = R
2013-12-06 08:41:58	Cale	fmap f (S x) = S (f x)
2013-12-06 08:42:09	Cale	fmap f (B x y) = B (f x) (f y)
2013-12-06 08:42:40	Cale	So in terms of category theory that fmap :: (a -> b) -> (F a -> F b) says what the functor does to arrows
2013-12-06 08:42:55	Bor0	I see! that is good to know
2013-12-06 08:43:29	Cale	So, Nature is essentially the type-level fixed point of this F
2013-12-06 08:43:42	-->	pedro3005 (~Pedro@unaffiliated/pedro3005) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-06 08:44:17	Cale	We can define it as an F-algebra, n :: F Nature -> Nature
2013-12-06 08:44:23	Cale	n R = Rock
2013-12-06 08:44:34	Bor0	but what I want to know is something more trivial than this. not express a data type in terms of functor but (sorry, I am struggling with my English too), what I want to know is how to express the arrow from fold. is it okay to say this for fold that it associates f : X -> Y to F(f) : F(X) -> F(Y), where F() is some combining function?
2013-12-06 08:44:35	Cale	n (S x) = Stream (n x)
2013-12-06 08:44:52	Cale	n (B x y) = Bush (n x) (n y)
2013-12-06 08:45:24	Bor0	by combining as an example let's take + over [] or sum for lists
2013-12-06 08:45:29	Cale	We *need* this functor F and this F-algebra structure on Nature to be able to express the fold category theoretically
2013-12-06 08:45:37	Bor0	aha, I see!
2013-12-06 08:46:15	Cale	Because Nature is going to be an *initial* F-algebra for this F
2013-12-06 08:46:24	Cale	which means that if we give any other F-algebra whatsoever
2013-12-06 08:46:40	Cale	that is, we just for any type B, give a function F B -> B
2013-12-06 08:46:54	Cale	then we'll get a unique function Nature -> B
2013-12-06 08:47:06	Cale	which satisfies the condition to be an F-algebra homomorphism
2013-12-06 08:47:16	Cale	and *that* will be the fold
2013-12-06 08:47:36	Bor0	so, it is okay to say that functors and fold are tightly connected?
2013-12-06 08:47:39	Cale	and the F B -> B that we gave will somehow be encoding the arguments rock, stream and bush that I gave above
2013-12-06 08:47:42	Cale	(all together)
2013-12-06 08:48:07	Cale	Yeah, but folds are not directly something you get for free with any functor
2013-12-06 08:48:21	Cale	They come out of some situation that you need functors to be able to understand
2013-12-06 08:49:49	Cale	If you have some functor F and an initial F-algebra A, then you have folds over structures of type A
2013-12-06 08:50:57	Cale	(well, there's another kind of fold which comes out of looking at terminal coalgebras, but in Haskell, we can't really tell the difference)
2013-12-06 08:53:34	Bor0	I was just re-reading the conversation and I think I got most stuff sorted. but, what is is that we get for free with any functor?
2013-12-06 08:53:57	Cale	Well, the thing that the functor gives us (part of its definition) is fmap
2013-12-06 08:54:13	Cale	We don't actually get much else from an arbitrary functor
2013-12-06 08:54:27	Cale	Many functors of special types give us more
2013-12-06 08:54:31	Bor0	oh, okay. so we were basically talking about implementing fold on some already existing (not written by us) functor :)
2013-12-06 08:54:43	Bor0	I understand. thanks for the thorough explanation!
2013-12-06 08:55:17	Cale	Well, hmm, given a functor F
2013-12-06 08:55:25	Cale	we can make a recursive datatype from it
2013-12-06 08:55:30	Cale	which we have the fold for
2013-12-06 08:55:41	Cale	I should say that much :)
2013-12-06 08:55:47	Cale	So we can define
2013-12-06 08:56:04	Cale	data Mu f = In (f (Mu f))
2013-12-06 08:56:19	Cale	and then get a fold on that thing automatically
2013-12-06 08:56:29	<--	augur (~augur@129-2-129-32.wireless.umd.edu) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-06 08:56:34	Bor0	but, since we can define fmap in terms of fold, is it okay to say that fold is the generalization of fmap? but, it still needs functor in order to be "functional"
2013-12-06 08:57:26	Cale	Oh, I see what you mean
2013-12-06 08:57:48	Cale	Yeah, in a lot of cases, we can use the fold over a recursive type to define the fmap to turn *that* type into a functor as well.
2013-12-06 08:58:26	Cale	But that relies somewhat on the type parameter occurring the right way
2013-12-06 08:58:43	Cale	We can have a parametric recursive type which has a fold but for which we can't define a suitable fmap
2013-12-06 08:58:49	Cale	like...
2013-12-06 08:59:59	Cale	data Contrived a = Leaf a | Branch (a -> Contrived a)
2013-12-06 09:00:26	Cale	foldContrived leaf branch = f
2013-12-06 09:00:28	Cale	 where
2013-12-06 09:00:40	Cale	  f (Leaf x) = leaf x
2013-12-06 09:00:58	Cale	  f (Branch h) = branch (f . h)
2013-12-06 09:01:22	Bor0	so, but this type doesn't make up a functor, yet we still can fold it?
2013-12-06 09:01:25	Cale	But there's no way to write an fmap to make Contrived into a functor
2013-12-06 09:01:26	Cale	yeah
2013-12-06 09:01:47	<--	echo-area (~user@114.254.107.219) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-06 09:01:48	Bor0	so, back to expressing fold in terms of category theory. for that, we need a functor in order to express it?
2013-12-06 09:01:50	Cale	There *is* however, an associated functor, with an additional parameter
2013-12-06 09:02:23	Cale	data Contrived' a t = Leaf' a | Branch' (a -> t)
2013-12-06 09:02:41	Cale	where instead of recursing, we just put that additional parameter in those places
2013-12-06 09:02:56	Bor0	I see
2013-12-06 09:03:00	Cale	and now we can define
2013-12-06 09:03:07	Cale	instance Functor (Contrived' a) where
2013-12-06 09:03:20	Cale	 fmap f (Leaf' x) = Leaf' x
2013-12-06 09:03:34	Cale	 fmap f (Branch' h) = Branch' (f . h)
2013-12-06 09:04:15	Cale	Note the similarity between the fmap for this new datatype, and the fold for the original Contrived type
2013-12-06 09:05:11	Bor0	yes, except that fmap for Branch' is Branch' -> Branch'
2013-12-06 09:05:32	Cale	Yeah, we're not replacing the constructors with other functions
2013-12-06 09:05:49	Cale	but we're applying a function to each of the values of type t throughout the structure
2013-12-06 09:05:52	Bor0	so basically, the objects are only different, but arrows can remain the same? (between fold and fmap)
2013-12-06 09:06:02	Bor0	wait, I don't know if that makes any sense
2013-12-06 09:06:04	Cale	Objects are types
2013-12-06 09:06:09	Cale	Arrows are functions
2013-12-06 09:06:18	Cale	(whenever we're talking about Haskell)
2013-12-06 09:06:23	Bor0	yes, so we used the same functions but with different type mechanism
2013-12-06 09:06:35	Cale	There's some sort of connection here
2013-12-06 09:06:46	Cale	But what that connection is, takes a little bit of work to express
2013-12-06 09:07:06	Cale	We'd first need to say how it is that Contrived and Contrived' are related
2013-12-06 09:07:52	Cale	and then show how a function  Contrived' a b -> b can be turned into a function Contrived a -> b
2013-12-06 09:08:18	Cale	and when we did that, it would amount to what foldContrived is doing
2013-12-06 09:08:35	Cale	While foldContrived takes two parameters
2013-12-06 09:08:53	Cale	You can think of those as the two parts of a definition of a function Contrived' a b -> b
2013-12-06 09:09:08	Cale	(i.e. what it does for Leaf' and what it does for Branch')
2013-12-06 09:10:08	Cale	If we did this same thing for lists...
2013-12-06 09:10:10	Cale	say
2013-12-06 09:10:22	Cale	data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
2013-12-06 09:10:30	Cale	the associated functor would look like:
2013-12-06 09:10:40	Cale	data List' a t = Nil' | Cons' a t
2013-12-06 09:10:48	Cale	with
2013-12-06 09:10:57	Cale	fmap f Nil' = Nil'
2013-12-06 09:11:15	Cale	fmap f (Cons' x t) = Cons' x (f t)
2013-12-06 09:11:46	Cale	(note how different this is from the fmap on lists)
2013-12-06 09:11:53	-->	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-06 09:11:54	Cale	and now
2013-12-06 09:12:13	Bor0	yes it is, but what is the gain to define such a fmap (on a non recursive data type)?
2013-12-06 09:12:26	Cale	If we have a function (List' a t -> t) can we get a function (List a -> t) ?
2013-12-06 09:13:05	Bor0	I am not sure
2013-12-06 09:13:38	Cale	okay, so our function f :: List' a t -> t will consist of two things:
2013-12-06 09:13:41	Cale	f Nil :: t
2013-12-06 09:14:05	Cale	f (Cons' x y) :: t
2013-12-06 09:14:20	Cale	So... (\x y -> f (Cons' x y)) :: a -> t -> t
2013-12-06 09:14:37	Cale	What does that remind you of? Thinking of folds...
2013-12-06 09:14:47	Cale	:t foldr
2013-12-06 09:14:48	lambdabot	(a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
2013-12-06 09:16:08	Bor0	I see
2013-12-06 09:16:26	Cale	So this is strongly suggestive that algebras of this List' a functor somehow contain precisely the parameters we need to supply to foldr
2013-12-06 09:16:48	Cale	moreover, we can use a newtype to define List a in terms of List' a
2013-12-06 09:17:08	Cale	newtype Mu f = In { out :: f (Mu f) }
2013-12-06 09:17:11	Bor0	List' is more general than List in this case, since we can put t to be another List', right?
2013-12-06 09:17:22	Cale	and then
2013-12-06 09:17:31	Cale	type List a = Mu (List' a)
2013-12-06 09:17:47	Cale	(it's ugly, but it's really the same thing!)
2013-12-06 09:17:49	Bor0	ok, great
2013-12-06 09:18:12	Cale	cata f = f . fmap (cata f) . out
2013-12-06 09:18:25	Cale	and this is the general fold
2013-12-06 09:18:37	Bor0	I see. so a recursive data type is beaten by a data type that can "morph" :)
2013-12-06 09:19:10	Cale	cata :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> Mu f -> b
2013-12-06 09:19:45	Cale	This says, you give me an f-algebra at the type b, and I'll give you a fold on Mu f resulting in b
2013-12-06 09:19:49	Bor0	as a summary, is it correct to state that fold is so general, we need to "close" it up to some functor in order to express it in terms of category theory?
2013-12-06 09:20:19	Cale	Well, the functor helps us express the property which makes the fold special
2013-12-06 09:20:25	Cale	I guess
2013-12-06 09:20:49	Bor0	yes, because it is so general otherwise
2013-12-06 09:22:01	Cale	So, if Haskell gave us some generic way to take an arbitrary recursive type, and extract this functor from it
2013-12-06 09:23:09	Cale	(along with a map between the original recursive type and Mu of that functor)
2013-12-06 09:23:16	Cale	then perhaps we could write a generic fold like this which would work at every recursive type
2013-12-06 09:23:50	Cale	But as it is, this is quite inconvenient, since you have to make a mess of your types to use it, but it's good for showing what the general idea is.
2013-12-06 09:24:18	Bor0	yeah
2013-12-06 09:25:55	Bor0	thank you very much for the help. I guess next I'll look some more into F-algebras
2013-12-06 09:27:19	Cale	yeah

2013-12-12 04:24:22	tac	you don't have a choice of counits
2013-12-12 04:24:25	tac	ever*
2013-12-12 04:24:25	tac	in set
2013-12-12 04:24:32	Cale	right
2013-12-12 04:24:33	tac	or any other category, I guess
2013-12-12 04:24:38	Cale	?
2013-12-12 04:24:51	tac	A comonoid in C is a monoid in C^op
2013-12-12 04:25:21	tac	err
2013-12-12 04:25:21	tac	hmm
2013-12-12 04:25:24	Cale	No, in other categories, or even other monoidal structures on Set (if you can find one), you might have more choices
2013-12-12 04:25:47	tomprince	Or no choices. For +/0 on Set, for example.
2013-12-12 04:25:58	Cale	It's just that we're not just working with Set here, but (Set, ×, 1)
2013-12-12 04:26:08	Cale	and 1 happens to be the terminal object
2013-12-12 04:39:15	Cale	As for something which doesn't have a counit... consider the interval [0,1], and take the comultiplication to send x in [0,1] to (x/2, x/2 + 1/2) in [0,1] x [0,1] (i.e. projecting onto the first component gives the map from [0,1] to its left half, and to the second component gives the map from [0,1] to its right half). Then there's an associator ([0,1] x [0,1]) x [0,1] -> [0,1] x ([0,1] x [0,1]) which sends ((x
2013-12-12 04:39:16	Cale	,y),z) to (2*x, (y+1/4, (z+1)/2)), and that tells you basically how to rearrange one partition of the unit interval into another
2013-12-12 04:40:10	tac	hmm
2013-12-12 04:40:26	Cale	actually, that's a bit funny
2013-12-12 04:40:27	tac	What you say "a category with a monoidal structure" you mean like a weak monoidal category?
2013-12-12 04:40:33	Cale	I shouldn't be choosing the associator map
2013-12-12 04:40:58	Cale	(or if I am, I should assume control over the left and right identities)
2013-12-12 04:41:51	Cale	tac: yeah
2013-12-12 04:42:11	Cale	tac: To talk about monoid objects, or comonoid objects, you need a monoidal category
2013-12-12 04:42:31	tac	k
2013-12-12 04:42:42	Cale	(and the associator is actually part of that structure, so I shouldn't get to pick it like I tried above there :)
2013-12-12 04:42:46	tac	nLab only mentions the special case where we have finite products.
2013-12-12 04:43:02	Cale	That's funny of them
2013-12-12 04:43:07	tac	Yeah I know
2013-12-12 04:43:13	Cale	Usually they're all about generalising everything as far as it'll go
2013-12-12 04:43:13	tac	it's the only comprehensible article on the whole site
2013-12-12 04:44:26	tac	I suppose that might make it clearer why we care about cartesian closed categories, doesn't it?
2013-12-12 04:44:45	tac	I wondered why there was a bias towards products
2013-12-12 04:45:16	Cale	The bias toward products is mostly historical
2013-12-12 04:45:28	tac	I suspect you can do the same thing, essentially, with coproducts
2013-12-12 04:45:37	Cale	A lot of the objects we've studied are sets with some kind of structure on them
2013-12-12 04:45:48	tac	and I had a hunch on the train this morning that you'd simply need to take the other side of the adjoints
2013-12-12 04:46:46	shachaf	Haskell with Either/Void is monoidal but boring in a similar way to how (,)/() comonoids are boring.
2013-12-12 04:47:05	Cale	and Set doesn't have coexponential objects
2013-12-12 04:47:15	tac	hmm
2013-12-12 04:48:06	shachaf	In what other ways is "Hask" monoidal?
2013-12-12 04:50:02	Cale	(which usually results in the objects of the other categories we've studied not having coexponentials)
2013-12-12 04:51:24	tomprince	shachaf: (,) and ()
2013-12-12 04:51:39	shachaf	tomprince: Other ways than the two ways I mentioned. :-)
2013-12-12 05:04:18	shachaf	"In category theory, comonoids serve to make the point that, for a suitably closed category C, cartesian closedness as a global property of C can be expressed instead as a local property of individual objects of C, namely that each be a comonoid."
2013-12-12 05:05:29	shachaf	How are comonoids related to exponentials?
2013-12-12 05:05:37	shachaf	Maybe I should actually read the paper.

2013-12-12 06:26:27	tac	its counit is the first projection and its comultiplication takes (a,z) ↦ ((a, z), z)
2013-12-12 06:29:15	tac	Yeah, that looks like it satisfies all the laws
2013-12-12 06:29:48	shachaf	In any category?
2013-12-12 06:29:53	tac	With products
2013-12-12 06:30:47	tac	Although, I guess I only verify them in set

2013-12-12 06:32:16	shachaf	(I don't know what categorical product is in that scenario, but maybe you shouldn't be free to discard/duplicate values like that.)
2013-12-12 06:32:17	tac	But as long as it works in set, I'm content for the moment
2013-12-12 06:32:44	tac	I only did verify them in set, though, so anything else, yeah, it won't necessarily work
2013-12-12 06:32:46	shachaf	Well, yes, in Set, (A x -) is a comonad.
2013-12-12 06:33:20	shachaf	Hmm, (A x -) is a comonad whenever A is a comonoid, and a monad whenever A is a monoid.
2013-12-12 06:33:39	tac	What categories would have interesting comonoids?
2013-12-12 06:33:50	shachaf	Chu!\
2013-12-12 06:34:58	shachaf	Probably some sort of linear logic (which Chu can be a model for, of course).

2013-12-12 07:03:49	shachaf	Don't you want an exponential object there instead of Hom()?
2013-12-12 07:04:21	tac	It would be slightly more general, but isn't Hom the same as the exponential object in set?

2013-12-12 07:14:48	shachaf	And (S x) isn't in general a monad either.
2013-12-12 07:15:08	shachaf	But the composition of a functor with its left adjoint is always a monad.
2013-12-12 07:15:21	tac	ahh
2013-12-12 07:16:54	tac	And I believe the composition, in the other order, of a functor with its right adjoint is always a comonad?

2013-12-12 07:23:48	tac	oh

2013-12-13 07:50:21	arkeet	hm, has anyone used this category for anything:
2013-12-13 07:50:39	arkeet	objects = finite sequences with elements from some set S
2013-12-13 07:50:51	arkeet	morphisms = inclusions of subsequences
2013-12-13 07:51:20	arkeet	e.g. if S = {A,B} there are 4 morphisms from AB to AABB
2013-12-13 07:51:28	arkeet	if S has 1 element then this is the simplex category
2013-12-13 07:51:43	arkeet	(and there are no morphisms from AB to BA, say)
2013-12-13 07:52:06	benmachine	I've definitely seen something a bit like this before
2013-12-13 07:52:32	benmachine	I think it was when someone was trying to teach me about wellquasiorders
2013-12-13 07:52:52	benmachine	but that's only relevant insofar as that sort of mapping came up, I didn't learn about the category structure at all
2013-12-13 07:54:33	arkeet	oh wait
2013-12-13 07:54:40	arkeet	my last statement isn't quite true
2013-12-13 07:54:52	arkeet	since there are no morphisms from AA to A say
2013-12-13 07:54:59	arkeet	but maybe there should be

2013-12-13 07:55:36	shachaf	Monotonic functions from indices in the first sequence to the second such that the values match?
2013-12-13 07:55:39	arkeet	yes
2013-12-13 07:58:34	arkeet	I guess you could think of them as simplices with coloured vertices
2013-12-13 08:01:42	Saizan	i've used that as typed injective renamings between contexts of the STLC
2013-12-13 08:36:10	arkeet	shachaf: yeah it's probably something like the pullback of Delta -> finite sets and  finite sets under S -> finite sets
2013-12-13 08:36:29	jgross	I'm probably including a comparison of various category theory libraries in a paper I'm writing for ITP.

2013-12-17 23:45:25	quaestor	Has anyone ever seen a representation of strong monads/Kleisli triples where the strength was already included in the Kleisli star? So that the Kleisli star has a type like (-)* : (A -> B x TX) -> (TA -> T(B x X)) or so? A colleague just mentioned this, but he doesn't recall where he's seen it.

2013-12-19 05:42:45	NickKidman	In the construction of the (bounded?) quantifiers via adjoints in the fibred category (of subsets over a set?), is there any restriction on the sets? (I'm asking about cardinality issues specifically)
2013-12-19 05:42:45	NickKidman	I essentially ask this because it feels like the aim is to fully describe first order predicate logic internally in a category - however as set theory is build over that theory, I'm not sure how natural it is to start with the logical universe of discourse being some set.

2013-12-23 22:41:49	augur	the intuition behind the claim is that S*T contains every combination of S's and T's possible
2013-12-23 22:41:53	Saizan	LuxuryMode: they have half inverses
2013-12-23 22:42:09	augur	showing it, well. thats half the fun. :)
2013-12-23 22:42:25	LuxuryMode	does S x T -> S necessarily mean the function that takes the first coordinate of the ordered pairs to itself?
2013-12-23 22:42:30	LuxuryMode	or no...we dont know that...
2013-12-23 22:42:48	Saizan	yep, that's what's meant here
2013-12-23 22:42:57	augur	it ends up meaning that in the category Set
2013-12-23 22:42:58	LuxuryMode	How am I supposed to know that?
2013-12-23 22:43:27	LuxuryMode	when i read that, all im thinking is "ok theres a function with domain S x T and codomain S"
2013-12-23 22:43:27	augur	it comes from the definition!
2013-12-23 22:43:28	augur	sort of
2013-12-23 22:43:33	Saizan	well, it's the canonical projection for the cartesian product
2013-12-23 22:44:02	LuxuryMode	S x T is or S x T -> S/T ?
2013-12-23 22:44:26	augur	you have to remember, LuxuryMode: the categorical content is given by specifying things outside of the categorical context you're working with
2013-12-23 22:44:42	Saizan	S x T is the cartesian product of S and T, proj1 and proj2 are the projections
2013-12-23 22:44:45	augur	so when we say that cartesian product is a categorical product, say, its because we have cartesian products already
2013-12-23 22:44:55	Saizan	i don't know the context though
2013-12-23 22:45:04	augur	by definition of the cartesian product,   proj1 (x,y) = x
2013-12-23 22:45:13	Saizan	is it defining what a cartesian product is, or just referencing it?
2013-12-23 22:45:35	augur	and by definition,  p is in S*T iff p = (x,y) for some x in S and y in T
2013-12-23 22:45:35	LuxuryMode	augur oh ok that makes perfect sense, i just had no idea the function mean (x, y) => x
2013-12-23 22:45:43	LuxuryMode	but i figured thats the only way it could make sense
2013-12-23 22:45:55	augur	Saizan: oh, well, its referencing it yes, sorry
2013-12-23 22:46:04	augur	i meant the projection for the product
2013-12-23 22:46:04	LuxuryMode	i was thinking "uh, how the hell do they know that ANY function S x T -> S is surjective?"
2013-12-23 22:46:46	LuxuryMode	I think the main issue was that the book just wasn't super clear
2013-12-23 22:46:48	augur	thats an important thing to realize tho about this stuff: the mathematics is merely a way of describing things that were always lurking there to begin with, so to speak
2013-12-23 22:47:01	augur	you have to keep that in mind
2013-12-23 22:47:50	augur	you have to be aware of whats taken as "given" -- in this case, we take cartesian products as given things we can use
2013-12-23 22:49:07	LuxuryMode	augur not sure I get where you're coming from. Where in my question does it seem that that's the idea I was missing/tripping up on?
2013-12-23 22:49:43	augur	well, you didnt seem to think we were using cartesian products of the usual sort. maybe i misunderstood what you meant
2013-12-23 22:50:13	augur	anyway, im going to go get breakfast. see ya! :)
2013-12-23 22:50:42	LuxuryMode	My confusion was simply: how can we know that this function is surjective? Perhaps the function is (s, t) = s*t or s2 + t22 for all I know
2013-12-23 22:50:42	LuxuryMode	http://imgur.com/LGbIxYC
2013-12-23 22:50:44	LuxuryMode	this is all the book said
2013-12-23 22:50:53	LuxuryMode	augur cool, enjoy. thanks for your help. appreciate it
2013-12-23 22:51:06	augur	sure, but it also says proj_1 and proj_2
2013-12-23 22:51:40	Saizan	LuxuryMode: i guess i was wrong saying yes to "does S x T -> S necessarily mean ...?" it's just that the projection is meant to be that way
2013-12-23 22:51:41	augur	those are standard parts of mathematical vocabulary for cartesian products
2013-12-23 22:51:55	LuxuryMode	Saizan right, exactly. thats what i didnt get
2013-12-23 22:52:34	LuxuryMode	the book meant, by definition of the projection function, its surjective, etc...

2013-12-26 09:06:44	LuxuryMode	Learning about hom-sets and I read this: Let f : T -> V be a function. The function Hom(S, f ) : Hom(S, T ) -> Hom(S, V )is defined by Hom(S,f)(g) = f compose g
2013-12-26 09:07:33	LuxuryMode	if Hom(S, T) denotes the set of all functions with domain S and codomain T, what exactly does Hom(S, f) mean?
2013-12-26 09:07:40	LuxuryMode	the codomain is a function?
2013-12-26 09:07:42	LuxuryMode	im confused
2013-12-26 09:08:48	shachaf	Remember that a functor usually has two parts, the part mapping objects and the part mapping arrows.
2013-12-26 09:09:18	LuxuryMode	im in the preliminary section in Barr and Wells book
2013-12-26 09:09:30	LuxuryMode	and they haven't introduced functors yet
2013-12-26 09:09:33	shachaf	People tend to write them the same way, e.g. F(f) : F(A) -> F(B)
2013-12-26 09:09:39	shachaf	Oh.
2013-12-26 09:10:13	LuxuryMode	Apparently this is supposed to be clear w/o the idea of functors yet
2013-12-26 09:10:41	LuxuryMode	the book does say: "Note that Hom(S,x) is over- loaded notation: when x is a set, Hom(S, x) is a set of functions, but when x is a function, so is Hom(S, x)."
2013-12-26 09:11:05	LuxuryMode	does that mean that sometimes Hom denotes a set and other times it can be a function/mapping between hom-sets?
2013-12-26 09:11:31	shachaf	Yes.
2013-12-26 09:11:45	LuxuryMode	ok
2013-12-26 09:13:23	LuxuryMode	having trouble with their proof of the following: "that if S is not the empty set, then f is injective if and only if Hom(S,f) is injective"
2013-12-26 09:15:01	LuxuryMode	"Suppose f is injective and that Hom(S,f)(g) = Hom(S,f)(h). Then f compose g = f compose h. Let x be any element of S.Thenf(g(x))=f(h(x)) and f is injective, so g(x) = h(x). Since x is arbitrary, g = h."
2013-12-26 09:15:37	LuxuryMode	thats the first part
2013-12-26 09:15:53	LuxuryMode	what does "Since x is arbitrary, g = h." mean?
2013-12-26 09:16:00	LuxuryMode	just that the functions are equal?
2013-12-26 09:17:36	LuxuryMode	and why is that a result of f being injective? because injective means that if s != s' then f(s) != f(s')?

2013-12-26 20:07:36	LuxuryMode	In this example, unlike the previous ones, the nodes do not form a set. (See 1.1.3.)" Why don't they form a set?

2013-12-26 20:11:36	Saizan	LuxuryMode: it's a pretty technical reason, if you formalize a set theory with "a set of all sets" you can usually create paradoxes
2013-12-26 20:12:47	Saizan	LuxuryMode: so one often also talks about small and large sets, and you can have a large set of all small sets. large sets are also called classes
2013-12-26 20:13:08	LuxuryMode	right
2013-12-26 20:13:10	LuxuryMode	"A graph that has a set of nodes and arrows is a small graph; otherwise, it is a large graph."
2013-12-26 20:14:05	LuxuryMode	So the main idea is that there are paradoxes if you talk about a set of all sets?
2013-12-26 20:14:09	Saizan	(i might be mixing terminology here, but i haven't done much classical set theory myself)

2013-12-26 20:14:30	Saizan	anyhow, yep
2013-12-26 20:14:38	LuxuryMode	im currently reading Barr and Wells's "Category Theory for Computing Science"
2013-12-26 20:14:45	LuxuryMode	and that part kinda threw me off
2013-12-26 20:15:04	LuxuryMode	wasnt clear on why the introduced that...seemed like kind of an edge thing to talk about as a preliminary
2013-12-26 20:15:24	Saizan	you have to stratify, so you can have a large set of small sets, and you might have an even larger set of large sets.. some theories have an infinite hierarchy like that
2013-12-26 20:15:52	Saizan	yeah, it's a fairly technical detail i'd say
2013-12-26 20:16:42	LuxuryMode	large set? i've only seen the term large/small applied to "a graph" ... so far
2013-12-26 20:16:45	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-26 20:17:06	LuxuryMode	or did you mean the same thing?
2013-12-26 20:19:37	LuxuryMode	So in this book, for a graph G they use G0 to denote the nodes and G1 to denote the arrows. They say "Note that if G is a small graph, source: G1 -> G0 and target: G1 -> G0 are functions."
2013-12-26 20:19:56	LuxuryMode	I don't understand what that means. I thought when speak of target/source, we're talking about nodes
2013-12-26 20:20:14	LuxuryMode	what does it mean for G1 -> G0 and G0 -> G1 to be target/source?
2013-12-26 20:21:51	-->	copumpkin (~copumpkin@unaffiliated/copumpkin) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-26 20:23:04	Saizan	G0 is the collection of nodes of the graph G, while G1 is the collection of arrows of it
2013-12-26 20:23:30	Saizan	so when it says "source : G1 -> G0" it's saying that source is something that goes from G1 to G0
2013-12-26 20:23:45	Saizan	i.e. from arrows to nodes
2013-12-26 20:24:13	Saizan	foo : X -> Y is used to state that foo is some sort of map from X to Y
2013-12-26 20:24:58	LuxuryMode	i dont get it
2013-12-26 20:25:02	LuxuryMode	you said: so when it says "source : G1 -> G0" it's saying that source is something that goes from G1 to G0
2013-12-26 20:25:14	LuxuryMode	but i thought source just refers to the G1 side of that
2013-12-26 20:25:35	LuxuryMode	the arrow has a source and a target, no?
2013-12-26 20:25:53	LuxuryMode	how can we speak of a source going from x to y?
2013-12-26 20:26:18	Saizan	in that sentence you have to think of source as an operation that given an arrow returns its source
2013-12-26 20:27:12	Saizan	just like in programming we'd have a function length : List A -> Int that calculates the length of the input list
2013-12-26 20:27:57	Saizan	we use the same word to denote two different but related things
2013-12-26 20:28:03	LuxuryMode	hmm
2013-12-26 20:28:25	LuxuryMode	that confuses me bc it seems like its confusing terminology
2013-12-26 20:28:34	LuxuryMode	its using source to mean function
2013-12-26 20:28:51	LuxuryMode	i guess it makes sense if thats just the name of a function that given the arrow returns its source
2013-12-26 20:28:58	LuxuryMode	i think i get it, that actually make sense
2013-12-26 20:29:12	Saizan	right, that particular function
2013-12-26 20:30:07	LuxuryMode	Thanks for you help Saizan
2013-12-26 20:30:17	LuxuryMode	i'll be back to later to bug you some more :)

2013-12-28 05:05:33	Saizan	it's still a free construction, but between different kind of structures
2013-12-28 05:07:18	tomjack	thanks, haven't found any other examples in Mac Lane yet so I guess I assumed that was the general construction
2013-12-28 05:09:25	shachaf	"free" has a general meaning that's probably in the chapter on adjoints.
2013-12-28 05:11:26	shachaf	But actually it looks like he already gives a pretty general definition in that section, just restricted to categories and graphs.

2013-12-28 13:25:42	noh	would someone here be able to help me start a category theory question? Here it is: Can someone help me with a category theory question? My task is: Show that if f:A->A is a map in a category which satisfies ff = f, then the pair of maps f and 1_A have an equaliser iff there exist maps e:E->A and h:A->E with he = 1_E and eh = f
2013-12-28 13:25:56	shachaf	Is that from Barr and Wells?
2013-12-28 13:26:01	noh	i have no idea
2013-12-28 13:26:10	shachaf	I remember a question like that.
2013-12-28 13:26:20	shachaf	Actually it was a bit different.
2013-12-28 13:27:12	shachaf	Anyway, where are you stuck?
2013-12-28 13:27:20	noh	how to begin the <= direction
2013-12-28 13:27:57	noh	i'm trying to do the <= direction and using this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equaliser_(mathematics)) definition of an equaliser, and i am not even sure how to start this
2013-12-28 13:28:02	noh	in the definition in the link, they say an equaliser consists of an object E (which I will call Q from now on) and a morphism eq satisfying f o eq = g o eq whcih also satisfies the universal property
2013-12-28 13:28:07	noh	and in the universal property they say "for any object O and morphism m satisfying fm = gm, there exists a unique u s.t. eq o u = m"
2013-12-28 13:28:25	noh	in my question, would i only be concerned with objects E which have morphisms e and h such that he = 1_E and eh = f AS WELL AS f o e = 1_A o e?
2013-12-28 13:28:58	noh	sorry, this last line is wrong
2013-12-28 13:29:28	noh	ok i am completely stuck
2013-12-28 13:32:56	shachaf	Well, you want to show that an equalizer exists, but the definition of an equalizer just asks for any equalizing arrow.
2013-12-28 13:33:08	shachaf	I think I'm not helping by using that terminology. :-)
2013-12-28 13:34:23	shachaf	You can assume -- and it might help to draw a diagram of this -- that there are two maps, e and h, satisfying the property you mentioned.
2013-12-28 13:35:26	shachaf	And you have to show that f and the identity arrow of A have an equalizer -- which means the general definition of an equalizer.
2013-12-28 13:35:36	shachaf	Or maybe I misunderstood your question.
2013-12-28 13:36:11	noh	i think that's right
2013-12-28 13:38:42	shachaf	It might help you to figure out what this is saying e.g. in Set, by the way, if you haven't.
2013-12-28 13:38:52	shachaf	(Or it might not help, I don't know.)
2013-12-28 13:46:47	noh	the equaliser wont consist of the object E will it
2013-12-28 13:47:04	noh	i mean the object E which is mentioned above in e: E->A
2013-12-28 13:47:17	noh	what i'm really not sure about is how to draw this diagram

2013-12-30 05:55:26	quchen	Reporting in.
2013-12-30 05:55:40	Cale	So, let's try to do this more carefully
2013-12-30 05:56:24	Cale	We have some monoid M which is an object in Set, and it comes equipped with some functions, a unit, e: 1 -> M and multiplication, m: M x M -> M
2013-12-30 05:56:32	-->	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-30 05:56:47	Cale	We'll also want to be able to explain the laws of the monoid by saying that certain compositions of functions work out to be equal
2013-12-30 05:57:25	Cale	Ordinarily, the laws are stated like 1 * a = a for any element a in M, and similarly with a * 1 = a
2013-12-30 05:57:37	Cale	and that for any a, b, c in M, we have a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c
2013-12-30 05:57:37	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 05:58:20	-->	zett_zelett (~zett_zele@93.231.161.149) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-30 05:58:33	Cale	So taking a look at that first unit law, if we want to write things in terms of m and e, well, first we can translate the multiplication, so we have m(1,a) = a
2013-12-30 05:58:51	startling	is this ^ 1 also the 1-element set?
2013-12-30 05:59:03	Cale	Sorry, this 1 is the 1 in M
2013-12-30 05:59:09	Cale	lol
2013-12-30 05:59:12	startling	can we give them different names? :)
2013-12-30 05:59:23	Cale	Yeah, maybe let's call this u in M
2013-12-30 05:59:29	Cale	So u * a = a
2013-12-30 05:59:32	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:00:00	Cale	Let's take 1 = {0}, and e(0) = u
2013-12-30 06:00:08	startling	sure.
2013-12-30 06:00:11	Cale	Now all our things are labelled with different labels :)
2013-12-30 06:00:17	Cale	okay
2013-12-30 06:00:32	Cale	So, our law is m(e(0),a) = a
2013-12-30 06:00:32	startling	so we want to say something like m(e(0), a) = a and vice-versa
2013-12-30 06:00:35	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:00:35	startling	yeah
2013-12-30 06:01:13	Cale	So, if we start with 1 x M we get a function to M x M which applies e to the first component
2013-12-30 06:01:23	Cale	That's usually written e x M
2013-12-30 06:01:28	Cale	or e x id_M
2013-12-30 06:01:57	startling	is this x cartesian product or something else?
2013-12-30 06:01:58	Cale	and then we can go from M x M -> M by multiplying
2013-12-30 06:02:03	Cale	yeah, Cartesian product
2013-12-30 06:02:30	zett_zelett	Aside from the haskellers who just have joined, this channel is actually dead, isn’t it?
2013-12-30 06:02:36	startling	could you expand more on "So, if we start with 1 x M..."?
2013-12-30 06:02:37	Cale	zett_zelett: not completely
2013-12-30 06:02:49	startling	zett_zelett, they're all in #categorytheory apparently
2013-12-30 06:02:53	Cale	zett_zelett: There's a bit of chatter every once in a while
2013-12-30 06:03:17	Cale	startling: Well, okay, so we're going to have a diagram like this:
2013-12-30 06:03:25	Cale	M -> 1 x M -> M x M -> M
2013-12-30 06:04:06	Cale	the arrow M -> 1 x M is going to be the isomorphism which says that 1 is kind of a "unit" of sorts for the Cartesian product

2013-12-30 06:04:41	Cale	and then the map 1 x M -> M x M will be e x id_M, which sends (0,a) to (e(0),a)
2013-12-30 06:05:10	Cale	i.e. "first e" using Control.Arrow's notation ;)
2013-12-30 06:05:28	startling	right, ok.
2013-12-30 06:05:33	Cale	and then M x M -> M will be given by our multiplication m
2013-12-30 06:05:54	Cale	and the idea is that this whole composite should be the same as the identity map id_M
2013-12-30 06:05:58	startling	so now we have "M is isomorphic to a subset of M x M"?
2013-12-30 06:06:05	Cale	nope
2013-12-30 06:06:09	Cale	er, yes
2013-12-30 06:06:11	Cale	kinda
2013-12-30 06:06:12	startling	haha.
2013-12-30 06:06:22	Cale	I don't want to talk about subsets though
2013-12-30 06:06:37	Cale	Subsets are a weird thing to try to generalise to another category

2013-12-30 06:06:48	Cale	(you can do it, but we're not going to go there today)
2013-12-30 06:07:15	startling	ok. we also have "M is isomorphic to M x M", which is trivially given by a bijective binary operation, isn't it?
2013-12-30 06:07:22	startling	oh, but we don't have one of those.
2013-12-30 06:07:26	Cale	no, M isn't isomorphic to M x M
2013-12-30 06:07:35	Cale	But M is isomorphic to 1 x M
2013-12-30 06:07:40	zett_zelett	In #categorytheory there is just one guy.
2013-12-30 06:07:41	startling	Ok. Maybe i don't understand your "diagram" notation.
2013-12-30 06:07:45	Cale	and then we just have a function 1 x M -> M x M
2013-12-30 06:07:50	Cale	which is not an isomorphism
2013-12-30 06:07:54	startling	these diagrams aren't transitive?
2013-12-30 06:08:05	Cale	Not all of our functions are isomorphisms
2013-12-30 06:08:08	startling	ah, ok.
2013-12-30 06:08:17	Cale	We're lining up a bunch of functions to compose them together
2013-12-30 06:08:23	startling	ok, fair enough.
2013-12-30 06:08:40	startling	so, we compose them and get M -> M?
2013-12-30 06:08:43	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:08:55	startling	what's the significance of that function?
2013-12-30 06:08:57	Cale	and our unit law says that should be the identity on M
2013-12-30 06:09:01	startling	oh, I see!
2013-12-30 06:09:03	Cale	when we compose these parts
2013-12-30 06:09:10	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:09:24	Cale	The trick is just that we're somehow avoiding talking about particular elements of M in doing this translation
2013-12-30 06:09:29	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:09:36	Cale	We can do the other unit law, it's very similar
2013-12-30 06:09:45	Cale	M -> M x 1 -> M x M -> M
2013-12-30 06:09:55	startling	yeah, makes sense.
2013-12-30 06:10:08	Cale	only we're using the other isomorphism M -> M x 1, and we're using id_M x e instead of e x id_M
2013-12-30 06:10:16	Cale	okay
2013-12-30 06:10:32	Cale	So, now associativity says that m(m(a,b),c) = m(a,m(b,c))
2013-12-30 06:10:32	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:11:00	Cale	So, if we start out at (M x M) x M, we can apply m x id_M to get to M x M
2013-12-30 06:11:06	Cale	and then apply m to get to M
2013-12-30 06:12:03	startling	so what's this x for functions?
2013-12-30 06:12:03	Cale	Or, we can use the isomorphism (M x M) x M -> M x (M x M), which says that the Cartesian product is associative up to isomorphism, and then apply id_M x m to get to M x M, and finally m to get down to M
2013-12-30 06:12:15	Cale	(f x g)(x,y) = (f x, g y)
2013-12-30 06:12:39	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:12:40	Cale	sorry to use x there
2013-12-30 06:12:46	Cale	one of the x's is ascii art for ×
2013-12-30 06:12:58	startling	it's fine. I'm a programmer, I have problem with shadowing. :)
2013-12-30 06:13:00	Cale	okay
2013-12-30 06:13:10	startling	haha, *no problem
2013-12-30 06:13:41	Cale	Okay, so our associativity law says that these two ways to go from (M x M) x M to M should be equal
2013-12-30 06:14:05	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:14:06	Cale	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid_(category_theory) -- you might want to peek at the diagrams here
2013-12-30 06:14:27	Cale	But that also contains spoilers
2013-12-30 06:14:43	Cale	We're going to generalise this whole thing now, from sets to a more general sort of category
2013-12-30 06:14:45	startling	I'll open a tab and minimize it before it renders.
2013-12-30 06:14:48	Cale	hehe
2013-12-30 06:15:01	Cale	Well, it has the diagrams for associativity and unit laws
2013-12-30 06:15:40	Cale	So, let's think about what ingredients we really needed. We still need some analogue to the one element set 1
2013-12-30 06:15:53	Cale	and we need some analogue to the Cartesian product
2013-12-30 06:16:02	startling	makes sense.
2013-12-30 06:16:09	Cale	and the important things we needed were some isomorphisms:
2013-12-30 06:16:54	Cale	A left unit isomorphism:  λ: 1 x M -> M, and a right unit: ρ: M x 1 -> M
2013-12-30 06:17:02	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:17:08	Cale	and an associator: α: (M x M) x M -> M x (M x M)
2013-12-30 06:17:22	startling	mhm.

2013-12-30 06:17:48	Cale	and we needed to be able to apply x to functions as well
2013-12-30 06:18:25	startling	is this really "applying x to functions" or is it "there needs to be an analogous operation for functions"?
2013-12-30 06:19:11	Cale	i.e. we need a way to be able to take functions f: A -> B and g: C -> D and get some function f × g: A × C -> B × D
2013-12-30 06:19:25	Cale	and that's basically what a bifunctor is about
2013-12-30 06:19:26	startling	oh hey, that's an arrow thingy isn't it
2013-12-30 06:20:08	startling	it's (***), isn't it.
2013-12-30 06:20:13	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:20:20	startling	interesting.
2013-12-30 06:20:46	Cale	(In fact, I think Arrow needs to change to become closer to being defined as one of the things I'm about to properly define)
2013-12-30 06:21:02	startling	heh. maybe I'll understand the implications soon !

2013-12-30 06:21:59	Cale	So, we want a category C together with a bifunctor, which I'll call ⊗ and it needs to have a unit object I together with natural isomorphisms λ: I ⊗ A -> A (for every object A), and ρ: A ⊗ I -> A (also for every object A), and α: (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C -> A ⊗ (B ⊗ C)
2013-12-30 06:22:35	startling	I don't understand what "bifunctor" means in this sense.
2013-12-30 06:22:37	Cale	and it turns out we usually end up wanting some additional conditions on these isomorphisms
2013-12-30 06:22:46	Cale	A bifunctor is like a functor of two parameters
2013-12-30 06:23:01	Cale	i.e. it's really a functor C x C -> C
2013-12-30 06:23:03	startling	I've seen the typeclass but I don't know what it means here.
2013-12-30 06:23:18	Cale	It takes pairs of objects to objects
2013-12-30 06:23:23	Cale	and pairs of arrows to arrows
2013-12-30 06:23:27	startling	I don't know what 'functor' means here either. :/
2013-12-30 06:23:30	Cale	oh!
2013-12-30 06:23:43	Cale	Okay, so you should have some idea of what a category is, yeah?
2013-12-30 06:24:37	Cale	It has objects and arrows between the objects, and arrows that line up can be composed somehow, and there are identity arrows on every object, and composition is always associative whenever the composites make sense
2013-12-30 06:24:44	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:24:46	Cale	If C and D are two categories
2013-12-30 06:25:14	Cale	then a functor F: C -> D is a mapping which sends objects X in C to objects FX in D
2013-12-30 06:25:26	Cale	and sends arrows a: X -> Y in C to arrows Fa: FX -> FY in D
2013-12-30 06:25:31	startling	preserving things?
2013-12-30 06:25:40	Cale	such that F(id_X) = id_(FX) and F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2013-12-30 06:25:44	startling	so a "category morphism"?
2013-12-30 06:25:46	Cale	yes
2013-12-30 06:25:51	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:26:08	startling	oh, I see. so this is why #haskell always says "Haskell functors are endofunctors".
2013-12-30 06:26:13	Cale	yes
2013-12-30 06:26:23	Cale	They're functors Hask -> Hask
2013-12-30 06:26:28	startling	endofunctors = category automorphsms ?
2013-12-30 06:26:34	Cale	endomorphisms
2013-12-30 06:26:44	Cale	(automorphisms means they're invertible)
2013-12-30 06:27:03	startling	oh, alright.
2013-12-30 06:27:15	Cale	An endofunctor on C is just a functor C -> C
2013-12-30 06:27:19	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:27:21	Cale	(doesn't have to have an inverse)
2013-12-30 06:27:23	bennofs	I don't understand how you can replace the identity e of a monoid M with a function 1 -> M. Is it because if 1 only has one element, then the function can only map to one element in M (the unit)?
2013-12-30 06:27:30	Cale	right
2013-12-30 06:27:35	Cale	That's exactly how
2013-12-30 06:27:56	bennofs	So you basically "shot an arrow from another object (visually)" to mark the identity in M?
2013-12-30 06:28:02	Cale	For each element in M, there is exactly one function 1 -> M
2013-12-30 06:28:08	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:28:11	Cale	okay
2013-12-30 06:28:15	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:28:20	Cale	So, natural transformations...
2013-12-30 06:28:31	Cale	Suppose we have a pair of categories C and D
2013-12-30 06:28:40	Cale	and we have a pair of parallel functors F,G: C -> D
2013-12-30 06:28:49	startling	ok.
2013-12-30 06:29:44	-->	Guest98276 (~Pedro@201.81.180.241) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-30 06:29:47	Cale	You can sort of think of a functor F: C -> D as being like a "sketch" of C sitting in the category D. The picture of C might have been squashed down a bunch, but commutative diagrams will be sent to commutative diagrams
2013-12-30 06:30:05	startling	Cale, I really appreciate you taking your time to explain this, but I'm going to have to leave in ~5 minutes. Considering I don't even know what a monad is yet, would now be a good time to stop?
2013-12-30 06:30:16	Cale	Well, sure
2013-12-30 06:30:21	Cale	Well
2013-12-30 06:30:29	Cale	I'll give you a quick idea
2013-12-30 06:30:34	startling	Sure.
2013-12-30 06:30:35	Cale	of where we'd go with this
2013-12-30 06:30:45	Cale	There's a category of endofunctors C -> C
2013-12-30 06:31:01	Cale	i.e. its objects are endofunctors, and its arrows are natural transformations between those
2013-12-30 06:31:05	startling	oh, interesting.
2013-12-30 06:31:14	Cale	and we can make it into a monoidal category
2013-12-30 06:31:22	Cale	with ⊗ being composition of functors
2013-12-30 06:31:26	Cale	and I being the identity functor
2013-12-30 06:31:41	startling	monoidal categories are what we were talking about earlier, generalized away from Set?
2013-12-30 06:31:46	Cale	the isomorphisms λ,ρ,α are all the identity
2013-12-30 06:31:48	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:32:01	startling	interesting.
2013-12-30 06:32:16	Cale	A monoidal category is a category that comes with this extra machinery for combining objects analogously to what we had with Cartesian products
2013-12-30 06:32:40	startling	yeah.
2013-12-30 06:32:46	Cale	So, when we transplant the notion of a monoid from Set to this category of endofunctors, we'll end up with *exactly* the definition of a monad.
2013-12-30 06:32:51	Cale	including the laws
2013-12-30 06:32:59	startling	oh, neat.
2013-12-30 06:33:14	Cale	You can think of natural transformations as being analogous to polymorphic functions
2013-12-30 06:33:24	Cale	Our multiplication M . M -> M
2013-12-30 06:33:34	Cale	(natural transformation)
2013-12-30 06:33:44	Cale	will be represented in Haskell as a function M (M a) -> M a
2013-12-30 06:33:53	Cale	and our unit 1 -> M
2013-12-30 06:34:02	Cale	will be represented in Haskell as a function a -> M a
2013-12-30 06:34:09	Cale	and those are join and return, respectively
2013-12-30 06:34:10	startling	oh, neat.
2013-12-30 06:34:33	startling	"monoids in the category of endofunctors", indeed.
2013-12-30 06:34:37	Cale	yeah
2013-12-30 06:34:55	startling	interesting to have that finally make sense. :)
2013-12-30 06:34:58	Cale	and of course, this lets us transplant the definition of monoid into other categories
2013-12-30 06:35:07	startling	sure.
2013-12-30 06:35:34	Cale	If we transplant monoids into the category of vector spaces with tensor product as the operation on objects, and the field as the I for that

2013-12-30 06:40:40	bennofs	Is the structure of the objects in category theory important? It seems to me that I could just replace the objects with "labels" that have no real value, they only serve as a way to know which arrows I can compose.

2013-12-31 17:34:50	augur	dleedev: maybe ask in here
2013-12-31 17:37:43	dleedev	augur: if the objects are types, and not the values of types, how can functions be the morphisms, since morphisms are supposed to link type to type, not value to value
2013-12-31 17:37:44	dleedev	augur: C-objects in the Hask category are {String, Int, Bool, etc...}, right?
2013-12-31 17:38:07	augur	dleedev: its just by definition
2013-12-31 17:38:22	augur	dleedev: remember, i can define objects and arrows to be whatever i want
2013-12-31 17:38:30	augur	for instance, here's a whacky category:
2013-12-31 17:38:39	augur	let the objects be the letters of the alphabet
2013-12-31 17:39:21	augur	and Ar(l1,l2) = {bessy the cow} for any letters l1 and l2
2013-12-31 17:39:34	augur	where composition takes bessy the cow and bessy the cow to bessy the cow
2013-12-31 17:40:35	augur	there's nothing deep to objects and arrows, dleedev
2013-12-31 17:40:39	augur	objects are just a bunch of things
2013-12-31 17:40:48	Cale	Or we could take the arrows l1 -> l2 to be all the strings beginning with l1 and ending with l2, and take composition to be concatenation
2013-12-31 17:40:52	augur	arrows are also just a bunch of things, but they happen to be things-associated-with-two-other-things
2013-12-31 17:41:21	augur	you just have to make sure that the way you define these associations cohere according to the category laws
2013-12-31 17:41:27	dleedev	so let's take concrete examples from the Hask category
2013-12-31 17:41:31	dleedev	We have String and Int
2013-12-31 17:41:36	Cale	sure
2013-12-31 17:41:38	dleedev	what would be Ar(String, Int)?
2013-12-31 17:41:46	Cale	All the functions of type String -> Int
2013-12-31 17:42:00	augur	sometimes you also get Ar written as Hom
2013-12-31 17:42:03	Cale	Including for instance, length
2013-12-31 17:42:06	augur	just fyi
2013-12-31 17:42:10	dleedev	so an arrow could also be a collection of things (namely, collection of functions)?
2013-12-31 17:42:17	augur	no no
2013-12-31 17:42:23	augur	Ar(String,Int) is the collection
2013-12-31 17:42:29	Cale	dleedev: There's a collection of arrows between any pair of objects
2013-12-31 17:42:30	augur	an arrow is something in that collection
2013-12-31 17:42:52	dleedev	ok, that makes things much clearer
2013-12-31 17:42:57	Cale	So each arrow in Hask is a function
2013-12-31 17:43:07	augur	dleedev: so im going to repeat what Cale said probably but
2013-12-31 17:43:19	augur	a category C is a collection Ob(C) of objects
2013-12-31 17:43:24	augur	whatever you like, i dont care
2013-12-31 17:43:33	dleedev	so I just read this: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory
2013-12-31 17:43:46	Cale	dleedev: Did you grab that book I linked?
2013-12-31 17:43:46	augur	and for each X and Y in Ob(C), a collection Ar(X,Y) of arrows
2013-12-31 17:43:54	augur	whatever you like, i dont care
2013-12-31 17:44:00	augur	satisfying a bunch of junk
2013-12-31 17:44:10	augur	the crucial thing is the "whatever you like, i dont care"
2013-12-31 17:44:10	dleedev	Cale: I did
2013-12-31 17:44:29	augur	dleedev: a common example of a category is this:
2013-12-31 17:44:31	dleedev	In the wikibooks article, there's a section that says "If we add another morphism to the above example, it fails to be a category."
2013-12-31 17:44:35	Cale	So, if you look starting at the middle of page 4, it has the definition of a category
2013-12-31 17:44:39	augur	let C be the following category:
2013-12-31 17:44:49	augur	Ob(C) = the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... etc
2013-12-31 17:45:04	Cale	(I guess it's actually the 14th page counting all the front matter)
2013-12-31 17:45:43	augur	for any two numbers m and n, Ar(m,n) contains exactly one object (lets call it *, i dont care what it is, maybe its just the asterisk symbol!) if m <= n
2013-12-31 17:45:49	augur	and nothing else otherwise
2013-12-31 17:46:12	Cale	Another notation you may see in some places is C(A,B) for the collection of arrows of the category C from the object A to the object B
2013-12-31 17:46:13	augur	dleedev: does that make sense?
2013-12-31 17:46:16	dleedev	augur: ok
2013-12-31 17:46:30	Cale	(I personally prefer that notation most of the time)
2013-12-31 17:46:56	augur	dleedev: and now we just have to define id and composition but thats easy
2013-12-31 17:47:06	augur	id at a number m is just *
2013-12-31 17:47:40	dleedev	augur: is it the same *, or (* subscript m) ?
2013-12-31 17:47:44	augur	and given, f in Ar(m,n) and g in Ar(n,o), define g.f (or f;g depending on notational preference) to ne *
2013-12-31 17:48:05	augur	dleedev: same *, but you can subscript it if you like, by both numbers, in which case you might as well just say the arrow is the pair of numbers
2013-12-31 17:48:15	dleedev	Is the * in Ar(m,n) the same as the * in Ar(n,o)?
2013-12-31 17:48:26	Cale	dleedev: It can be
2013-12-31 17:48:37	augur	sure, if you define it the way i did, its just asterisk
2013-12-31 17:48:41	Cale	dleedev: It's up to us, and the difference between those options is not a big deal
2013-12-31 17:48:41	dleedev	So an arrow can be shared between pairs?
2013-12-31 17:48:50	augur	sure
2013-12-31 17:48:54	augur	an arrow is just a thing
2013-12-31 17:48:56	augur	whatever that thing is
2013-12-31 17:49:06	Cale	dleedev: Some people like all the sets of arrows between distinct pairs of objects to be disjoint
2013-12-31 17:49:08	augur	and its up to you to decide what the things are
2013-12-31 17:49:12	Cale	Some people don't worry about that
2013-12-31 17:49:21	augur	the only thing that is required is that the category laws hold
2013-12-31 17:49:21	dleedev	can you take a look at the wikibooks article I linked to?
2013-12-31 17:49:25	dleedev	search for "If we add another morphism to the above example, it fails to be a category."
2013-12-31 17:49:34	augur	sure
2013-12-31 17:49:56	dleedev	why does adding a second arrow between a pair of objects make it not a category?
2013-12-31 17:50:36	Cale	Well, let's think about the composites
2013-12-31 17:50:49	augur	well first lets be clear about what these pictures are supposed to be doing

2013-12-31 17:51:24	dleedev	augur: I assumed circles are objects and lines are morphisms
2013-12-31 17:51:26	augur	the intention of this diagram: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/2/26/Composition-ex.png
2013-12-31 17:51:38	augur	is that it is supposed to be showing you _everything_ in the category

2013-12-31 17:52:02	dleedev	btw, the diagram I wanted you to see was: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Not-a-cat.png
2013-12-31 17:52:03	augur	its just some random category that they're invention with two objects and two non-id arrows
2013-12-31 17:52:07	augur	dleedev: yes i know
2013-12-31 17:52:13	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 17:52:15	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 17:52:22	Cale	Let's consider f . g
2013-12-31 17:52:22	augur	so what this diagram is supposed to be saying is that you have _exactly four_ arrows in this category
2013-12-31 17:52:29	Cale	f . g : A -> A
2013-12-31 17:52:31	augur	id_A, id_B, f, and g
2013-12-31 17:52:32	augur	thats it
2013-12-31 17:52:37	Cale	But there's only one arrow A -> A, which is id_A
2013-12-31 17:52:38	augur	those are all the arrows in the category, full stop
2013-12-31 17:52:58	Cale	similarly, g . h : B -> B
2013-12-31 17:53:01	augur	Cale: hold on, i want to be precise about this
2013-12-31 17:53:06	Cale	but there's only one arrow B -> B which is id_B
2013-12-31 17:53:10	augur	so dleedev:   Ob = {A,B}
2013-12-31 17:53:20	Cale	So we know that f . g = id_A and we know that g . h = id_B
2013-12-31 17:53:39	augur	Ar(A,A) = { id_A }   Ar(B,B) = { id_B }   Ar(A,B) = { g }   Ar(B,A) = { f }
2013-12-31 17:53:40	augur	ok dleedev?
2013-12-31 17:53:46	Cale	and now we have that f . (g . h) = f . id_B = f
2013-12-31 17:53:48	dleedev	augur: yes
2013-12-31 17:53:54	Cale	but (f . g) . h = id_A . h = h
2013-12-31 17:53:56	augur	ok, so now consider what cale is saying :P
2013-12-31 17:54:25	Cale	but (f . g) . h was supposed to be equal to f . (g . h) for this to be a category
2013-12-31 17:54:35	augur	and keep in mind that writing   x : Y -> Z   is another way of saying   x is in Ar(Y,Z)
2013-12-31 17:55:58	Cale	(however, f is not intended to be equal to h here)
2013-12-31 17:56:18	augur	yes thats another thing i shouldve mentioned
2013-12-31 17:56:32	augur	by showing A and B, and f and g, these are supposed to be different things
2013-12-31 17:56:52	augur	which is not necessarily true of diagrams in general
2013-12-31 17:57:12	augur	these pictures have a very special purpose on this wikibooks page
2013-12-31 17:57:40	Cale	I don't really like this wikibook presentation, and I think this example is a bit of a weird question, though I guess it does force you to get certain ideas straight.
2013-12-31 17:58:05	augur	i prefer catsters' presentation
2013-12-31 17:58:10	augur	and i think maybe awodey's too?
2013-12-31 17:58:12	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 17:58:14	augur	being very explicit
2013-12-31 17:58:20	augur	what are you objects
2013-12-31 17:58:22	augur	what are your morphisms
2013-12-31 17:58:27	augur	what is identity and what is composition
2013-12-31 17:58:48	augur	being extremely explicit about these things is important
2013-12-31 17:58:53	augur	at least initially
2013-12-31 17:59:22	Cale	dleedev: So, as you were leaving before, I'm not sure I got it across, but I gave a big class of examples of categories.
2013-12-31 17:59:28	Cale	I'll repeat that bit :)
2013-12-31 17:59:45	dleedev	Cale: sure
2013-12-31 17:59:49	augur	really you should watch awodey's lectures. he gives a lot of examples too, i think
2013-12-31 18:00:01	augur	and the more examples the better
2013-12-31 18:00:07	augur	and also awodey was funny
2013-12-31 18:00:18	augur	((unlike Cale))
2013-12-31 18:00:31	augur	:X
2013-12-31 18:00:43	Cale	Recall that a monoid consists of a set M together with some multiplication operation *: M x M -> M, which is associative (i.e. for all a,b,c in M, we have a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c), and which has an identity (i.e. there is some 1 in M such that for any a in M, we have 1 * a = a = a * 1)
2013-12-31 18:01:01	Cale	If we start with a monoid, we can turn it into a category
2013-12-31 18:01:23	Cale	We give our category just a single object. I'll call that object X just for the sake of having a name.
2013-12-31 18:01:45	augur	M is another popular name for that object
2013-12-31 18:01:46	Cale	and the set of arrows X -> X will be the elements of M
2013-12-31 18:01:48	dleedev	btw, thanks for explaining the wikibooks diagram, I now understand why adding that second morphism makes the diagram no longer a category
2013-12-31 18:01:59	Cale	Well, I don't want to be confusing
2013-12-31 18:02:16	Cale	cool
2013-12-31 18:02:41	Cale	So, M is our set of arrows X -> X, and we define composition as multiplication, and id_X = 1
2013-12-31 18:03:00	dleedev	by M x M, do you mean M * M?
2013-12-31 18:03:13	Cale	I mean the set of all ordered pairs of elements of M
2013-12-31 18:03:25	Cale	A x B = {(a,b) : a in A, b in B}
2013-12-31 18:03:43	Cale	i.e. the Cartesian product
2013-12-31 18:03:44	dleedev	is that a cartesian product?
2013-12-31 18:03:46	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 18:04:18	Cale	i.e. multiplication takes an ordered pair of elements of M and gives us some element of M
2013-12-31 18:04:30	Cale	and instead of writing *(a,b) we usually write a*b
2013-12-31 18:04:42	dleedev	I see, why didn't you write M -> M -> M?
2013-12-31 18:04:59	Cale	Well, because I'm giving a traditional definition, rather than a Haskell oriented one.
2013-12-31 18:05:05	augur	mathematicians are afraid of having too many arrows
2013-12-31 18:05:44	Cale	I certainly could have. If we get on to that monoid object stuff later, then the reason for this particular way of defining things will be clearer
2013-12-31 18:05:49	augur	arrophobia is a common phobia among mathematicians, hence the slow uptake of category theory
2013-12-31 18:06:00	Cale	(That x for Cartesian product will become a different operation)
2013-12-31 18:06:17	Cale	heh
2013-12-31 18:06:22	Cale	I'm not sure I'd agree about that
2013-12-31 18:06:33	augur	it was a joke, Cale :P
2013-12-31 18:07:18	dleedev	so monoids are endofunctors?
2013-12-31 18:07:21	Cale	(I'd also say that CT has had a pretty rapid uptake, as far as it's become ingrained in the notation in every field of mathematics in the last 50 years)
2013-12-31 18:07:33	Cale	I haven't defined functors
2013-12-31 18:07:35	Cale	and no
2013-12-31 18:07:51	augur	Cale: you're taking a joke seriously
2013-12-31 18:07:52	dleedev	mono ids are arrows
2013-12-31 18:08:02	augur	mono ids?
2013-12-31 18:08:17	dleedev	monoids :)
2013-12-31 18:08:21	augur	oh lol
2013-12-31 18:08:29	Cale	augur: I realise that you're joking, but you and I might know things that dleedev doesn't :)
2013-12-31 18:08:44	augur	no monoids are a special kind of category, was Cale is trying to explain
2013-12-31 18:08:53	Cale	(and some people do say things like that without joking)
2013-12-31 18:09:26	dleedev	Monoids are a category where objects are arrows in M?
2013-12-31 18:09:41	augur	no no
2013-12-31 18:09:44	Cale	Monoids are categories with just one object
2013-12-31 18:09:50	dleedev	oops, not M, X
2013-12-31 18:09:50	Cale	and a set of arrows from that object to itself
2013-12-31 18:09:51	augur	so hold on
2013-12-31 18:10:01	Cale	"are"
2013-12-31 18:10:03	augur	lets be clear, the definition hasnt been given yet
2013-12-31 18:10:08	dleedev	oh, ok
2013-12-31 18:10:11	Cale	There's an easy correspondence back and forth
2013-12-31 18:10:18	augur	not quite.
2013-12-31 18:10:24	augur	i mean, it hasnt quite been given
2013-12-31 18:10:35	augur	first, you get what a monoid is, yes dleedev?
2013-12-31 18:10:53	dleedev	augur: in the practical sense, yes
2013-12-31 18:10:58	Cale	Given any category with just one object and a set of arrows from that object to itself, we can form a monoid by taking M in the definition of a monoid to be that set of arrows
2013-12-31 18:11:10	augur	so lets specify: if M is your set of elements, and * is your monoid operation with unit 1
2013-12-31 18:11:11	Cale	and the multiplication to be the composition of arrows
2013-12-31 18:11:19	dleedev	augur: basically, a type that you can `mappend` unto itself
2013-12-31 18:11:21	Cale	i.e. a * b = a . b
2013-12-31 18:11:30	Cale	dleedev: and mempty
2013-12-31 18:11:34	augur	then we define MonCat(M) as follows:
2013-12-31 18:11:35	Cale	and it's associative
2013-12-31 18:11:43	Cale	and mempty is an identity for mappend
2013-12-31 18:11:47	augur	the objects of MonCat(M) = {X}   just this one random object X
2013-12-31 18:12:09	augur	since there's only one object, we only need to define Ar(X,X)
2013-12-31 18:12:19	augur	so: Ar(X,X) = { the elements of the set M }
2013-12-31 18:12:29	Cale	Or Ar(X,X) = M
2013-12-31 18:12:32	augur	right
2013-12-31 18:12:46	augur	now we have to specify: id_X = 1 (which is an element of M)
2013-12-31 18:13:16	augur	and if f and g are both in Ar(X,X), f.g is defined as f*g
2013-12-31 18:13:48	Cale	This composition will be associative because the monoid multiplication is associative
2013-12-31 18:14:05	augur	thus for example, here's a fun monoid: lists of numbers, with [] as the identity element, and append (++) as the monoid operation
2013-12-31 18:14:06	Cale	and id_X will be an identity for composition, because 1 was an identity for multiplication
2013-12-31 18:14:52	dleedev	so the objects of a monoid category are arrows in another single-object category?
2013-12-31 18:14:53	augur	thus, [4,5,7,6,7,5] is a list of numbers, so it's an element of Ar(X,X) for the Lists Of Numbers monoid
2013-12-31 18:15:03	augur	no no
2013-12-31 18:15:13	<--	echo-area (~user@182.92.247.2) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-31 18:15:18	Cale	dleedev: There's just one object in the category we're defining
2013-12-31 18:15:43	Cale	(We've been calling it X, but you could call it whatever you want, the name is especially unimportant when there's only one)
2013-12-31 18:15:49	augur	dleedev: if M is the monoid, and MonCat(M) is the associated category, there is only one object in MonCat(M)
2013-12-31 18:15:55	augur	which we're calling X
2013-12-31 18:16:20	dleedev	"we can form a monoid by taking M in the definition of a monoid to be that set of arrows"
2013-12-31 18:16:28	dleedev	"M is the set of arrows"
2013-12-31 18:16:43	augur	who said this?
2013-12-31 18:17:12	dleedev	I'm interpreting "we can form a monoid by taking M in the definition of a monoid to be that set of arrows" to mean "M [is]... that set of arrows"
2013-12-31 18:17:19	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 18:17:23	Cale	That's correct
2013-12-31 18:17:30	dleedev	So M is a set of arrows?
2013-12-31 18:17:32	Cale	M is the set of arrows X -> X in this category
2013-12-31 18:17:44	Cale	We're defining the arrows X -> X to be that set M
2013-12-31 18:17:52	augur	observe that word:
2013-12-31 18:17:55	augur	were DEFINING
2013-12-31 18:17:58	augur	the arrows
2013-12-31 18:18:06	dleedev	and that set M is the objects of the monoid category?
2013-12-31 18:18:09	augur	no
2013-12-31 18:18:10	Cale	no
2013-12-31 18:18:22	Cale	The set of objects is just {X}
2013-12-31 18:18:22	dleedev	then where's that set used?
2013-12-31 18:18:33	augur	dleedev: its the arrows!
2013-12-31 18:18:37	augur	Ar(X,X) = M
2013-12-31 18:18:41	Cale	Remember that between any pair of objects of our category, we need to provide a collection of arrows
2013-12-31 18:18:54	Cale	Since there's only one object, namely X
2013-12-31 18:19:05	Cale	we only have one pair of objects (X,X)
2013-12-31 18:19:16	Cale	and so there's just one collection of arrows we need to provide
2013-12-31 18:19:23	dleedev	but M is also a set of objects: "M x M -> M"
2013-12-31 18:19:26	Cale	and we're providing the set M as that collection
2013-12-31 18:19:27	augur	no
2013-12-31 18:19:35	dleedev	has the meaning of M changed?
2013-12-31 18:19:36	Cale	M is a set of elements of this monoid
2013-12-31 18:19:38	augur	M is not a set of objects M x M -> M
2013-12-31 18:19:47	augur	where did you get this idea?
2013-12-31 18:19:47	dleedev	M is a set of elements!
2013-12-31 18:19:53	augur	yes, a set of elements!
2013-12-31 18:20:01	dleedev	at the same time a set of arrows
2013-12-31 18:20:05	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 18:20:06	augur	yes
2013-12-31 18:20:17	augur	because "arrow" is just a name
2013-12-31 18:20:20	augur	it doesnt mean anything special
2013-12-31 18:20:25	Cale	Well, we're making the arrows from X to X in this category be the elements of the set M
2013-12-31 18:20:32	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 18:20:40	dleedev	so what's the category where M is the set of elements?
2013-12-31 18:20:41	zett_zelett	In the category-theoretic view, the binary operation M × M → M of the monoid M is just arrow composition f g ↦ f · g.
2013-12-31 18:20:46	Cale	We're defining the category, we get to decide what the objects are, what the arrows are, and how composition works
2013-12-31 18:20:55	augur	zett_zelett: no shh
2013-12-31 18:20:58	Cale	and then we have to check that composition is associative, and that there are identity arrows
2013-12-31 18:21:11	augur	dleedev: who knows, who cares
2013-12-31 18:21:12	zett_zelett	augur: Why?
2013-12-31 18:21:14	Cale	and if we succeed in that checking, we have correctly defined a new category
2013-12-31 18:21:19	zett_zelett	augur: I’m pretty sure, that’s true.
2013-12-31 18:21:25	augur	dleedev: you'd have to INVENT some category where M is the objects
2013-12-31 18:21:40	augur	zett_zelett: true and helpful arent the same thing :P
2013-12-31 18:21:47	Cale	dleedev: We could make a bunch of them in lots of different ways
2013-12-31 18:22:03	augur	dleedev: remember, we're _Defining_
2013-12-31 18:22:05	Cale	dleedev: But that's not the category we're trying to talk about :)
2013-12-31 18:22:05	zett_zelett	augur: I thought that was the confusion, sorry.
2013-12-31 18:22:05	dleedev	"Recall that a monoid consists of a set M together with some multiplication operation *: M x M -> M, which is associative (i.e. for all a,b,c in M, we have a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c), and which has an identity (i.e. there is some 1 in M such that for any a in M, we have 1 * a = a = a * 1)"
2013-12-31 18:22:23	dleedev	we're talking about the same M from that sentence, right?
2013-12-31 18:22:28	augur	yes
2013-12-31 18:22:29	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 18:22:38	Cale	So, suppose we have any monoid M whatsoever
2013-12-31 18:22:48	Cale	If you like, you can pick a specific one
2013-12-31 18:22:49	augur	i think examples are good
2013-12-31 18:22:54	Cale	Like the natural numbers under addition
2013-12-31 18:23:01	Cale	with the "1" being 0
2013-12-31 18:23:10	augur	eugh
2013-12-31 18:23:13	augur	can we pick something else
2013-12-31 18:23:15	augur	thats confusing
2013-12-31 18:23:16	Cale	Or perhaps the real numbers under multiplication
2013-12-31 18:23:18	zett_zelett	Why not multiplication?
2013-12-31 18:23:19	augur	lets pick strings
2013-12-31 18:23:20	zett_zelett	Yeah.
2013-12-31 18:23:21	zett_zelett	C’mon.
2013-12-31 18:23:32	dleedev	OK, I get that
2013-12-31 18:23:33	augur	or reals under multiplication
2013-12-31 18:23:36	zett_zelett	(ℕ,1,·)
2013-12-31 18:23:48	augur	just not addition, because thats confusing
2013-12-31 18:23:59	Cale	Well, it's good to be clear that the "1" in the definition doesn't *literally* have to be 1
2013-12-31 18:24:00	dleedev	so what is a "Monoid"? Is it the same of a category? The name of a function? The name of a functor?
2013-12-31 18:24:12	ocharles	only in ##categorytheory would we hear addition is confusing ;)
2013-12-31 18:24:14	augur	Cale: yes, but it wouldve been better to chose a different name :X
2013-12-31 18:24:19	augur	ocharles: :D
2013-12-31 18:24:34	Cale	dleedev: I gave the full definition of a monoid in the text that you copy pasted there
2013-12-31 18:24:39	Cale	a monoid consists of a set M together with some multiplication operation *: M x M -> M, which is associative (i.e. for all a,b,c in M, we have a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c), and which has an identity (i.e. there is some 1 in M such that for any a in M, we have 1 * a = a = a * 1)
2013-12-31 18:24:42	augur	dleedev: A Monoid is that thing
2013-12-31 18:25:04	Cale	A monoid is *any* set together with *any* function * which satisfies those conditions
2013-12-31 18:25:04	augur	"Mon" or "Monoid" or whatever could mean lots of other things depending on context. the "a" is important.
2013-12-31 18:25:10	dleedev	Monoid: a set + an operation
2013-12-31 18:25:17	augur	not quite
2013-12-31 18:25:26	augur	monoid: a set + an element + a binary operation
2013-12-31 18:25:26	dleedev	+ caveats
2013-12-31 18:25:30	augur	subject to certain laws
2013-12-31 18:25:32	Cale	dleedev: a set with an associative binary operation that has an identity
2013-12-31 18:25:34	augur	as described above
2013-12-31 18:25:44	zett_zelett	A monoid is the whole structure M = (M,·,1), so the whole package of a set of elements (or arrows in the category-theoretic view), the neutral element 1 (or the identity 1 or id in the category-theoretic view) and the binary, associativie operation · (which is arrow composition in the category-theoretic view) is the monoid.
2013-12-31 18:25:55	zett_zelett	All of that as one thing to think of.
2013-12-31 18:25:58	zett_zelett	Is a monoid.
2013-12-31 18:26:02	augur	yes.
2013-12-31 18:26:20	dleedev	a monoid consists of a set of arrows?
2013-12-31 18:26:25	augur	no
2013-12-31 18:26:31	augur	a monoid is just what zett_zelett just said
2013-12-31 18:26:34	dleedev	but M is a set of arrows
2013-12-31 18:26:35	zett_zelett	If you want to think about it that way.
2013-12-31 18:26:42	augur	dleedev: yes
2013-12-31 18:26:51	Cale	dleedev: That's for the construction of the category we were building
2013-12-31 18:26:51	zett_zelett	It’s not just the mere set though.
2013-12-31 18:26:58	augur	zett_zelett is conflating
2013-12-31 18:27:07	Cale	dleedev: Given some monoid M, we can make a category which is in some sense "equivalent" to M
2013-12-31 18:27:09	augur	which is naughty of him/her/them to do
2013-12-31 18:27:18	zett_zelett	Him, and sorry.
2013-12-31 18:27:21	augur	the monoid is (M,*,1)
2013-12-31 18:27:32	augur	the TRIPLE of things
2013-12-31 18:27:32	zett_zelett	I thought I separated it clearly by using parantheses.
2013-12-31 18:27:41	Cale	dleedev: That category will have one object, and the arrows from that object to itself will be the elements of M
2013-12-31 18:27:41	augur	zett_zelett: yes but you used M twice which is confusing
2013-12-31 18:28:25	augur	dleedev: i really cant stress the word "define" enough
2013-12-31 18:28:30	Cale	dleedev: and the composition of those arrows will be the monoid operation
2013-12-31 18:28:35	zett_zelett	Yeah, I should explain how I meant that: We colloquially say that "M" is a monoid. Just as "The natural numbers form a monoid.", but we really think of the operation and of the identity as well when we say that.
2013-12-31 18:28:45	Cale	dleedev: and the identity arrow will be the identity of the monoid
2013-12-31 18:28:59	dleedev	How does this sound: A monoid consists of a set M, with a binary associative operator M -> M -> M, and an identity, where M is a set of arrows in a Category of one object.
2013-12-31 18:29:14	Cale	dleedev: M is just an arbitrary set
2013-12-31 18:29:35	Cale	dleedev: You're getting confused by mixing in the construction which comes later
2013-12-31 18:30:09	Cale	dleedev: "A monoid consists of a set M, with a binary associative operator M -> M -> M, and an identity"
2013-12-31 18:30:14	Cale	that's fine on its own
2013-12-31 18:30:31	dleedev	but you said "Ar(X,X) = M"
2013-12-31 18:30:34	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 18:30:42	Cale	because we were defining a new category there
2013-12-31 18:30:46	Cale	and we get to pick what the arrows are
2013-12-31 18:30:52	Cale	so I made them be the elements of M
2013-12-31 18:30:57	Cale	M already existed as a monoid
2013-12-31 18:31:18	Cale	I was building a category, and it came time to pick what this set of arrows from X to X was
2013-12-31 18:31:22	Cale	and I picked it to be the set M
2013-12-31 18:31:49	dleedev	OK, so X has nothing to do with helping someone understand what monoids are?
2013-12-31 18:31:56	Cale	Right
2013-12-31 18:32:05	dleedev	Cale: that makes so much more sense
2013-12-31 18:32:15	Cale	X was the one object of our newly constructed category
2013-12-31 18:32:17	dleedev	I was wondering how X fit into the definition of a monoid
2013-12-31 18:32:36	Cale	We're starting with a monoid M, and making a new category from it
2013-12-31 18:32:46	dleedev	I thought you were continuing with your definition of monoid M
2013-12-31 18:32:50	Cale	ah, okay
2013-12-31 18:32:57	dleedev	that was a large detour
2013-12-31 18:33:01	dleedev	ok, back on track
2013-12-31 18:33:27	Cale	okay, so to make this category, we have to say what the arrows from X to X are
2013-12-31 18:33:28	dleedev	you are creating a new category with Ob(C) = {X}
2013-12-31 18:33:32	Cale	yep
2013-12-31 18:33:47	Cale	and I'm saying the arrows from X to X are just the elements of M
2013-12-31 18:33:59	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 18:34:00	Cale	and then I have to say how to compose them
2013-12-31 18:34:16	-->	aloiscochard (uid2076@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-uzmxextengwodxig) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-31 18:34:35	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 18:34:42	Cale	So if we have f: X -> X and g: X -> X, well, f and g will already be elements of M, and so we can take f * g which will again be an element of M, and so it will also be an arrow X -> X per our definition
2013-12-31 18:35:08	Cale	and we can define the composition of the arrows f . g to be f * g
2013-12-31 18:35:39	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 18:36:09	Cale	This composition will be associative, because if f, g, h are arrows, we'll have f . (g . h) = f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h = (f . g) . h -- using the associativity of the monoid * and our definition of composition
2013-12-31 18:36:44	augur	the first and last = there are rather different than the middle on, fwiw
2013-12-31 18:36:56	Cale	Moreover, remember we need to ensure that there's an arrow id_X: X -> X which when composed with any other arrow leaves it unchanged
2013-12-31 18:37:00	dleedev	is this proving that the arrows of a 1-element category must be monoids?
2013-12-31 18:37:26	Cale	dleedev: The other way around, but we'll get to the case of extracting a monoid from a one object category
2013-12-31 18:37:27	augur	no, dleedev, this is just telling you how to build a category form a monoid
2013-12-31 18:37:33	zett_zelett	A monoid is a structure.
2013-12-31 18:37:36	zett_zelett	A category is a structure.
2013-12-31 18:37:49	zett_zelett	Every monoid can be seen as a category.
2013-12-31 18:37:58	zett_zelett	It’s just a view point.
2013-12-31 18:38:44	zett_zelett	However, think of a monoid as something like "the structure of the natural numbers with 1 and multiplication" or "the structure of strings with [] and ++" and so on.
2013-12-31 18:39:24	Cale	dleedev: Remember that part of the definition of a category was that the composition is associative
2013-12-31 18:39:34	Cale	dleedev: Just like how the multiplication of a monoid needs to be associative
2013-12-31 18:40:14	dleedev	Cale: yes
2013-12-31 18:40:17	Cale	dleedev: What my little chain of equations was doing there is checking that f . (g . h) = (f . g) . h, i.e. that our composition is associative
2013-12-31 18:40:27	Cale	(because the multiplication of the monoid we started with was)
2013-12-31 18:40:38	augur	can i just say, i think its bad to give examples of a new notion (category) using examples of a new notion (monoid)
2013-12-31 18:40:42	Cale	Also, we need to make sure there's an identity arrow
2013-12-31 18:40:55	Cale	Well, yes, perhaps :)
2013-12-31 18:41:01	dleedev	Cale: aren't all arrows ID arrows?
2013-12-31 18:41:05	Cale	no!
2013-12-31 18:41:22	Cale	They're all arrows X -> X, like the identity arrow
2013-12-31 18:41:42	dleedev	X -> X does not mean identity arrow?
2013-12-31 18:41:46	Cale	but only one of them will have the property that id_X . f = f for any f, and f . id_X = f for any f
2013-12-31 18:41:57	-->	bishboria (uid19122@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-kxecymfpwcijhzss) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-31 18:42:01	augur	dleedev: no!
2013-12-31 18:42:08	dleedev	ah, got it
2013-12-31 18:42:09	augur	X -> X means "an arrow that starts at X and goes to X"
2013-12-31 18:42:10	Cale	This id_X will be our identity arrow on X
2013-12-31 18:42:31	Cale	dleedev: Remember with sets and functions, there are lots of functions Integer -> Integer, but only one identity function.
2013-12-31 18:42:56	augur	dleedev: the id_X arrow is a special arrow id_X : X -> X which has the property that it _doesn't do anything funny when you compose it with things_
2013-12-31 18:42:58	Cale	cool?
2013-12-31 18:43:32	dleedev	btw, in haskell, what do you call an instance of a type?
2013-12-31 18:43:33	augur	and by "funny" what i really mean is "doesnt do anything at all"
2013-12-31 18:43:36	Cale	and we are in fact, guaranteed that such a candidate for id_X will exist, namely the identity of our monoid
2013-12-31 18:43:40	dleedev	for example, 1, 2, 3 are instances of Integer
2013-12-31 18:43:45	Cale	So we can define id_X = 1
2013-12-31 18:43:46	augur	dleedev: inhabitants, i would say
2013-12-31 18:43:57	zett_zelett	How about ‘value’?
2013-12-31 18:44:08	augur	thats not unreasonable either
2013-12-31 18:44:17	zett_zelett	Like 3 :: Int means ‘3 is a value of Int’.
2013-12-31 18:44:31	Cale	dleedev: Functions Integer -> Integer include things like multiplication by 2, taking the absolute value and adding all the digits together...
2013-12-31 18:44:49	zett_zelett	It fits nicely with the notion of value constructors.
2013-12-31 18:45:17	Cale	dleedev: The identity function though is just (\x -> x), it just gives back its argument unchanged.
2013-12-31 18:46:26	dleedev	Cale: ok, got it
2013-12-31 18:46:32	Cale	The category-theoretic thing which characterises an identity function is that when you compose it with any other function, it leaves that *function* unchanged
2013-12-31 18:46:51	Cale	and similarly, in our little one-object category
2013-12-31 18:46:55	Cale	we need an identity arrow
2013-12-31 18:47:04	Cale	our arrows X -> X are elements of M
2013-12-31 18:47:20	Cale	and our composition is multiplication according to the monoid M
2013-12-31 18:47:35	Cale	so we need an element of M such that when you multiply it with anything, it leaves that element unchanged
2013-12-31 18:47:48	Cale	and thankfully, that's part of the definition of what it means for M to be a monoid
2013-12-31 18:48:09	Cale	good?
2013-12-31 18:50:44	Cale	We can also turn around and do this the other way, starting with a one-object category with some set of arrows from that object to itself, a defining a monoid by taking the set M to be that set of arrows, and the multiplication to be composition, and it'll be associative because composition of arrows is associative, and it'll have an identity, because there's an identity arrow.
2013-12-31 18:50:55	Cale	and defining*
2013-12-31 18:51:53	Cale	Because we can go back and forth like this without losing anything, it's valid to think of monoids as being one-object categories and vice-versa, even though they're technically defined a little differently.
2013-12-31 18:52:57	Cale	Let me know when this is okay, or if you have more questions :)
2013-12-31 18:53:06	dleedev	this is good
2013-12-31 18:53:08	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 18:54:42	dleedev	is there a name for this concept, btw?
2013-12-31 18:54:43	augur	i think the hardest thing to grok here is that objects and arrows arent anything special or specific

2013-12-31 18:55:35	dleedev	is there a name for a theory/law that says that 1-object categories can be thought of as monoids & vice versa?
2013-12-31 18:55:48	Cale	dleedev: It's a funny sort of isomorphism.

2013-12-31 18:57:48	Cale	and more general in a way
2013-12-31 18:58:17	Cale	dleedev: So anyway, let's look at another class of examples of category
2013-12-31 18:58:28	dleedev	Cale: let's do it
2013-12-31 18:58:32	Cale	dleedev: We kind of have some sort of handle on what happens with just one object
2013-12-31 18:58:56	notdan	sorry for intervening, are you doing a live class session of some sort?
2013-12-31 18:58:59	Cale	Now we'll look at what happens if we have lots of objects, but only one arrow at most between any two?
2013-12-31 18:59:23	Cale	notdan: augur and I just introduced dleedev to the idea of a category earlier today
2013-12-31 18:59:35	Cale	So, I'm going over some introductory stuff
2013-12-31 18:59:46	augur	i was thoroughly against it
2013-12-31 18:59:51	Cale	hah
2013-12-31 19:00:07	dleedev	notdan: this started in #haskell, btw
2013-12-31 19:00:20	Cale	dleedev: Okay, so preorders :)
2013-12-31 19:00:59	dleedev	Cale: alright, preorders
2013-12-31 19:01:21	Cale	A preorder consists of a set S, together with a binary relation <= on it such that 1) It's reflexive: for any a in S, we have a <= a, and 2) It's transitive: for any a,b,c in S, if a <= b and b <= c then a <= c
2013-12-31 19:01:43	Cale	Basically any kind of thing which you'd usually think of as an ordering of any kind will satisfy these conditions
2013-12-31 19:02:04	Cale	So, e.g. the real numbers with their usual ordering do
2013-12-31 19:02:37	Cale	But also, if you know what a partial order is, those are also all examples of preorders
2013-12-31 19:03:13	dleedev	Cale: don't know what partial order is
2013-12-31 19:03:33	Cale	http://tartarus.org/simon/2008-olympics-hasse/ -- you can see here a diagram depicting a partial ordering on countries participating in the 2008 Olympics
2013-12-31 19:04:34	Cale	Where we say that one country X has certainly done better than another Y, if you can add and upgrade medals that Y won to get the medals that X won
2013-12-31 19:04:59	Cale	and that will leave some countries incomparable with each other
2013-12-31 19:05:12	Cale	but still provide some information about who did better than who
2013-12-31 19:05:54	Cale	(It's slightly unfortunate that the arrows in that diagram go the opposite direction from how I want them to go)
2013-12-31 19:06:12	dleedev	Cale: I get it now
2013-12-31 19:06:44	Cale	But yeah, given any preorder (S,<=), we can form a category whose objects are the elements of S
2013-12-31 19:06:57	Cale	and where there's exactly one arrow X -> Y whenever X <= Y
2013-12-31 19:07:05	Cale	and no arrow otherwise
2013-12-31 19:08:34	Cale	this leaves the questions about how to define compositions trivial, because there will only be just one choice of arrow -- and the arrow *will* be there, because if we have composable arrows f: Y -> Z and g: X -> Y, then that means Y <= Z and X <= Y respectively, so X <= Z by transitivity, and so there must be just one arrow X -> Z to be the composite
2013-12-31 19:09:38	Cale	Also, we need identity arrows for each object X, we need id_X: X -> X, and that arrow will exist by our definition because X <= X by the reflexivity condition
2013-12-31 19:10:42	Cale	(and its composites with other arrows won't change those arrows, somewhat trivially, because there's at most one arrow between any pair of objects)
2013-12-31 19:10:56	Cale	Cool?
2013-12-31 19:11:25	Cale	So we can use this to form a gigantic category whose objects are all the real numbers, and where there's an arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2013-12-31 19:12:05	Cale	Or we can turn that list of countries into a category (it'll look rather like the diagram, only the arrows will conventionally go the other way to start with)
2013-12-31 19:12:37	dleedev	Cale: so this is different from the previous talk about monoids, because in that example, arrows were functions that returned different values, yet pointed to the same category object
2013-12-31 19:12:39	Cale	also, the diagram on that website leaves out any arrow which is the composite of two others
2013-12-31 19:13:00	dleedev	because in the monoids talk, X was a type, and not a value
2013-12-31 19:13:00	Cale	Well, the *composition* was a function that returned different values
2013-12-31 19:13:52	Cale	From the point of view of category theory, the arrows are somewhat-inert things which composition acts on
2013-12-31 19:14:21	Cale	in our monoid example, the arrows weren't functions, but just elements of that set M, remember
2013-12-31 19:15:00	Cale	You could say that X was a value or a type in that example, but those aren't really terms of category theory :)
2013-12-31 19:15:19	Cale	(X was an object)
2013-12-31 19:15:36	dleedev	right, the weird thing was that X was an object that had many arrows that pointed to itself
2013-12-31 19:15:56	dleedev	any number of those arrows could be composited, and it would always point to X
2013-12-31 19:16:14	dleedev	but we specified that only one of those arrows could be an identity
2013-12-31 19:18:42	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 19:18:45	dleedev	so even though f * g points to X and g * f points to X, f is not necessarily an identity arrow
2013-12-31 19:18:55	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 19:19:14	dleedev	that's not weird?
2013-12-31 19:19:25	Cale	because f * g might work out to some third arrow h
2013-12-31 19:19:39	Cale	rather than g, as it would have to be if f were the identity arrow
2013-12-31 19:20:29	dleedev	so arrows carry more information than simply X -> X
2013-12-31 19:20:41	Cale	We can have many arrows X -> X
2013-12-31 19:20:49	Cale	which are distinct from each other
2013-12-31 19:20:51	Cale	in general
2013-12-31 19:21:11	Cale	Right? The definition of a category says that there's some collection of arrows between any pair of objects
2013-12-31 19:21:48	dleedev	right, but it also says arrows are simply a link between a pair of objects
2013-12-31 19:21:52	dleedev	almost like a tuple
2013-12-31 19:21:57	dleedev	but it's more than a tuple
2013-12-31 19:22:00	Cale	So, if we were to draw a picture of our monoid category, it would have just that object X, and then many many loops X -> X
2013-12-31 19:22:11	Cale	(one for each element of M)
2013-12-31 19:22:17	dleedev	because there's a hidden quality about an arrow that makes it distinct from another arrow with the same "type signature"
2013-12-31 19:22:26	Cale	and then composing those loops with each other would give other loops somehow
2013-12-31 19:22:37	Cale	For example, let's look at the case where M = String
2013-12-31 19:22:41	Cale	and * = ++
2013-12-31 19:22:48	Cale	and 1 is the empty string
2013-12-31 19:22:58	dleedev	yes, but the point I'm trying to make is that arrows are not simply tuples
2013-12-31 19:23:05	Cale	yeah, that's correct :)
2013-12-31 19:23:17	Cale	Arrows are anything we want them to be
2013-12-31 19:23:43	dleedev	Cale: ok, that makes sense
2013-12-31 19:23:53	dleedev	Cale: let's continue with preorder
2013-12-31 19:23:56	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 19:24:16	Cale	So, well, I was almost done there. We get lots of new examples of categories from that
2013-12-31 19:24:32	dleedev	I have a pretty good picture of this country category
2013-12-31 19:24:36	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 19:25:02	Cale	You'll have to imagine the composite arrows from that picture, because he explicitly removed any arrow which was the composite of two others
2013-12-31 19:25:16	Cale	(because they clutter the diagram)
2013-12-31 19:25:37	dleedev	Cale: OK, I can imagine those
2013-12-31 19:25:46	Cale	Also, the identity arrows are missing
2013-12-31 19:26:06	Cale	But yeah
2013-12-31 19:26:11	Cale	that's a pretty good picture :)
2013-12-31 19:26:14	dleedev	btw, every arrow can be composited into a new arrow, right?
2013-12-31 19:26:24	dleedev	every 2 arrows*
2013-12-31 19:26:31	Cale	Every two arrows which line up head to tail can be composed
2013-12-31 19:26:42	dleedev	right
2013-12-31 19:26:53	Cale	Really, the job of the objects in a category is to help you know when it's okay to compose arrows
2013-12-31 19:27:19	Cale	(that's a bit funny to say in some cases, but it's mostly true)
2013-12-31 19:27:34	Cale	It's especially funny in these preorder examples
2013-12-31 19:27:43	dleedev	so is it correct to assume that a composition of one of the two original arrows and the result of the original composition equals the result of the original composition?
2013-12-31 19:28:07	Cale	Can you rephrase that?
2013-12-31 19:28:38	dleedev	an arrow A->B composited with an arrow B->C creates an arrow A->C
2013-12-31 19:28:50	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 19:29:03	dleedev	would the original A->B arrow composited with the resulting A->C arrow result in that latter A->C arrow?
2013-12-31 19:29:11	Cale	You can't compose those arrows
2013-12-31 19:29:31	dleedev	ah, right
2013-12-31 19:29:51	dleedev	what about in the one-object case
2013-12-31 19:30:08	Cale	In the one object case, all the arrows can be composed with each other
2013-12-31 19:30:08	dleedev	A1 composited with A2 results in A3
2013-12-31 19:30:24	Cale	because there's only one object, so the head of one arrow will always be the tail of the next
2013-12-31 19:30:26	dleedev	A1 composited with A3 will result in A3?
2013-12-31 19:30:33	Cale	no
2013-12-31 19:30:44	dleedev	A1 composited with A3 will result in yet another A4?
2013-12-31 19:30:46	Cale	Also, "composed"
2013-12-31 19:31:00	Cale	It can result in pretty much anything
2013-12-31 19:31:14	Cale	So long as the composition is associative and there's an identity arrow
2013-12-31 19:31:18	dleedev	so there could be an infinite number of arrows, right?
2013-12-31 19:31:20	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 19:31:46	Cale	One particular case of this construction would have the arrows correspond to strings
2013-12-31 19:31:50	dleedev	and the monoid category will indeed have an infinite number of arrows, right?
2013-12-31 19:31:53	Cale	and composition would be string concatenation
2013-12-31 19:32:00	Cale	Not always
2013-12-31 19:32:05	Cale	There are finite monoids too
2013-12-31 19:32:15	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 19:32:20	Cale	The smallest monoid has only one element, which is the identity for its operation
2013-12-31 19:32:34	Cale	But also things like addition modulo n
2013-12-31 19:32:40	Cale	or multiplication modulo n
2013-12-31 19:32:45	ocharles	Or boolean conjunction
2013-12-31 19:32:57	dleedev	got it
2013-12-31 19:34:02	dleedev	how quickly do you think we can jump into monads from my current understanding of category theory?
2013-12-31 19:34:03	Cale	So these two classes of examples are sort of the somewhat orthogonal axes that categories generalise along
2013-12-31 19:34:18	Cale	Well, I need to introduce functors and then natural transformations
2013-12-31 19:34:36	Cale	and then we can do monads in their full glory outside of Haskell :)
2013-12-31 19:34:51	dleedev	am I ready for functors?
2013-12-31 19:35:02	Cale	(If you were only interested in monads *in* Haskell, then this is the most roundabout way in the world to go about it)
2013-12-31 19:35:04	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 19:35:06	Cale	Mostly
2013-12-31 19:35:07	zett_zelett	dleedev: I think it’s good to watch some of the catsters vids.
2013-12-31 19:35:20	dleedev	zett_zelett: are those for noobs like me?
2013-12-31 19:35:21	zett_zelett	To see the whole thing in diagrammatic action.
2013-12-31 19:35:34	Cale	dleedev: Some are, unfortunately, they're not very well-ordered
2013-12-31 19:36:08	zett_zelett	The one on monads is preety good in my opnion.
2013-12-31 19:36:11	Cale	But once you know what functors and natural transformations are (at least somewhat), you can start watching those
2013-12-31 19:36:18	dleedev	ok, let's dive into functors
2013-12-31 19:36:22	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 19:36:32	FireFly	Th catster videos are pretty great
2013-12-31 19:36:39	zett_zelett	Anyway, it’s good to see people frantically drawing diagrams on the blackboard.
2013-12-31 19:36:42	Cale	So, functors are the structure-preserving mappings between categories (this is a characterisation, not the definition yet)
2013-12-31 19:36:50	Cale	So, a functor consists of two parts:
2013-12-31 19:36:59	zett_zelett	This somehow really helped me getting a sense of what some stuff is about.
2013-12-31 19:37:01	Cale	Oh, sorry, I should give the setup
2013-12-31 19:37:11	Cale	Let C and D be categories
2013-12-31 19:37:25	Cale	A functor F: C -> D consists of two things:
2013-12-31 19:37:42	Cale	1) A mapping on objects, associating to each object X in C, some object FX in D.
2013-12-31 19:38:05	Cale	2) A mapping on arrows, associating to each arrow a: X -> Y in C, some arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D.
2013-12-31 19:38:27	Cale	and this is subject to the conditions:
2013-12-31 19:38:42	Cale	i) F preserves identities: F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2013-12-31 19:38:58	Cale	ii) F preserves compositions: F(a . b) = (Fa) . (Fb)
2013-12-31 19:39:27	dleedev	can D contain more than the mappings from 1 & 2?
2013-12-31 19:39:36	Cale	D is any category at all
2013-12-31 19:39:42	Cale	as is C
2013-12-31 19:39:49	notdan	dleedev: yes
2013-12-31 19:39:55	Cale	and yeah
2013-12-31 19:40:06	Cale	The mapping on objects doesn't need to cover all of D
2013-12-31 19:40:27	notdan	Just like, say, group homomorphisms need not to be surjective in general; same holds for functors
2013-12-31 19:40:42	Cale	(I don't think dleedev knows what group homomorphisms are)
2013-12-31 19:41:03	Cale	Though he might!
2013-12-31 19:41:41	dleedev	I don't know what "homomorphism" or "surjective" is
2013-12-31 19:41:47	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 19:42:10	notdan	oops, sorry. well it doesn't matter really
2013-12-31 19:42:32	Cale	If f: A -> B is just an ordinary function, we call f surjective when for any b in B, there is some a in A so that f(a) = b
2013-12-31 19:43:14	Cale	and we call f injective if whenever f(x) = f(y), then x = y
2013-12-31 19:43:33	Cale	Or equivalently, if whenever x is not equal to y, then f(x) is not equal to f(y)
2013-12-31 19:43:49	dleedev	btw, what field is all this? mathematics?
2013-12-31 19:44:09	Cale	I guess the definitions of injective and surjective fall under basic set theory
2013-12-31 19:44:19	Cale	They're used throughout mathematics though
2013-12-31 19:45:21	Cale	injective is also commonly called "one-to-one"
2013-12-31 19:45:29	Cale	and surjective is also called "onto"
2013-12-31 19:46:25	dleedev	for any f: A -> B, isn't there a way to define B so that f is surjective?
2013-12-31 19:46:35	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 19:47:05	Cale	(But that's kind of not the same function anymore, even if it has the same graph)
2013-12-31 19:47:09	-->	zett_zelett1 (~zett_zele@p5DE79B2E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-31 19:48:32	dleedev	Cale: well, let's continue
2013-12-31 19:48:34	Cale	okay
2013-12-31 19:49:22	Cale	So, the real numbers under addition form a monoid, and the positive real numbers under multiplication form another monoid
2013-12-31 19:49:41	Cale	We can treat both of these monoids as categories with one object
2013-12-31 19:49:55	Cale	and we can form a functor from one to the other
2013-12-31 19:50:26	Cale	Obviously there's no choice about where the single object is sent
2013-12-31 19:50:33	<--	zett_zelett (~zett_zele@p5DE7879C.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2013-12-31 19:50:41	Cale	But the arrows, we have lots of choices...
2013-12-31 19:51:16	Cale	But based on this description, we want the mapping on arrows to be a function F such that F(a + b) = F(a) * F(b)
2013-12-31 19:51:34	Cale	F going from the real numbers to the positive real numbers
2013-12-31 19:51:40	Cale	Can you think of a function like that?
2013-12-31 19:52:20	Cale	(also, if it helps, we know that F(0) = 1, since those are the respective identity elements for addition and multiplication)
2013-12-31 19:54:54	dleedev	are the + and * the arithmetic signs?
2013-12-31 19:54:58	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 19:55:05	dleedev	F(a plus b) = F(a) times F(b)
2013-12-31 19:55:08	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 19:55:18	dleedev	exponents?
2013-12-31 19:55:25	Cale	yep!
2013-12-31 19:55:38	Cale	e^(a + b) = e^a * e^b for instance
2013-12-31 19:55:50	Cale	Or you can pick any base you like
2013-12-31 19:57:36	Cale	We could also choose two preorder categories and look at what functors between those are
2013-12-31 19:58:03	dleedev	can you explain how exponents are functors?
2013-12-31 19:58:05	Cale	The laws about preserving composition will turn out to be uninteresting (because if the arrow exists at all, there's only one of it)
2013-12-31 19:58:13	Cale	Oh, well...
2013-12-31 19:58:53	Cale	We take the mapping on objects to send the one object of our first monoid-category to the one object of our second (no choice in that)
2013-12-31 19:59:19	Cale	and for the mapping on arrows, we need to send each arrow a: X -> X to an arrow Fa: FX -> FX
2013-12-31 19:59:39	dleedev	and that object is just the type Integer, right?
2013-12-31 19:59:50	Cale	X is nothing important
2013-12-31 20:00:01	Cale	It's just the one object that's there to hold up the fort
2013-12-31 20:00:07	Cale	and let us stick in a bunch of arrows
2013-12-31 20:00:10	dleedev	it doesn't have to be an Integer?
2013-12-31 20:00:13	Cale	nope
2013-12-31 20:00:19	dleedev	wow
2013-12-31 20:00:20	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 20:00:42	Cale	The arrows in our first monoid are the real numbers
2013-12-31 20:00:47	Cale	(all of them)
2013-12-31 20:00:59	Cale	i.e. a: X -> X is an arbitrary real number
2013-12-31 20:01:21	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 20:01:24	Cale	and the arrows in our second category are positive real numbers
2013-12-31 20:01:37	Cale	The composition in our first category is addition
2013-12-31 20:01:44	Cale	(of real numbers)
2013-12-31 20:01:50	zett_zelett1	(You can also think of an arrow X → X as being the *addition* with the real number, if that helps – might be better to see what the composition is, then.)
2013-12-31 20:01:52	Cale	and in our second category, it's multiplication
2013-12-31 20:02:04	Cale	zett_zelett1: I'd rather he didn't
2013-12-31 20:02:09	zett_zelett1	Okay.
2013-12-31 20:02:34	Cale	Examples like this are partly to force you to realise that the arrows don't have to be functions
2013-12-31 20:02:47	Cale	You can always pull tricks to make them look like functions somehow
2013-12-31 20:02:51	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 20:02:56	Cale	But you don't have to :)
2013-12-31 20:03:13	zett_zelett1	Well, I’m off. Else the temptation to meddle in is too big.
2013-12-31 20:03:27	zett_zelett1	Anyways, cya.
2013-12-31 20:03:31	dleedev	zett_zelett1: see ya
2013-12-31 20:03:47	<--	zett_zelett1 (~zett_zele@p5DE79B2E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has left ##categorytheory
2013-12-31 20:04:33	Cale	In the case of this second category, remember that multiplying two positive real numbers gives another positive real number, and that's associative and has the identity element 1 so, our composition is okay
2013-12-31 20:04:57	Cale	and of course, in the case of addition of reals, it's also associative, and has the identity element 0
2013-12-31 20:05:18	Cale	So, remember the rule about functors is that
2013-12-31 20:05:41	Cale	for every composable pair of arrows a and b, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2013-12-31 20:06:03	Cale	where the composition on the left is the one in the first category, and the composition on the right is the composition in the second category
2013-12-31 20:06:17	Cale	So that means in our case, F(a + b) = Fa * Fb
2013-12-31 20:07:04	Cale	and also, for every object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX), well, there's only one object in either category, but this lets us say that F0 = 1
2013-12-31 20:07:25	Cale	the identity arrow in our first category being 0, since the composition is addition
2013-12-31 20:07:37	Cale	and the identity arrow in the second being 1 since the composition is multiplication
2013-12-31 20:07:45	Cale	good?
2013-12-31 20:08:04	Cale	So, there are many functors here, but they're all some sort of exponentiation
2013-12-31 20:08:21	Cale	(at least, they are if we choose the function to be continuous ;)
2013-12-31 20:08:24	dleedev	got it
2013-12-31 20:09:07	Cale	We could also look at endofunctors from the category of real numbers under addition to itself
2013-12-31 20:09:20	Cale	Those are functions such that F(a+b) = Fa + Fb, and F0 = 0
2013-12-31 20:09:46	Cale	So, multiplication by some constant would fit the bill
2013-12-31 20:10:19	Cale	How about the order categories?
2013-12-31 20:10:28	Cale	What might a functor between two order categories be?
2013-12-31 20:10:45	Cale	(Or, what properties would it have?)
2013-12-31 20:11:12	dleedev	what are order categories?
2013-12-31 20:11:16	dleedev	preorder?
2013-12-31 20:11:20	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 20:11:27	Cale	preorder categories
2013-12-31 20:11:54	Cale	If C and D are both preorder categories
2013-12-31 20:12:21	Cale	Then a functor F: C -> D assigns to each object X of C some object FX of D
2013-12-31 20:12:35	Cale	and to each arrow a: X -> Y in C, some arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2013-12-31 20:12:52	Cale	Well, there's at most one arrow X -> Y or FX -> FY
2013-12-31 20:13:02	dleedev	wait...
2013-12-31 20:13:03	Cale	(in this case of a preorder category)
2013-12-31 20:13:28	dleedev	in the previous monoid example, the functor was the Fa (arrow conversion)
2013-12-31 20:13:44	dleedev	now you're saying the functor is the F (object conversion)?
2013-12-31 20:13:51	Cale	A functor has two parts, a mapping on objects, and a mapping on arrows
2013-12-31 20:14:16	Cale	The object part was boring in the monoid case, because both categories only had one object
2013-12-31 20:14:32	Cale	so it had to send that one object to that one other object
2013-12-31 20:14:34	dleedev	can you give what the two parts are in haskell?
2013-12-31 20:15:22	Cale	In Haskell, instances of the Functor type class are functors Hask -> Hask (from the category of Haskell types to itself). The mapping on objects is given by the type level function which is the instance
2013-12-31 20:15:29	Cale	The mapping on arrows is given by fmap
2013-12-31 20:15:36	Cale	fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)

2013-12-31 20:16:28	dleedev	what do you mean by "The mapping on objects is given by the type level function which is the instance"
2013-12-31 20:16:39	Cale	I mean like in the case of
2013-12-31 20:16:57	Cale	data Tree a = Tip | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
2013-12-31 20:17:02	Cale	instance Functor Tree where
2013-12-31 20:17:09	Cale	  fmap f Tip = Tip
2013-12-31 20:17:22	Cale	  fmap f (Branch x l r) = Branch (f x) (fmap f l) (fmap f r)
2013-12-31 20:17:29	Cale	Tree is the mapping on objects
2013-12-31 20:17:41	Cale	it sends types (like Integer) to types (like Tree Integer)
2013-12-31 20:17:51	Cale	and fmap is the mapping on arrows
2013-12-31 20:18:08	Cale	It sends a function f :: X -> Y to a function  fmap f :: Tree X -> Tree Y
2013-12-31 20:18:57	dleedev	ah, got it
2013-12-31 20:19:20	Cale	What's more, we have that fmap id = id
2013-12-31 20:19:26	Cale	and fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g
2013-12-31 20:19:37	Cale	(you could actually check those laws by induction)
2013-12-31 20:19:42	dleedev	but the type signature of id is different on both sides?
2013-12-31 20:19:45	Cale	yes
2013-12-31 20:19:58	Cale	In our category theoretical notation, we were more explicit about the types
2013-12-31 20:20:07	Cale	F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2013-12-31 20:20:37	Cale	But Haskell lets us be a bit fast and loose notationally, since we'll infer the types :)
2013-12-31 20:21:29	Cale	(We can also leave off the subscripts in our category theoretical notation if we like sometimes of course)
2013-12-31 20:21:31	dleedev	if signature of fmap f was Tree X -> Tree X, would that make it a monoid?
2013-12-31 20:22:34	Cale	The set of all functions Tree X -> Tree X forms a monoid under composition
2013-12-31 20:22:51	Cale	Or in general, the set of all arrows from an object to itself in any category form a monoid under composition
2013-12-31 20:23:21	dleedev	what do you mean by "under composition"?
2013-12-31 20:23:36	Cale	I mean that the composition of the arrows is the monoid operation
2013-12-31 20:24:04	Cale	(remember, to define a monoid we need both a set of elements, and an operation on those elements)
2013-12-31 20:24:05	dleedev	I see . = function composition
2013-12-31 20:24:14	dleedev	... arrow composition
2013-12-31 20:24:30	Cale	Function composition being an important special case :)
2013-12-31 20:24:55	dleedev	alright, so what's left?
2013-12-31 20:25:13	Cale	(Well, I should sleep soon, it's 7:30 am)
2013-12-31 20:25:33	dleedev	Cale: of course!
2013-12-31 20:25:41	Cale	Well, we didn't fully explore what functors between preorder categories were
2013-12-31 20:25:43	dleedev	Cale: hey, thanks so much for everything so far
2013-12-31 20:25:48	Cale	No problem!
2013-12-31 20:26:00	Cale	Check out Awodey's book, it goes over lots of this stuff
2013-12-31 20:26:23	dleedev	OK
2013-12-31 20:26:32	dleedev	what's a functor between preorder categories?
2013-12-31 20:26:36	Cale	Okay
2013-12-31 20:27:06	Cale	So, for each arrow a: X -> Y in our first preorder category, we're assigning an arrow Fa: FX -> FY
2013-12-31 20:27:20	Cale	In a preorder category, the arrow X -> Y is telling us that X <= Y
2013-12-31 20:27:38	Cale	and the arrow Fa: FX -> FY then tells us that FX <= FY
2013-12-31 20:27:59	Cale	So, whatever the mapping on objects is doing, whenever X <= Y, we'd better have FX <= FY
2013-12-31 20:28:14	Cale	i.e. the mapping on objects must be an order preserving function
2013-12-31 20:28:21	dleedev	or FX . FY, right?
2013-12-31 20:28:27	Cale	uh
2013-12-31 20:28:35	Cale	FX and FY are objects here
2013-12-31 20:28:39	Cale	we can't compose them
2013-12-31 20:28:57	dleedev	haha, ok
2013-12-31 20:29:00	Cale	Now, we could look at the rules about composition and identities
2013-12-31 20:29:09	Cale	But it turns out they tell us nothing
2013-12-31 20:29:33	dleedev	why not?
2013-12-31 20:29:45	dleedev	they give us the structure mapping, right?
2013-12-31 20:29:47	Cale	In the case of F(id_X) = id_(FX) well, there was only one arrow FX -> FX to choose anyway
2013-12-31 20:30:04	Cale	and in the case of F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2013-12-31 20:30:17	Cale	again, there's only one arrow to choose
2013-12-31 20:30:31	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 20:30:35	-->	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has joined ##categorytheory
2013-12-31 20:30:45	Cale	F(a . b) and Fa . Fb will be arrows between the same pair of objects
2013-12-31 20:31:06	Cale	and since there's at most one between any given pair, they already have to be equal in this case
2013-12-31 20:32:04	dleedev	ok
2013-12-31 20:32:49	Cale	In general, monoid categories will let us examine what the definitions mean when the arrows are interesting and examine equations and stuff without worrying so much about the objects, and preorder categories will let us examine what goes on with the objects and arrows when all the equations work out trivially.
2013-12-31 20:33:35	Cale	For general categories, both of these things will be interesting and important, but it's nice to have some examples where you don't have everything going all at once
2013-12-31 20:34:14	dleedev	so monoid categories and preorder categories are examples of extremes?
2013-12-31 20:34:18	Cale	yeah
2013-12-31 20:34:30	Cale	They're sort of two extreme cases of categories
2013-12-31 20:34:49	dleedev	so what would be a functor between preorder categories?
2013-12-31 20:34:57	dleedev	(-)?
2013-12-31 20:35:26	Cale	In a general category, you're going to have potentially lots of arrows between every pair of objects (like the monoid case), but you're *also* going to have lots of objects, and they may or may not have any arrows at all between them (like the preorder case)
2013-12-31 20:36:27	Cale	Well, if we take the case of the real numbers with their usual ordering
2013-12-31 20:36:40	Cale	Fx = x^3 is order preserving :)
2013-12-31 20:36:53	Cale	Whenever x <= y, we have x^3 <= y^3
2013-12-31 20:37:11	Cale	Or in the case of the olympics
2013-12-31 20:37:16	dleedev	and Fa would be id?
2013-12-31 20:37:53	Cale	A lot of the various scoring systems people use are functors from that weak ordering (which doesn't strictly order every pair of countries) to some sort of numbers
2013-12-31 20:38:38	Cale	i.e. any good scoring system should preserve the relationships there, but might assign different values to the medals
2013-12-31 20:38:53	dleedev	Cale: I see
2013-12-31 20:39:35	dleedev	for real numbers, F x = x ^ 3, F arrow = arrow?
2013-12-31 20:39:50	Cale	(and of course, countries always like to choose the scoring system which places them the highest ;)
2013-12-31 20:40:30	Cale	Well, "F arrow = arrow" is about right ;)
2013-12-31 20:40:39	dleedev	or F = id?
2013-12-31 20:40:41	Cale	but x and x^3 are *objects* there
2013-12-31 20:40:52	Cale	(this is a preorder category we're talking about)
2013-12-31 20:41:08	Cale	So the objects are real numbers, and the arrows tell us when x <= y
2013-12-31 20:41:22	Cale	(the presence of an arrow x -> y says that x <= y)
2013-12-31 20:41:53	Cale	Our functor has two parts, a mapping on objects and a mapping on arrows
2013-12-31 20:42:03	Cale	I'm saying, send the object x to the object x^3
2013-12-31 20:42:19	Cale	(every real number can be cubed so that's good)
2013-12-31 20:42:39	Cale	and we need to check that whenever there's an arrow a: x -> y
2013-12-31 20:42:53	Cale	that there's also an arrow to serve as Fa: Fx -> Fy
2013-12-31 20:43:07	Cale	i.e. whenever x <= y as real numbers
2013-12-31 20:43:15	Cale	then we'd better have x^3 <= y^3
2013-12-31 20:43:23	Cale	and indeed, that's the case
2013-12-31 20:43:36	dleedev	so arrow = (<=)
2013-12-31 20:43:51	Cale	yeah, arrows in a preorder category correspond to <= relationships
2013-12-31 20:44:11	Cale	(there's exactly one arrow X -> Y whenever X <= Y)
2013-12-31 20:44:17	Cale	(and none otherwise)
2013-12-31 20:44:39	Cale	okay, I'd better sleep!
2013-12-31 20:44:42	Cale	g'night!
2013-12-31 20:44:46	dleedev	Cale: ok, good night!

2014-01-01 13:17:22	drbean	I didn't notice that. The functor might put KOR and JPN ahead of ITA and FRA.
2014-01-01 13:19:07	drbean	Wait. The functor won't do that, because there are no arrows between those countries, unless it maps different countries to each other.
2014-01-01 13:20:28	Cale	drbean: It might give some countries the same score
2014-01-01 13:20:35	Cale	drbean: Or it might order them in either direction
2014-01-01 13:21:43	Cale	drbean: Whatever the functor does, we know that since ITA <= KOR, we'll have that hold of their scores by the functor
2014-01-01 13:22:22	Cale	but since there's no arrow in either direction between KOR and FRA, a scoring system can opt to order them either way, or make them equivalent
2014-01-01 13:23:17	drbean	If there's no arrow between KOR and FRA now, how is the functor going to map an arrow joining them?
2014-01-01 13:23:39	Cale	For example, consider f (g,s,b) = g + s + b
2014-01-01 13:23:52	Cale	and f' (g,s,b) = 10*g + 5*s + b
2014-01-01 13:24:19	Cale	those functions give two different functors, they both preserve the partial order
2014-01-01 13:24:43	Cale	But f (13,10,8) = 31, and f' (13,10,8) = 188
2014-01-01 13:24:44	Cale	while
2014-01-01 13:25:02	Cale	f (7,16,17) = 40, and f' (7,16,17) = 167
2014-01-01 13:25:32	Cale	So Korea and France get ordered in the opposite way by those two different choices
2014-01-01 13:26:36	Cale	f here rates countries just counting all the medals as being of the same weight
2014-01-01 13:26:49	drbean	Those will be 2 categories in which there is a total order.
2014-01-01 13:26:58	Cale	f' rates gold medals as being twice as good as silver, and silver as five times better than bronze
2014-01-01 13:27:40	Cale	Well, they're both determining functors from this poset category to the poset category of natural numbers with their usual ordering
2014-01-01 13:27:50	drbean	OK.
2014-01-01 13:28:00	Cale	(by saying where the objects go)
2014-01-01 13:29:03	Cale	To check that they really give functors, we'd have to show that whenever (g,s,b) <= (G,S,B) in the sense given on that website, that g <= G and g + s <= G + S and g + s + b <= G + S + B, then f (g,s,b) <= f (G,S,B)
2014-01-01 13:29:11	Cale	Well, that one is obvious
2014-01-01 13:29:19	Cale	A little less obvious that f' works too
2014-01-01 13:30:56	Cale	But f'(g,s,b) = (g + s + b) + 4 * (g + s) + 5 * g
2014-01-01 13:31:30	Cale	and so if we have those three inequalities, that g <= G and g + s <= G + S and g + s + b <= G + S + B
2014-01-01 13:32:01	Cale	then f'(g,s,b) = (g + s + b) + 4 * (g + s) + 5 * g <= (G + S + B) + 4 * (G + S) + 5 * G = f'(G,S,B)
2014-01-01 13:32:26	Cale	and so f' really does give a functor here
2014-01-01 13:52:32	Cale	If we want to be really cruel to Sweden, we can define h(g,s,b) = g * (g+s) * (g+s+b)
2014-01-01 13:52:52	Cale	and sorry Sweden, you got 4 silver and 1 bronze medal, but your score is 0 now :)
2014-01-01 13:54:25	drbean	I'm just worried in the case of a functor from the category at http://tartarus.org/simon/2008-olympics-hasse/ given by either f or f', that it won't be surjective.
2014-01-01 13:54:37	Cale	It need not be surjective
2014-01-01 13:54:45	Cale	and it need not be injective

2014-01-01 14:17:24	drbean	An example of a non-injective mapping of objects might be to group ex-USSR nations together, or have a ranking of continents.
2014-01-01 14:30:19	Cale	yes
2014-01-01 14:30:58	Cale	Or of course there's always the constant functor, which sends all the countries to the same object, and all the arrows to the identity arrow on that object
2014-01-01 14:31:30	Cale	(I suppose I should say "constant functors", because there's one for each object in the codomain category)

2014-01-01 15:18:24	Cale	(and it's aimed at a room full of CS people)
2014-01-01 15:18:43	dleedev	Cale: is this in lieu of the paper by awodey?
2014-01-01 15:19:05	Cale	Nah, it's more alongside it, the book I gave is one which he provided to those students
2014-01-01 15:20:09	Cale	(The PDF is a whole book, this is just a few lectures which give a broad overview of a bunch of stuff, and while they cover a lot, they skim over any fiddly details.)

2014-01-01 15:24:26	dleedev	I'm not a mathematician, so my concept of algebra is "solving for variables"
2014-01-01 15:25:08	Cale	dleedev: Well, he makes it clearer what he means by that, but the idea is that we're abstracting over the details
2014-01-01 15:25:23	Cale	So, as a programmer, you might think of it as an abstract interface
2014-01-01 15:25:57	Cale	We're going to take some aspects of functions and generalise over them, and look at other stuff that kind of behaves similarly
2014-01-01 15:27:26	dleedev	So does "algebra of X" mean abstract generalization over X?
2014-01-01 15:27:30	Cale	yeah
2014-01-01 15:27:41	Cale	Well, in an informal way
2014-01-01 15:28:06	dleedev	so it means figuring out the general rules of a system?
2014-01-01 15:28:12	Cale	yeah
2014-01-01 15:28:23	Cale	That's the way Awodey means it there anyway
2014-01-01 15:28:47	dleedev	but what about generally (not just awodey)?
2014-01-01 15:29:09	dleedev	I've heard it often outside of this lecture, and I'm curious what it really means
2014-01-01 15:29:14	Cale	There are various technical uses of the term "algebra" to mean various things, and some of them are closely related to this sense of defining some basic components and rules and then looking at structures that satisfy those

2014-01-01 15:30:27	Cale	In general, it means a way of calculating something
2014-01-01 15:31:39	dleedev	awodey mentions how "algebra of functions" and "lambda calculus" are related but different
2014-01-01 15:32:30	dleedev	what does he mean?
2014-01-01 15:34:47	Cale	The lecture series will explore that
2014-01-01 15:34:53	Cale	He's going to talk about the lambda calculus :)
2014-01-01 15:35:22	Cale	Or do you mean in the book somewhere?
2014-01-01 15:35:29	dleedev	the lecture
2014-01-01 15:35:33	Cale	okay, then yeah
2014-01-01 15:35:36	dleedev	I guess I'll encounter it once he gets to it
2014-01-01 15:36:20	Cale	yeah, when he's talking about categories as a sort of abstract algebra of functions, he's just introducing the notion of category by way of the very nice example of the category of sets and functions
2014-01-01 15:37:56	dleedev	I don't understand what you mean
2014-01-01 15:38:23	dleedev	you mean the category of sets and functions is an example of categories?
2014-01-01 15:38:36	Cale	Yeah, an example of a category
2014-01-01 15:38:53	Cale	He's taking it as a sort of first example that we're going to generalise away from
2014-01-01 15:39:02	dleedev	I see
2014-01-01 15:39:08	dleedev	btw, what's your background?
2014-01-01 15:39:45	Cale	I have a BMath in pure mathematics from the University of Waterloo, and I've been programming in Haskell since around 2001 or so.
2014-01-01 15:40:11	Cale	(and in other languages for a good bit longer :)
2014-01-01 15:40:47	dleedev	it seems like Haskell is a popular language for math folks
2014-01-01 15:41:28	Cale	The way that you tend to think while programming in Haskell has some similar structure to it to the way that you tend to think while proving theorems
2014-01-01 15:41:59	Cale	(I would say that this applies to programming in general, but it's *especially* true in the case of Haskell and other pure functional programming languages
2014-01-01 15:42:01	Cale	)
2014-01-01 15:42:10	Cale	Haskell supports algebraic reasoning
2014-01-01 15:42:28	Cale	If I know that f x = g x for all x, then I can replace occurrences of f with g in my program
2014-01-01 15:42:39	Cale	and I know that I haven't screwed things up
2014-01-01 15:43:09	dleedev	I feel like everyone programming on Haskell has a strong math background
2014-01-01 15:43:32	Cale	Well, not everyone, but it tends to encourage many people to strengthen their math backgrounds
2014-01-01 15:43:33	dleedev	and that I'm at a big disadvantage
2014-01-01 15:44:03	Cale	You definitely do not need to start out with any mathematics background, or learn any category theory whatsoever, to learn to be a practical Haskell programmer.
2014-01-01 15:44:03	dleedev	even when people teach haskell, they teach from a math perspective
2014-01-01 15:44:34	Cale	But you *will* find that many little scraps of mathematics you pick up will immediately be useful.
2014-01-01 15:45:10	Cale	There are people like Edward Kmett, who has just singlehandedly been translating large swathes of category theory into Haskell libraries.
2014-01-01 15:45:26	Cale	and then finding really clever ways to put those things to use right away :)
2014-01-01 15:45:55	dleedev	what's a good example of something he put to use right away?
2014-01-01 15:46:48	Cale	So, there's this thing called a codensity monad
2014-01-01 15:48:01	Cale	ackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-3.7/docs/Control-Monad-Codensity.html
2014-01-01 15:48:03	Cale	oops
2014-01-01 15:48:07	Cale	http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-3.7/docs/Control-Monad-Codensity.html
2014-01-01 15:49:14	Cale	This is a sort of specialisation of a much more general thing from category theory, but surprisingly, it has this interesting property that you can take computations written for other monads, and make them use this thing instead, and sometimes it speeds them up.
2014-01-01 15:50:23	Cale	(You can do this trickery in other ways, but it's rather interesting that you can pull this abstract nonsense (I mean that in the nicest possible way) off the shelf, and magically it's beneficial.
2014-01-01 15:50:39	Cale	or this library http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors
2014-01-01 15:50:52	Cale	actually, this one even moreso: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/profunctors
2014-01-01 15:51:06	Cale	profunctors get used all over lens
2014-01-01 15:51:23	Cale	lens is a library which is used to define "functional references"
2014-01-01 15:51:30	Cale	So like, if you have some big datastructure
2014-01-01 15:51:39	Cale	in Java, say, you might define getters and setters
2014-01-01 15:51:54	dleedev	analogous to views in SQL?
2014-01-01 15:52:08	Cale	lens is like the immutable datastructure analogue of that
2014-01-01 15:52:10	dleedev	or more like getters/setters?
2014-01-01 15:52:43	Cale	It gives you lots of tools for defining these things which represent a small part of a larger datastructure, and defines operations for extracting it, or replacing it with another value, or applying functions to it
2014-01-01 15:53:45	shachaf	But the reasons lens uses profunctors have very little to do with lenses.
2014-01-01 15:54:00	Cale	Well, yeah, it's for additional machinery :)
2014-01-01 15:55:48	Cale	(Mostly the stuff surrounding prisms, which are like lenses, but instead of picking out some field of a larger datastructure, they let you pick out some case of a bunch of possible options.)
2014-01-01 15:56:17	dleedev	would people who don't have a math background be able to understand and use these advanced (?) libraries?
2014-01-01 15:56:25	Cale	yeah
2014-01-01 15:56:32	Cale	There's a lot of abstraction there
2014-01-01 15:56:57	Cale	but you can understand it all in mundane terms
2014-01-01 15:56:59	shachaf	I didn't even know about profunctors when I invented profunctor lenses!
2014-01-01 15:57:28	shachaf	Fortunately edwardk knew about the abstraction I was trying to get at.
2014-01-01 15:57:45	dleedev	does the category theory book go over profunctors, codensity monads, etc?
2014-01-01 15:57:52	Cale	No, that's all fancy stuff
2014-01-01 15:58:03	Cale	(but if you read the book, you can certainly pick it up)
2014-01-01 15:58:25	Cale	You could of course, pick it up in the context of Haskell without even understanding how it generalises to other categories
2014-01-01 15:58:34	Cale	But it's nice to see that too sometimes
2014-01-01 15:59:11	Cale	The bigger picture is that mathematicians have often already tackled similar sorts of problems in terms of structuring things that we face in designing libraries that are reusable
2014-01-01 16:00:14	Cale	and because category theory is general enough, we can specialise the things down to the context of programming in Haskell and end up with things we can often start finding uses for right away
2014-01-01 16:03:16	Cale	dleedev: Or of course, there's the idea of monads in the first place
2014-01-01 16:03:27	dleedev	Cale: that's true

2014-01-04 03:21:09	Saizan	anyone else likes "Nat(Hom,F) ~ end c. F(c,c) forall F, natural in F" as a yoneda lemma thing?
2014-01-04 03:22:56	mr-	I don't understand the statement
2014-01-04 03:35:04	Saizan	the usual lemma is Nat(Hom(-,c),F) ~ F(c) forall c and F
2014-01-04 03:35:36	Saizan	Nat(F,G) being the set of natural transformations between F and G
2014-01-04 03:35:59	Saizan	and Hom(-,c) being the yoneda embedding applied to c
2014-01-04 03:36:13	Saizan	my version makes it more symmetrical
2014-01-04 03:36:45	Saizan	though in mine F : C^op x C -> Set rather than C^op -> Set
2014-01-04 03:37:28	Saizan	like Hom as a bigunctor vs Hom partially applied
2014-01-04 03:37:34	Saizan	*bifunctor
2014-01-04 03:39:20	Saizan	end c. F(c,c) is basically saying that F is reflexive, if you think of it as a relation
2014-01-04 03:43:18	mr-	I know the usual Yoneda lemma, but what is end c. F(c,c) ?
2014-01-04 03:46:37	Saizan	the end of F, http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/end , it's an object in the target category of F with a way to project out F(c,c) for all c
2014-01-04 03:51:37	mr-	Ah, now I can parse it. :-)

2014-01-04 06:26:04	tac	I was talking about ends and coends. But apparently they aren't even a real topic. I heard so from a real life algebraic topologist, even!
2014-01-04 06:26:51	engimo	would you say that direct sums are a topic? you're not gonna find a book by someone called "Introduction to Coends and Ends", it's just a thing that shows up when you're studying basic categorical concepts
2014-01-04 06:27:05	tac	I didn't ask for a book on the subject, did I?
2014-01-04 06:27:26	engimo	that's not my point
2014-01-04 06:27:47	tac	They aren't mentioned in Awodey, at least. Which is a counter example to your claim "any text would include a discussion".
2014-01-04 06:28:34	tac	Nor are they in the half dozen freely available category theory books I've looked through.
2014-01-04 06:29:18	engimo	sorry, i should have added the caveat "any good text"
2014-01-04 06:29:37	engimo	they're just particular types of (co)limits, theres not much going on
2014-01-04 06:29:45	engimo	which is why i said it's not really a topic
2014-01-04 06:30:16	tac	Well, I'm glad you've split that hair :)
2014-01-04 06:33:56	tomprince	 monads are just monoid objects in the endofunctor category. They aren't really a topic.
2014-01-04 06:34:49	tac	a topic is just an endofunctor on the category of engimos.
2014-01-04 06:34:50	tomprince	And yet, there are hundreds of tutorials on them ...
2014-01-04 06:35:36	tac	I wouldn't doubt that there are.
2014-01-04 06:35:46	tomprince	http://blog.sigfpe.com/search?q=coend maybe?
2014-01-04 06:36:49	 *	tac wonders if he's the only one whose eyes glaze over whenever he sees category theory explained with Haskell explains >___>
2014-01-04 06:37:39	tac	So a dinatural transformation is a generalization of Hom to an arbitrary target category
2014-01-04 06:38:48	tac	ahh. I remember seeing that funny double-dotted arrow syntax before and not quite "getting" it. But it's something like embedding a category into another category, isn't it?
2014-01-04 06:42:50	tomprince	http://comonad.com/reader/index.php?s=coend maybe too.

2014-01-08 16:02:58	dleedev	an endofunctor is a functor that maps from one category back to the exact same category, right?

2014-01-08 16:09:38	dleedev	bishboria: so what's the difference between an endofunctor and an identity functor?
2014-01-08 16:17:42	bishboria	Endofunctors don't have to map objects/arrows within the category to themselves, whereas an identity functor does.
2014-01-08 16:20:55	dleedev	bishboria: can you give a very basic example of an endofunctor that isn't an identity functor?

2014-01-08 16:46:05	bishboria	A simple one might be: Set category Int -> Nat
2014-01-08 16:47:14	bishboria	Sorry for the delay, I'm on my way to work :)
2014-01-08 16:50:52	mr-	dleedev: Take the catgory Top and the functor that F: Top -> Top; F(T) = * and F(S -> T) = id_*. It is an endofunctor, but not the identity
2014-01-08 16:52:20	dleedev	mr-: sorry, I don't know what * means
2014-01-08 16:53:54	dleedev	actually, I don't even know what Top is
2014-01-08 16:55:06	dleedev	bishboria: what would F: Int -> Nat be?
2014-01-08 16:56:25	bishboria	An endofunctor that isn't an identity functor
2014-01-08 16:57:27	mr-	dleedev: what categories do you know?
2014-01-08 16:57:46	<--	peterbb (~peterbb@nat-wireless.itu.dk) has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2014-01-08 16:58:56	dleedev	mr-: none, actually
2014-01-08 16:59:23	dleedev	bishboria: I meant, what would the example endofunctor from Int -> Nat look like?
2014-01-08 16:59:42	dleedev	mr-: I guess monoid is a category
2014-01-08 16:59:58	dleedev	mr-: preorder is another
2014-01-08 17:02:12	mr-	dleedev: that's a bit inprecise. There is a category of all monoids, every set with a preorder gives you a category and there is a category of all sets with preorders.
2014-01-08 17:02:53	mr-	dleedev: Do you know the category of sets (Set) ?
2014-01-08 17:03:05	dleedev	mr-: no, but I can learn :)
2014-01-08 17:03:57	mr-	dleedev: an object of Set is a set, given two sets A, B the morphisms from A to B are just functions A -> B
2014-01-08 17:04:14	dleedev	mr-: got it
2014-01-08 17:04:40	dleedev	mr-: what would be an example of an endofunctor Set -> Set that is not an identity functor?
2014-01-08 17:05:25	mr-	dleedev: A functor F: Set -> Set is something that gives you a set F(S) for every set S and for every map f: A -> B it has to give you a map F(f): F(A) -> F(B), right?
2014-01-08 17:06:10	dleedev	mr-: yes
2014-01-08 17:06:19	mr-	dleedev: now consider the functor F(S) = {1} for all S and F(f) = id_{1}. Is it an endofunctor?
2014-01-08 17:07:00	dleedev	mr-: no, because it got rid of a lot of objects and morphisms
2014-01-08 17:07:39	mr-	dleedev: But that's not the definition of "Endofunctor". An Endofunctor really is just a functor Set -> Set in this case.
2014-01-08 17:07:43	dleedev	mr-: the resulting category has 1 object and 1 morphism
2014-01-08 17:08:01	dleedev	the resulting category ≠ Set
2014-01-08 17:08:04	mr-	it does not have to be surjecitve in any sense
2014-01-08 17:10:29	dleedev	are you saying the resulting category = Set?
2014-01-08 17:11:05	dleedev	perhaps I'm misunderstanding what a functor "Set -> Set" means
2014-01-08 17:11:46	<--	whaletechno (~whaletech@unaffiliated/whaletechno) has quit (Quit: ha det bra)
2014-01-08 17:12:32	dleedev	is "Set" the name of the category, or is it the name of the kind of category?
2014-01-08 17:16:07	dleedev	mr-: I've seen the definition of endofuctor as "A functor that maps a category to itself"
2014-01-08 17:19:27	-->	dibblego (~nobody@brisbane-router.veitchlister.com.au) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-01-08 17:19:55	dleedev	mr-: the first category has A and B as objects, whereas the resulting category has {1} as the object
2014-01-08 17:20:15	dleedev	mr-: I don't see how the first category is the same as the resulting category
2014-01-08 17:20:58	bishboria	{1} = set of 1
2014-01-08 17:22:20	dleedev	bishboria: I understand that, but that set's the only object that the resulting category has
2014-01-08 17:22:33	dleedev	bishboria: while the original category had all possible sets as objects
2014-01-08 17:22:47	dleedev	how are the two categories equal?
2014-01-08 17:22:51	bishboria	It's still a set in the category of Sets
2014-01-08 17:23:21	bishboria	it might not be complicated, or do very much, but it's still in the same category
2014-01-08 17:23:48	dleedev	I understand that {1} is in both the first category and the result category
2014-01-08 17:24:09	dleedev	but the first category has other sets as objects, such as {2}, whereas the resulting category does not have {2} as an object
2014-01-08 17:24:30	dleedev	the first category and the resulting category are not equal
2014-01-08 17:24:56	dleedev	the first category = "the category of all sets", the resulting category = "the category of the set {1}"
2014-01-08 17:25:10	dleedev	bishboria: am I misunderstanding something?
2014-01-08 17:25:55	mr-	dleedev: you are misunderstanding something
2014-01-08 17:26:05	mr-	{1} is a set, so it is an object in Set
2014-01-08 17:26:22	dleedev	mr-: I understand that, it's an object in the first category
2014-01-08 17:26:31	mr-	dleedev: in the same way that f(n) = 1 is a function N -> N
2014-01-08 17:26:43	mr-	(where N is the natural numbers)
2014-01-08 17:27:49	mr-	dleedev: does that make sense to you?
2014-01-08 17:28:37	dleedev	mr-: kind of
2014-01-08 17:28:45	dleedev	mr-: so does the resulting category include {2}?
2014-01-08 17:29:56	mr-	dleedev: what do you mean with "resulting category"?
2014-01-08 17:30:08	mr-	dleedev: {2} is not in the _image_ of the functor
2014-01-08 17:30:24	mr-	dleedev: (it is in the essential image, but all that is besides the point)
2014-01-08 17:30:28	dleedev	mr-: given functor F: A -> B, what do you call A and what do you call B?
2014-01-08 17:30:40	dleedev	mr-: what's analogous to "domain" and "codomain" in category?
2014-01-08 17:30:53	mr-	dleedev: probably domain and codomain
2014-01-08 17:31:58	bishboria	dleedev: mr-'s f: N -> N; f n = 1 is a good way to think of a concrete example
2014-01-08 17:32:30	mr-	dleedev: the point it, that the functor F: Set -> Set, F(S) = {1}, F(f) = id_{1} has Domain Set and Codomain Set. (But its Image is {1})
2014-01-08 17:32:34	dleedev	mr-: OK, now I'm beginning to understand
2014-01-08 17:32:53	mr-	s/the point it/the point is/
2014-01-08 17:33:43	dleedev	mr- and bishboria thanks so much
2014-01-08 17:33:54	mr-	dleedev: you have been confusing the image with the codomain
2014-01-08 17:34:37	dleedev	mr-: yes, exactly
2014-01-08 17:36:07	mr-	dleedev: now you can ask a better question, though: Are there endofunctors that are (essentially) surjective that are not the identity? (The answer is still yes)
2014-01-08 17:36:30	dleedev	mr-: I'll ask that when I remember what "surjective" means :)
2014-01-08 17:36:50	dleedev	mr-: My confusion was due to the fact that nowhere in category theory literature does it refer to functor F : A -> B as a mapping between "domain" A and "codomain" B
2014-01-08 17:36:59	dleedev	mr-: they never use the terms domain and codomain
2014-01-08 17:37:35	dleedev	mr-: so when they say "mapping" I'm thinking "value" A -> "value" B
2014-01-08 17:37:55	bishboria	dleedev: Page 5 of Steve Awodey's Category Theory book does :)
2014-01-08 17:38:26	mr-	dleedev: even when people say "mapping" they don't imply that you have to hit every value in the codomain (that's what surjective is)
2014-01-08 17:39:54	dleedev	bishboria: are you referring to Deﬁnition 1.1?
2014-01-08 17:40:05	bishboria	yeah
2014-01-08 17:40:19	dleedev	bishboria: that's not talking about a functor's domain/codomain, that's talking about an arrow's domain/codomain
2014-01-08 17:41:57	dleedev	mr-: but people usually use "mapping" to describe value to value, not domain to codomain
2014-01-08 17:41:58	mr-	dleedev: just think of a functor as a function (that also has to do something reasonable to morphisms)
2014-01-08 17:42:14	mr-	dleedev: not really, at least not in math
2014-01-08 17:42:37	dleedev	mr-: OK, maybe that's why... I don't have a math background
2014-01-08 17:42:41	bishboria	category theory is more abstract than value to value
2014-01-08 17:43:33	dleedev	bishboria: yes, I understand that
2014-01-08 17:43:51	dleedev	I think my overall confusion was due to a misunderstand of "mapping"
2014-01-08 17:44:19	dleedev	most definitions using "mapping" in the mathematic sense of domain to codomain, whereas I was understanding it to mean value to value
2014-01-08 17:45:18	dleedev	btw, you both have helped me clear a major frustration in understanding category theory
2014-01-08 17:45:20	dleedev	many many thanks
2014-01-08 17:45:22	mr-	dleedev: I think it might be good for you to try to find examples for the definitions you are trying to understand.

2014-01-09 10:57:28	dleedev	hi, in awodey's book, it says that "for any set X, the set of functions from X to X is a monoid under the operation of composition"
2014-01-09 10:57:57	dleedev	shouldn't there be an additional condition that the set of functions from X to X include the identity function?
2014-01-09 10:59:08	dleedev	or is the identity function implied to exist for any set X?
2014-01-09 10:59:16	copumpkin	it does, yeah
2014-01-09 11:00:13	dleedev	copumpkin: is that part of the definition of a set?
2014-01-09 11:00:19	engimo	what
2014-01-09 11:00:32	engimo	its not an implication, it just does
2014-01-09 11:00:46	engimo	given a set, there is an identity function, always
2014-01-09 11:01:28	dleedev	engimo: so it's part of the definition of a set
2014-01-09 11:01:34	engimo	no, it's not
2014-01-09 11:01:37	copumpkin	more like the definition of a function
2014-01-09 11:01:41	engimo	what are you talking about
2014-01-09 11:01:54	engimo	you have a set, there is an associated set of functions from that set to itself
2014-01-09 11:02:00	copumpkin	if you consider a function to be a particular type of binary relation
2014-01-09 11:02:01	engimo	there is always an identity function
2014-01-09 11:02:46	copumpkin	it's not "part of the definition", but it follows from basic axioms
2014-01-09 11:02:49	jgross	engimo: What kind of set are you talking about?  A ZFC set?  An ETCS set?  A colloquial set?
2014-01-09 11:02:59	engimo	i dont care
2014-01-09 11:03:34	engimo	if any of the things don't have what i just said, said thing is fucked up
2014-01-09 11:04:02	jgross	copumpkin: You're talking about a ZFC set, right?  For an ETCS set, it's part of the definition of a category (that all objects have an identity morphism), right?
2014-01-09 11:04:53	copumpkin	yeah, or some "traditional" set
2014-01-09 11:05:06	copumpkin	since it is one of the axioms of a category and thus follows more immediately
2014-01-09 11:11:23	tac	engimo: You spend an awfully lot of time concerning yourself about things you don't care about
2014-01-09 11:12:01	engimo	while that might be true, the interpretation of what i just said was "it shouldn't matter"

2014-01-11 04:04:06	NickKidman	Can one say that for any category C, the images of functors C->Set contain all information about C. I.e. are the functors to Set indeed special, and which we still can and want to look at functors from C to other abstract categories D, the real results one is initially motivated in always relate to representations of C in the set language?

2014-01-11 06:04:46	Cale	NickKidman: hmm... well, the Yoneda lemma says that we can take C and embed it via the functor y into the category of functors C^op -> Set, and moreover when we do this, each f: A -> B in C is sent to a unique arrow yf: yA -> yB, and every arrow yA -> yB is the image of some arrow A -> B.
2014-01-11 06:05:46	Cale	NickKidman: The category of functors C^op -> Set has a lot of nice properties: it's complete and cocomplete (i.e. has all small limits and colimits), it has exponentials, it's a topos, and so on.
2014-01-11 06:06:26	Cale	(you can interpret Coq in it :)
2014-01-11 06:06:46	NickKidman	it's a pre-sheaf I guess, or at least almost
2014-01-11 06:06:49	Cale	NickKidman: and so this lets us use a category with all the fancy widgets we could ever want, in order to reason about out possibly deficient category C.
2014-01-11 06:06:50	Cale	our*
2014-01-11 06:07:10	NickKidman	but do you automatically have the Yoneda embedding, don't you need the existence of any functor beforehand?
2014-01-11 06:07:12	Cale	Yeah, that's the definition of a presheaf
2014-01-11 06:07:24	Cale	It's automatic
2014-01-11 06:08:08	NickKidman	but...aren't there categories without faithful functors to Set?
2014-01-11 06:08:09	Cale	It's just: A |--> Hom(-,A)
2014-01-11 06:08:36	NickKidman	and then there must be some information which is hidden if we only consider representations in Set
2014-01-11 06:09:26	Cale	Hom(-,A) being the functor C^op -> Set which sends an object X in C to the set Hom(X,A), and a function f: X -> Y in C (so f: Y -> X in C^op) to the set function Hom(Y,A) -> Hom(X,A) by composition.
2014-01-11 06:09:48	mr-	NickKidman: it's not a faithful functor _to_ set. The functor C -> C^Set is what Cale is talking about
2014-01-11 06:10:07	mr-	err..
2014-01-11 06:10:11	Cale	i.e. if we start with some g: Y -> A, and we have f: X -> Y, then we can compose g . f : X -> A
2014-01-11 06:10:22	mr-	never mind me... too tired
2014-01-11 06:10:29	Cale	and that defines a function between these Hom sets
2014-01-11 06:11:14	Cale	So, yeah, it's not Set that we're embedding C in here, it's a category of functors to Set.
2014-01-11 06:12:25	Cale	As it happens, we can also always get a functor C -> Set, but it won't usually have the embedding properties I mentioned where the functor is a bijection on the arrows between corresponding pairs of objects
2014-01-11 06:12:32	NickKidman	should I think of the Yoneda embedding on objects (A being mapped to homs into A) as the realization of the idea "a set is determined by the maps into it"?
2014-01-11 06:14:32	Cale	and in order to do that, you can always just send each object X in C to the set {f : A in C, f: A -> X} of all arrows whose codomain is X, and then a function f: X -> Y is sent to the function which sends each g: A -> X to some f . g: A -> Y

2014-01-11 06:16:35	NickKidman	I lose track of what you're refering to. What is a different thing? And what does the first half of "{f : A in C, f: A -> X} " mean
2014-01-11 06:16:48	Cale	Oh, maybe I should have written that with a |
2014-01-11 06:16:56	Cale	{f | A in C, f: A -> X}
2014-01-11 06:17:01	Cale	It's a set comprehension
2014-01-11 06:17:15	NickKidman	okay

2014-01-11 06:18:31	Cale	So, above, earlier, I gave a way to construct a functor C -> Set^(C^op), but this latter construction is just a functor C -> Set

2014-01-11 06:19:51	Cale	The sets we're assigning to the objects of C though are in some way imprecise representations of the original objects of C, in that not all set functions between these sets of arrows will actually come from composition with some arrow in C.
2014-01-11 06:20:10	Cale	Only *some* of the set functions will actually be representations of arrows in C like that
2014-01-11 06:20:33	Cale	But when you do the real Yoneda embedding, from C to Set^(C^op), it's better
2014-01-11 06:21:01	Cale	When you look at two functors in the image, the natural transformations between them *exactly* correspond bijectively to arrows in C.
2014-01-11 06:21:31	Cale	It's just that Set^(C^op) has many more objects than C had in general.
2014-01-11 06:22:30	NickKidman	okay, yeah
2014-01-11 06:23:09	NickKidman	the objects of Set^(C^op) are not just, speaking in set theoretic terms, the global elements, but all the generalized elements

2014-01-11 06:23:30	NickKidman	the objects of Set^(C^op) are not just, speaking in set theoretic terms, the sets of global elements, but the sets of all the generalized elements
2014-01-11 06:23:47	<--	CADD_ (~CADD@12.227.104.109) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2014-01-11 06:24:05	Cale	Well, even my other construction of a functor C -> Set was producing the set of all generalised elements for each object in C.
2014-01-11 06:24:57	Cale	The functor C(-,A) : C^op -> Set which is the image of some object A under the Yoneda embedding has more structure though.
2014-01-11 06:25:29	Cale	It's the generalised elements of A arranged into a functor which is parameterised over the object you choose for the domain
2014-01-11 06:26:08	NickKidman	okay yeah. what is the "other construction of a functor C -> Set"
2014-01-11 06:26:09	NickKidman	?
2014-01-11 06:26:43	Cale	Send the object X to the set of all arrows {f: A -> X | A in C}
2014-01-11 06:27:19	Cale	i.e. not the functor C(-,X), but the union of all the sets in its image.
2014-01-11 06:27:28	NickKidman	ah okay, it's just the collection of arrows which kind of forget where there come from, i.e. all arrrows thrown into one set
2014-01-11 06:27:34	NickKidman	yeah
2014-01-11 06:27:35	Cale	yes
2014-01-11 06:28:16	tac	I'm not sure you need to "forget" where they came from
2014-01-11 06:28:18	NickKidman	but I figure you can back from that one to C and hence go back to C->C^op -> Set again
2014-01-11 06:28:22	tac	But you probably don't care too much :)
2014-01-11 06:28:29	Cale	tac: Well, you do, sort of.
2014-01-11 06:28:48	Cale	tac: In that functions between such sets won't care.
2014-01-11 06:29:14	Cale	But natural transformations C(-,X) -> C(-,Y) will care
2014-01-11 06:29:24	NickKidman	okay, so much for the Yoneda embedding. but this is only a special case of the Yoneda lemma, namely if you choose the general functor to be the hom-functor, right?
2014-01-11 06:30:00	Cale	This is the usual version of the Yoneda lemma, which one are you looking at?
2014-01-11 06:30:21	Cale	There are generalisations of it for enriched category theory
2014-01-11 06:31:20	Cale	Well, I guess we haven't actually really talked about the Yoneda lemma proper
2014-01-11 06:32:13	Cale	Which is the statement that for any A in C, and any functor F in Set^(C^op), you have that C(yA,F) = FA.
2014-01-11 06:32:35	Cale	er, rather, that's an isomorphism natural in both F and A
2014-01-11 06:33:19	Cale	er, sorry, also I labelled that incorrectly
2014-01-11 06:33:31	Cale	Which is the statement that for any A in C, and any functor F in Set^(C^op), you have that Set^(C^op)(yA,F) ~= FA.
2014-01-11 06:33:49	Cale	better
2014-01-11 06:35:35	NickKidman	thinking about it
2014-01-11 06:35:36	-->	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-01-11 06:36:09	Cale	Set^(C^op)(yA,F) is the *set* of all natural transformations between yA = C(-,A) and the functor F
2014-01-11 06:36:33	Cale	FA is the *set* which results from applying the functor F: C^op -> Set to the object A
2014-01-11 06:36:43	NickKidman	jo
2014-01-11 06:36:51	Cale	So the isomorphism says that these sets are in bijection
2014-01-11 06:37:04	<--	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-01-11 06:37:10	Cale	and moreover, there are naturality conditions
2014-01-11 06:37:30	-->	Noldorin (~noldorin@unaffiliated/noldorin) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-01-11 06:39:42	Cale	that basically say that it doesn't matter whether you apply this bijection first Set^(C^op)(yA,F) -> FA and then apply some component of a natural transformation theta_A: FA -> GA, or:
2014-01-11 06:40:17	Cale	You lift the natural transformation: Set^(C^op)(yA,theta): Set^(C^op)(yA,F) -> Set^(C^op)(yA,G), and then apply the bijection Set^(C^op)(yA,G) -> GA
2014-01-11 06:40:34	NickKidman	a presheave Set^(C^op) is essentially "one think you can use C for in practive", right?
2014-01-11 06:40:39	NickKidman	prectice
2014-01-11 06:40:53	NickKidman	a presheave in Set^(C^op), I mean
2014-01-11 06:41:03	Cale	hmmm
2014-01-11 06:41:15	engimo	presheaf
2014-01-11 06:41:26	Cale	Maybe there's some sense in which that's kind of true
2014-01-11 06:41:27	NickKidman	engimo: yeah, noticed that
2014-01-11 06:42:10	NickKidman	my intuition for presheaves comes mostly from the cases where C is a topology and the image of the presheave are function spaces above C
2014-01-11 06:42:16	Cale	You can think of C as determining some sort of "structured sets" in that way
2014-01-11 06:42:29	Cale	But for big complicated categories, it gets crazy to think about :)
2014-01-11 06:42:56	Cale	If you have 2 or 3 objects and a handful of arrows, it probably makes the most sense to look at it like that
2014-01-11 06:43:42	Saizan	(i really like that the yoneda lemma is pretty much based path induction expressed as an isomorphism)
2014-01-11 06:44:25	NickKidman	my problem is that if FA isn't empty, that implies that F and C(-,A) are already naturally comparable
2014-01-11 06:44:37	Cale	If you have, say, the category with two objects, and two arrows 0 ==> 1 like that, functors F: C^op -> Set determine directed graphs
2014-01-11 06:44:37	NickKidman	since F can be anything, this is hard to see for me
2014-01-11 06:45:41	Cale	The proof of the Yoneda lemma is "straightforward", but checking it involves more technicalities than at least I can keep in my head all at once.
2014-01-11 06:46:02	Cale	(I would recommend reading the presentation of it in Awodey's book for instance)
2014-01-11 06:46:16	NickKidman	>determine directed graphs
2014-01-11 06:46:17	NickKidman	the image of C in Set is also just two objects, no?
2014-01-11 06:46:24	NickKidman	and two maps
2014-01-11 06:46:26	Cale	yes, two objects with two maps
2014-01-11 06:46:52	Cale	You can think of F 0 as the "vertices", and F 1 as the "arcs"
2014-01-11 06:47:04	NickKidman	oh
2014-01-11 06:47:11	NickKidman	that's mad
2014-01-11 06:47:14	Cale	and you have two arrows F 1 -> F 0 which determine the source and target of each arc
2014-01-11 06:47:54	Cale	http://cale.yi.org/share/S.%20Awodey%20-%20Category%20Theory.pdf (if you don't have it)
2014-01-11 06:48:14	NickKidman	know of it, thx
2014-01-11 06:48:41	Cale	The details of the Yoneda lemma start on page 162
2014-01-11 06:48:52	Cale	But I can also highly recommend the surrounding material
2014-01-11 06:49:43	Cale	lol, he also has the same example as I just gave, apparently that's where I got it from :)
2014-01-11 06:49:46	NickKidman	okay, thanks so far

2014-01-12 14:45:06	augur_	is there a name for categories where Hom(A,C) = Hom(A,B);Hom(B,C) always holds?
2014-01-12 14:45:24	augur_	are such categories always just preorders?
2014-01-12 14:49:56	jgross	What is ';' here?
2014-01-12 14:50:59	jgross	composition?
2014-01-12 14:52:02	augur_	yeah
2014-01-12 14:52:07	augur_	f;g = g.f
2014-01-12 14:53:01	augur_	well
2014-01-12 14:53:03	augur_	its sort of composition
2014-01-12 14:53:05	jgross	I think it's a groupoid, not a preorder
2014-01-12 14:53:08	augur_	its an operation on homsets
2014-01-12 14:53:20	augur_	oh but also on arrows yes
2014-01-12 14:53:21	jgross	You need Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, B); Hom(B, C)
2014-01-12 14:53:34	jgross	er, Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, B); Hom(B, A)
2014-01-12 14:53:39	augur_	aha yes ok
2014-01-12 14:53:45	augur_	so since Hom(A,A) is always non-empty
2014-01-12 14:53:53	augur_	Hom(A,B) and Hom(B,A) have to always be non-empty
2014-01-12 14:55:21	augur_	so that means when Hom(A,A) is just {id_A} then you always have id_A = f.g for all f, g
2014-01-12 14:55:47	jgross	I think every object is uniuqely isomorphic to every other object.
2014-01-12 14:55:55	augur_	maybe?
2014-01-12 14:56:03	augur_	but Hom(A,A) might not be just {id_A}
2014-01-12 14:56:21	jgross	No, Hom(A, A) must be just {id_A}, because of cardinality arguments
2014-01-12 14:56:21	augur_	what if you have id_A /= f : A -> A
2014-01-12 14:56:28	jgross	(If we're working classically)
2014-01-12 14:56:56	jgross	Because Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, A);Hom(A, B)
2014-01-12 14:57:11	jgross	Oh, but I guess some compositions can collapse, so nevermind.
2014-01-12 14:57:21	augur_	right, you might have collapsing compositions
2014-01-12 14:57:33	augur_	so do these compositions always have to collapse to the same thing? hm

2014-01-12 15:01:00	jgross	I think any groupoid will work fine.

2014-01-12 15:09:55	augur_	certainly any preorder will, because homsets are always singletons
2014-01-12 15:10:28	augur_	but i think groupoids are a special kind of preorder right? or no?

2014-01-12 15:49:23	jgross	PreOrders aren't necessarily symmetric.  You need an equivalence relation (preorder + symmetry).   A groupoid is just a proof-relevant equivalence relation.

2014-01-12 18:55:24	Cale	augur_: A preorder for which there's an arrow B -> A whenever you have an arrow A -> B is necessarily a groupoid, because arrows which have the right type to be inverses are necessarily actually inverses.
2014-01-12 18:56:27	Cale	augur_: Groupoids are very different from preorders in general though. Every group can (just like a monoid) be turned into a one-object category in which every arrow is invertible, i.e. a groupoid.
2014-01-12 18:56:44	Cale	But while that has just one object, you have lots of arrows from that object to itself.

2014-01-13 13:08:19	augur_	i think the right categorical semantics of LC should use multicategories, to properly capture the distinction between structure and propositional conjunction
2014-01-13 13:08:36	augur_	and then you can generalize the notion of a multicategory to all sorts of things probably
2014-01-13 13:09:24	augur_	actually, i imagine that the definition of a multicategory fits up perfectly as an intuitionistic proof system
2014-01-13 13:18:00	augur_	and then the structural properties become properties the multicategory
2014-01-13 13:18:41	augur_	eg is Hom(X,Y;Z) the same set as Hom(Y,X;Z)

2014-01-13 13:29:29	augur_	hmm
2014-01-13 13:29:54	augur_	if Ob(C) is a set, then Ob(C) \in |Set

2014-01-13 13:31:25	augur_	but then |Ob(C) is a discrete category, and |Ob(C) * |Ob(C) is also a discrete category
2014-01-13 13:31:46	augur_	so is HomC a functor from |Ob(C) * |Ob(C) to |Set?
2014-01-13 13:32:53	augur_	i should write x not *
2014-01-13 13:33:21	augur_	that would make things nice, because then a multicategory C has HomC : |Ob(C)* x |Ob(C) => |Set

2014-01-16 10:36:57	cads	hmm, I just learned that a pair of events A and B in a probability space (resp. a pair of random variables X and Y) are independent iff the sigma-algebras generated by A and B (X and Y) are independent.

2014-01-17 08:18:54	porton	Every universal construct is a functor. Right?
2014-01-17 08:19:09	tac	Not really
2014-01-17 08:19:33	tac	Universal properties are characterized by the unique existence of some morphism.
2014-01-17 08:19:42	tac	In that sense, they are all initial or terminal objects.
2014-01-17 08:20:00	tac	(if a map is initial in a category C, it's terminal in C^op)
2014-01-17 08:20:40	porton	I've introduced some maps between some categories which are not functors. How to study them with CT?
2014-01-17 08:21:16	tac	Functors are the most natural kind of map between categories
2014-01-17 08:21:46	tac	If your theory is using maps of other kinds, you should be a little suspicious of it.
2014-01-17 08:22:21	tac	It's better to formulate things in terms of functors whenever possible, because functors have proven to be so useful in so many areas of math
2014-01-17 08:22:30	porton	tac: At least two of these 3 maps are quite "natural" (that is are things which should be studied)
2014-01-17 08:22:48	porton	tac: I know that having a functor is an advantage
2014-01-17 08:24:12	noteventime	porton: In what way are they "natural"?
2014-01-17 08:24:14	porton	tac: Can you formulate exactly how to check whether my maps are "universal"?
2014-01-17 08:24:21	noteventime	Perhaps you can make them functors between some derived categories?
2014-01-17 08:24:44	porton	noteventime: One natural thing is that these two maps are Galois connection (in order-theory sense)
2014-01-17 08:25:01	tac	porton: Do you know what a limit or an adjunction is?
2014-01-17 08:25:06	porton	noteventime: Perhaps, but I know no way to do this

2014-01-17 08:25:26	porton	tac: I know on a student level (probably not on researcher level)
2014-01-17 08:26:28	tac	You just need to show that given some situation, there is a unique map that makes everything commute.
2014-01-17 08:26:40	tac	"There exists a unique map" is an existence-and-uniqueness principle.
2014-01-17 08:27:14	tac	It means that, not only is there a way to "fill in" the diagram... because there's only one way, you can't screw it up
2014-01-17 08:27:45	porton	tac: It is clear. However it's unclear for me, how to do this exactly without adjoint functors (as they are not functors at all)
2014-01-17 08:29:33	tac	With adjoint functors, things are a bit more sophisticated, but the main idea is the same: unique existence of some map
2014-01-17 08:29:42	tac	Here, though, you have two categories involved
2014-01-17 08:30:07	porton	Does unique existence of some map imply functors and adjointness?
2014-01-17 08:30:09	tac	with categories going back and forth between them
2014-01-17 08:30:48	porton	tac: Yes, I have back-and-forth maps between two categories, but these maps are just not functors
2014-01-17 08:30:57	tac	yes they are
2014-01-17 08:31:12	tac	For instance, if your categories are Set and Group
2014-01-17 08:31:26	tac	You have Free : Set -> Group, which takes a set to the free group on that set of generators
2014-01-17 08:31:39	tac	and Forget : Group -> Set which takes a group and "forgets" the binary operation and identity
2014-01-17 08:32:08	porton	tac: You give examples with functors. My original question originates from the fact that I have non-functor maps between two categories
2014-01-17 08:32:27	tac	And as I said, if you happened across such a situation, you should be suspicious at it
2014-01-17 08:32:30	tac	of it*
2014-01-17 08:32:58	tac	You can certainly have raw functions between categories... but I don't know of a single instance where that has turned out to be an interesting concept.
2014-01-17 08:33:00	porton	tac: I wondered myself when found that neither of my 3 maps is a functor
2014-01-17 08:33:08	tac	It's like having functions between groups that aren't homomorphisms
2014-01-17 08:33:22	tac	If you think category theory is applicable, you should look for the functors involved.
2014-01-17 08:33:39	tac	If you can't find any functors in your problem, maybe you don't need category theory

2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:28:12] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:28:23] That's the way Awodey means it there anyway
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:28:47] but what about generally (not just awodey)?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:29:09] I've heard it often outside of this lecture, and I'm curious what it really means
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:29:14] There are various technical uses of the term "algebra" to mean various things, and some of them are closely related to this sense of defining some basic components and rules and then looking at structures that satisfy those
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:30:15] what does "calculus" mean, then?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:30:27] In general, it means a way of calculating something
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:31:39] awodey mentions how "algebra of functions" and "lambda calculus" are related but different
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:32:30] what does he mean?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:34:47] The lecture series will explore that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:34:53] He's going to talk about the lambda calculus :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:35:22] Or do you mean in the book somewhere?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:35:29] the lecture
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:35:33] okay, then yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:35:36] I guess I'll encounter it once he gets to it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:36:20] yeah, when he's talking about categories as a sort of abstract algebra of functions, he's just introducing the notion of category by way of the very nice example of the category of sets and functions
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:37:56] I don't understand what you mean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:38:23] you mean the category of sets and functions is an example of categories?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:38:36] Yeah, an example of a category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:38:53] He's taking it as a sort of first example that we're going to generalise away from
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:39:02] I see
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:39:08] btw, what's your background?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:39:45] I have a BMath in pure mathematics from the University of Waterloo, and I've been programming in Haskell since around 2001 or so.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:40:11] (and in other languages for a good bit longer :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:40:47] it seems like Haskell is a popular language for math folks
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:41:28] The way that you tend to think while programming in Haskell has some similar structure to it to the way that you tend to think while proving theorems
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:41:59] (I would say that this applies to programming in general, but it's *especially* true in the case of Haskell and other pure functional programming languages
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:42:01] )
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:42:10] Haskell supports algebraic reasoning
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:42:28] If I know that f x = g x for all x, then I can replace occurrences of f with g in my program
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:42:39] and I know that I haven't screwed things up
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:43:09] I feel like everyone programming on Haskell has a strong math background
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:43:32] Well, not everyone, but it tends to encourage many people to strengthen their math backgrounds
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:43:33] and that I'm at a big disadvantage
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:44:03] You definitely do not need to start out with any mathematics background, or learn any category theory whatsoever, to learn to be a practical Haskell programmer.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:44:03] even when people teach haskell, they teach from a math perspective
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:44:34] But you *will* find that many little scraps of mathematics you pick up will immediately be useful.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:45:10] There are people like Edward Kmett, who has just singlehandedly been translating large swathes of category theory into Haskell libraries.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:45:26] and then finding really clever ways to put those things to use right away :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:45:55] what's a good example of something he put to use right away?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:46:48] So, there's this thing called a codensity monad
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:48:01] ackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-3.7/docs/Control-Monad-Codensity.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:48:03] oops
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:48:07] http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-3.7/docs/Control-Monad-Codensity.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:49:14] This is a sort of specialisation of a much more general thing from category theory, but surprisingly, it has this interesting property that you can take computations written for other monads, and make them use this thing instead, and sometimes it speeds them up.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:50:23] (You can do this trickery in other ways, but it's rather interesting that you can pull this abstract nonsense (I mean that in the nicest possible way) off the shelf, and magically it's beneficial.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:50:39] or this library http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:50:52] actually, this one even moreso: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/profunctors
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:51:06] profunctors get used all over lens
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:51:23] lens is a library which is used to define "functional references"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:51:30] So like, if you have some big datastructure
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:51:39] in Java, say, you might define getters and setters
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:51:54] analogous to views in SQL?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:52:08] lens is like the immutable datastructure analogue of that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:52:10] or more like getters/setters?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:52:43] It gives you lots of tools for defining these things which represent a small part of a larger datastructure, and defines operations for extracting it, or replacing it with another value, or applying functions to it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	shachaf	[15:53:45] But the reasons lens uses profunctors have very little to do with lenses.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:54:00] Well, yeah, it's for additional machinery :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:55:48] (Mostly the stuff surrounding prisms, which are like lenses, but instead of picking out some field of a larger datastructure, they let you pick out some case of a bunch of possible options.)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:56:17] would people who don't have a math background be able to understand and use these advanced (?) libraries?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:56:25] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:56:32] There's a lot of abstraction there
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:56:57] but you can understand it all in mundane terms
2014-01-17 10:23:17	shachaf	[15:56:59] I didn't even know about profunctors when I invented profunctor lenses!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	shachaf	[15:57:28] Fortunately edwardk knew about the abstraction I was trying to get at.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[15:57:45] does the category theory book go over profunctors, codensity monads, etc?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:57:52] No, that's all fancy stuff
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:58:03] (but if you read the book, you can certainly pick it up)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:58:25] You could of course, pick it up in the context of Haskell without even understanding how it generalises to other categories
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:58:34] But it's nice to see that too sometimes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:59:11] The bigger picture is that mathematicians have often already tackled similar sorts of problems in terms of structuring things that we face in designing libraries that are reusable
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[16:00:14] and because category theory is general enough, we can specialise the things down to the context of programming in Haskell and end up with things we can often start finding uses for right away
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[16:03:16] dleedev: Or of course, there's the idea of monads in the first place
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:03:27] Cale: that's true
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:09:38] Cale: time to go. see you later.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[16:09:43] see you!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[21:05:13] topic set in 2012, not the best of signs of life
2014-01-17 10:23:17	ocharles	[21:06:11] notthemessiah: there are pages of conversation in here every day
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[21:09:58] I amend my statement: I guess it only indicates a lack of moderators, not life.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[21:16:57] Is this a good place for beginners? I know a bit about type theory and intuitionistic logic
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[21:17:11] and want to become comfortable enough with categories to apply it to physics
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[21:31:41] a lot of us come from CS too, so it should be fine
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:21:09] anyone else likes "Nat(Hom,F) ~ end c. F(c,c) forall F, natural in F" as a yoneda lemma thing?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[03:22:56] I don't understand the statement
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:35:04] the usual lemma is Nat(Hom(-,c),F) ~ F(c) forall c and F
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:35:36] Nat(F,G) being the set of natural transformations between F and G
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:35:59] and Hom(-,c) being the yoneda embedding applied to c
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:36:13] my version makes it more symmetrical
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:36:45] though in mine F : C^op x C -> Set rather than C^op -> Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:37:28] like Hom as a bigunctor vs Hom partially applied
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:37:34] *bifunctor
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:39:20] end c. F(c,c) is basically saying that F is reflexive, if you think of it as a relation
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[03:43:18] I know the usual Yoneda lemma, but what is end c. F(c,c) ?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[03:46:37] the end of F, http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/end , it's an object in the target category of F with a way to project out F(c,c) for all c
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[03:51:37] Ah, now I can parse it. :-)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[04:05:21] sorry :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[04:05:25] what does end c. F(c, c) mean?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[04:05:43] Is that end as in coend?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	shachaf	[05:25:08] As in the dual of a coend.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[05:28:09] What's a good intro to ends and coends?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:18:01] thats not a topic
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:18:20] any text on introductory category theory would include a discussion
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:23:52] engimo, don't categories cause you to melt? What are you doing giving your usual misinformation in this channel?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:24:28] i am an algebraic topologist, what in the hell are you talking about
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:26:04] I was talking about ends and coends. But apparently they aren't even a real topic. I heard so from a real life algebraic topologist, even!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:26:51] would you say that direct sums are a topic? you're not gonna find a book by someone called "Introduction to Coends and Ends", it's just a thing that shows up when you're studying basic categorical concepts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:27:05] I didn't ask for a book on the subject, did I?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:27:26] that's not my point
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:27:47] They aren't mentioned in Awodey, at least. Which is a counter example to your claim "any text would include a discussion".
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:28:34] Nor are they in the half dozen freely available category theory books I've looked through.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:29:18] sorry, i should have added the caveat "any good text"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:29:37] they're just particular types of (co)limits, theres not much going on
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:29:45] which is why i said it's not really a topic
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:30:16] Well, I'm glad you've split that hair :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tomprince	[06:33:56]  monads are just monoid objects in the endofunctor category. They aren't really a topic.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:34:49] a topic is just an endofunctor on the category of engimos.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tomprince	[06:34:50] And yet, there are hundreds of tutorials on them ...
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:35:36] I wouldn't doubt that there are.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tomprince	[06:35:46] http://blog.sigfpe.com/search?q=coend maybe?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	tac [06:36:49] wonders if he's the only one whose eyes glaze over whenever he sees category theory explained with Haskell explains >___>
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:37:39] So a dinatural transformation is a generalization of Hom to an arbitrary target category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:38:48] ahh. I remember seeing that funny double-dotted arrow syntax before and not quite "getting" it. But it's something like embedding a category into another category, isn't it?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tomprince	[06:42:50] http://comonad.com/reader/index.php?s=coend maybe too.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[13:19:51] augur: Do you still have your work on implementing variational operators in agda?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur	[13:22:06] notthemessiah: hi hello what
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur	[13:22:09] variational operators?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[13:22:36] calculus of variations
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur	[13:22:48] did i implement that in agda?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[13:25:18] dunno, was looking around to see if anyone tried to formulate classical mechanics in agda or coq, and this log came up: http://agda.orangesquash.org.uk/2012/April/01.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur	[13:25:51] oh.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur	[13:25:57] no i never really got anywhere with that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	notthemessiah	[13:27:41] ahh, I had the intention of attempting something similar
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:02:46] hi, I have a question about endofunctors
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:02:58] an endofunctor is a functor that maps from one category back to the exact same category, right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[16:08:20] dleedev: that's what I understand it to be, yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:09:38] bishboria: so what's the difference between an endofunctor and an identity functor?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[16:17:42] Endofunctors don't have to map objects/arrows within the category to themselves, whereas an identity functor does.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:20:55] bishboria: can you give a very basic example of an endofunctor that isn't an identity functor?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[16:46:05] A simple one might be: Set category Int -> Nat
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[16:47:14] Sorry for the delay, I'm on my way to work :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[16:50:52] dleedev: Take the catgory Top and the functor that F: Top -> Top; F(T) = * and F(S -> T) = id_*. It is an endofunctor, but not the identity
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:52:20] mr-: sorry, I don't know what * means
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:53:54] actually, I don't even know what Top is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:55:06] bishboria: what would F: Int -> Nat be?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[16:56:25] An endofunctor that isn't an identity functor
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[16:57:27] dleedev: what categories do you know?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:58:56] mr-: none, actually
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:59:23] bishboria: I meant, what would the example endofunctor from Int -> Nat look like?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:59:42] mr-: I guess monoid is a category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[16:59:58] mr-: preorder is another
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:02:12] dleedev: that's a bit inprecise. There is a category of all monoids, every set with a preorder gives you a category and there is a category of all sets with preorders.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:02:53] dleedev: Do you know the category of sets (Set) ?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:03:05] mr-: no, but I can learn :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:03:57] dleedev: an object of Set is a set, given two sets A, B the morphisms from A to B are just functions A -> B
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:04:14] mr-: got it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:04:40] mr-: what would be an example of an endofunctor Set -> Set that is not an identity functor?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:05:25] dleedev: A functor F: Set -> Set is something that gives you a set F(S) for every set S and for every map f: A -> B it has to give you a map F(f): F(A) -> F(B), right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:06:10] mr-: yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:06:19] dleedev: now consider the functor F(S) = {1} for all S and F(f) = id_{1}. Is it an endofunctor?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:07:00] mr-: no, because it got rid of a lot of objects and morphisms
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:07:39] dleedev: But that's not the definition of "Endofunctor". An Endofunctor really is just a functor Set -> Set in this case.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:07:43] mr-: the resulting category has 1 object and 1 morphism
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:08:01] the resulting category ≠ Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:08:04] it does not have to be surjecitve in any sense
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:10:29] are you saying the resulting category = Set?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:11:05] perhaps I'm misunderstanding what a functor "Set -> Set" means
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:12:32] is "Set" the name of the category, or is it the name of the kind of category?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:16:07] mr-: I've seen the definition of endofuctor as "A functor that maps a category to itself"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:19:55] mr-: the first category has A and B as objects, whereas the resulting category has {1} as the object
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:20:15] mr-: I don't see how the first category is the same as the resulting category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:20:58] {1} = set of 1
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:22:20] bishboria: I understand that, but that set's the only object that the resulting category has
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:22:33] bishboria: while the original category had all possible sets as objects
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:22:47] how are the two categories equal?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:22:51] It's still a set in the category of Sets
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:23:21] it might not be complicated, or do very much, but it's still in the same category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:23:48] I understand that {1} is in both the first category and the result category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:24:09] but the first category has other sets as objects, such as {2}, whereas the resulting category does not have {2} as an object
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:24:30] the first category and the resulting category are not equal
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:24:56] the first category = "the category of all sets", the resulting category = "the category of the set {1}"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:25:10] bishboria: am I misunderstanding something?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:25:55] dleedev: you are misunderstanding something
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:26:05] {1} is a set, so it is an object in Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:26:22] mr-: I understand that, it's an object in the first category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:26:31] dleedev: in the same way that f(n) = 1 is a function N -> N
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:26:43] (where N is the natural numbers)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:27:49] dleedev: does that make sense to you?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:28:37] mr-: kind of
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:28:45] mr-: so does the resulting category include {2}?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:29:56] dleedev: what do you mean with "resulting category"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:30:08] dleedev: {2} is not in the _image_ of the functor
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:30:24] dleedev: (it is in the essential image, but all that is besides the point)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:30:28] mr-: given functor F: A -> B, what do you call A and what do you call B?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:30:40] mr-: what's analogous to "domain" and "codomain" in category?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:30:53] dleedev: probably domain and codomain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:31:58] dleedev: mr-'s f: N -> N; f n = 1 is a good way to think of a concrete example
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:32:30] dleedev: the point it, that the functor F: Set -> Set, F(S) = {1}, F(f) = id_{1} has Domain Set and Codomain Set. (But its Image is {1})
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:32:34] mr-: OK, now I'm beginning to understand
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:32:53] s/the point it/the point is/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:33:43] mr- and bishboria thanks so much
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:33:54] dleedev: you have been confusing the image with the codomain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:34:37] mr-: yes, exactly
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:36:07] dleedev: now you can ask a better question, though: Are there endofunctors that are (essentially) surjective that are not the identity? (The answer is still yes)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:36:30] mr-: I'll ask that when I remember what "surjective" means :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:36:50] mr-: My confusion was due to the fact that nowhere in category theory literature does it refer to functor F : A -> B as a mapping between "domain" A and "codomain" B
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:36:59] mr-: they never use the terms domain and codomain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:37:35] mr-: so when they say "mapping" I'm thinking "value" A -> "value" B
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:37:55] dleedev: Page 5 of Steve Awodey's Category Theory book does :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:38:26] dleedev: even when people say "mapping" they don't imply that you have to hit every value in the codomain (that's what surjective is)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:39:54] bishboria: are you referring to Deﬁnition 1.1?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:40:05] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:40:19] bishboria: that's not talking about a functor's domain/codomain, that's talking about an arrow's domain/codomain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:41:57] mr-: but people usually use "mapping" to describe value to value, not domain to codomain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:41:58] dleedev: just think of a functor as a function (that also has to do something reasonable to morphisms)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:42:14] dleedev: not really, at least not in math
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:42:37] mr-: OK, maybe that's why... I don't have a math background
2014-01-17 10:23:17	bishboria	[17:42:41] category theory is more abstract than value to value
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:43:33] bishboria: yes, I understand that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:43:51] I think my overall confusion was due to a misunderstand of "mapping"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:44:19] most definitions using "mapping" in the mathematic sense of domain to codomain, whereas I was understanding it to mean value to value
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:45:18] btw, you both have helped me clear a major frustration in understanding category theory
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:45:20] many many thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:45:22] dleedev: I think it might be good for you to try to find examples for the definitions you are trying to understand.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:46:21] mr-: yes, that's what I try to do
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:46:37] mr-: it's why I started by asking for examples :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:46:48] (also note that functors in CT are vastly more general than functors in Haskell)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:47:03] btw, why is category theory called that? Why "category"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:51:18] I don't know. But a category is a collection of objects that share some properties.. There are only so many names for "a bunch of things"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:51:38] mr-: haha, that's true
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:51:55] mr-: Set, Ring, and Group are taken :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:52:24] mr-: I feel like a better name would have been Arrow Theory
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:52:37] mr-: there's even a motto: "It's all about the arrows!"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:52:54] That's true
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:20:56] http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1uqsjs/category_theory_ends_1_aka_thecatsters_are_back/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pedro3005	[07:06:41] hey tac
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[10:57:28] hi, in awodey's book, it says that "for any set X, the set of functions from X to X is a monoid under the operation of composition"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[10:57:57] shouldn't there be an additional condition that the set of functions from X to X include the identity function?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[10:59:08] or is the identity function implied to exist for any set X?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[10:59:16] it does, yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[11:00:13] copumpkin: is that part of the definition of a set?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:00:19] what
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:00:32] its not an implication, it just does
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:00:46] given a set, there is an identity function, always
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[11:01:28] engimo: so it's part of the definition of a set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:01:34] no, it's not
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[11:01:37] more like the definition of a function
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:01:41] what are you talking about
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:01:54] you have a set, there is an associated set of functions from that set to itself
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[11:02:00] if you consider a function to be a particular type of binary relation
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:02:01] there is always an identity function
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[11:02:46] it's not "part of the definition", but it follows from basic axioms
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[11:02:49] engimo: What kind of set are you talking about?  A ZFC set?  An ETCS set?  A colloquial set?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:02:59] i dont care
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:03:34] if any of the things don't have what i just said, said thing is fucked up
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[11:04:02] copumpkin: You're talking about a ZFC set, right?  For an ETCS set, it's part of the definition of a category (that all objects have an identity morphism), right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[11:04:53] yeah, or some "traditional" set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	copumpkin	[11:05:06] since it is one of the axioms of a category and thus follows more immediately
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:11:23] engimo: You spend an awfully lot of time concerning yourself about things you don't care about
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[11:12:01] while that might be true, the interpretation of what i just said was "it shouldn't matter"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	drbean	[10:48:11] https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~devriese/ct/catsters/linear.php is back.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[04:04:06] Can one say that for any category C, the images of functors C->Set contain all information about C. I.e. are the functors to Set indeed special, and which we still can and want to look at functors from C to other abstract categories D, the real results one is initially motivated in always relate to representations of C in the set language?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:04:46] NickKidman: hmm... well, the Yoneda lemma says that we can take C and embed it via the functor y into the category of functors C^op -> Set, and moreover when we do this, each f: A -> B in C is sent to a unique arrow yf: yA -> yB, and every arrow yA -> yB is the image of some arrow A -> B.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:05:46] NickKidman: The category of functors C^op -> Set has a lot of nice properties: it's complete and cocomplete (i.e. has all small limits and colimits), it has exponentials, it's a topos, and so on.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:06:26] (you can interpret Coq in it :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:06:46] it's a pre-sheaf I guess, or at least almost
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:06:49] NickKidman: and so this lets us use a category with all the fancy widgets we could ever want, in order to reason about out possibly deficient category C.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:06:50] our*
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:07:10] but do you automatically have the Yoneda embedding, don't you need the existence of any functor beforehand?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:07:12] Yeah, that's the definition of a presheaf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:07:24] It's automatic
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:08:08] but...aren't there categories without faithful functors to Set?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:08:09] It's just: A |--> Hom(-,A)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:08:36] and then there must be some information which is hidden if we only consider representations in Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:09:26] Hom(-,A) being the functor C^op -> Set which sends an object X in C to the set Hom(X,A), and a function f: X -> Y in C (so f: Y -> X in C^op) to the set function Hom(Y,A) -> Hom(X,A) by composition.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[06:09:48] NickKidman: it's not a faithful functor _to_ set. The functor C -> C^Set is what Cale is talking about
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[06:10:07] err..
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:10:11] i.e. if we start with some g: Y -> A, and we have f: X -> Y, then we can compose g . f : X -> A
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[06:10:22] never mind me... too tired
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:10:29] and that defines a function between these Hom sets
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:11:14] So, yeah, it's not Set that we're embedding C in here, it's a category of functors to Set.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:12:25] As it happens, we can also always get a functor C -> Set, but it won't usually have the embedding properties I mentioned where the functor is a bijection on the arrows between corresponding pairs of objects
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:12:32] should I think of the Yoneda embedding on objects (A being mapped to homs into A) as the realization of the idea "a set is determined by the maps into it"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:14:32] and in order to do that, you can always just send each object X in C to the set {f : A in C, f: A -> X} of all arrows whose codomain is X, and then a function f: X -> Y is sent to the function which sends each g: A -> X to some f . g: A -> Y
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:14:47] But that's a different thing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:15:05] It's not unrelated
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:15:15] But we're throwing away a lot of structure there
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:16:35] I lose track of what you're refering to. What is a different thing? And what does the first half of "{f : A in C, f: A -> X} " mean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:16:48] Oh, maybe I should have written that with a |
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:16:56] {f | A in C, f: A -> X}
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:17:01] It's a set comprehension
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:17:15] okay
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:17:20] The set of all arrows f such that A is an object in C, and f: A -> X
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:17:33] and what is "not unrelated"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:17:41] and to what
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:18:31] So, above, earlier, I gave a way to construct a functor C -> Set^(C^op), but this latter construction is just a functor C -> Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:19:51] The sets we're assigning to the objects of C though are in some way imprecise representations of the original objects of C, in that not all set functions between these sets of arrows will actually come from composition with some arrow in C.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:20:10] Only *some* of the set functions will actually be representations of arrows in C like that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:20:33] But when you do the real Yoneda embedding, from C to Set^(C^op), it's better
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:21:01] When you look at two functors in the image, the natural transformations between them *exactly* correspond bijectively to arrows in C.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:21:31] It's just that Set^(C^op) has many more objects than C had in general.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:22:30] okay, yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:23:09] the objects of Set^(C^op) are not just, speaking in set theoretic terms, the global elements, but all the generalized elements
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:23:30] the objects of Set^(C^op) are not just, speaking in set theoretic terms, the sets of global elements, but the sets of all the generalized elements
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:24:05] Well, even my other construction of a functor C -> Set was producing the set of all generalised elements for each object in C.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:24:57] The functor C(-,A) : C^op -> Set which is the image of some object A under the Yoneda embedding has more structure though.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:25:29] It's the generalised elements of A arranged into a functor which is parameterised over the object you choose for the domain
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:26:08] okay yeah. what is the "other construction of a functor C -> Set"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:26:09] ?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:26:43] Send the object X to the set of all arrows {f: A -> X | A in C}
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:27:19] i.e. not the functor C(-,X), but the union of all the sets in its image.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:27:28] ah okay, it's just the collection of arrows which kind of forget where there come from, i.e. all arrrows thrown into one set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:27:34] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:27:35] yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:28:16] I'm not sure you need to "forget" where they came from
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:28:18] but I figure you can back from that one to C and hence go back to C->C^op -> Set again
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[06:28:22] But you probably don't care too much :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:28:29] tac: Well, you do, sort of.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:28:48] tac: In that functions between such sets won't care.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:29:14] But natural transformations C(-,X) -> C(-,Y) will care
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:29:24] okay, so much for the Yoneda embedding. but this is only a special case of the Yoneda lemma, namely if you choose the general functor to be the hom-functor, right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:30:00] This is the usual version of the Yoneda lemma, which one are you looking at?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:30:21] There are generalisations of it for enriched category theory
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:31:20] Well, I guess we haven't actually really talked about the Yoneda lemma proper
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:32:13] Which is the statement that for any A in C, and any functor F in Set^(C^op), you have that C(yA,F) = FA.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:32:35] er, rather, that's an isomorphism natural in both F and A
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:33:19] er, sorry, also I labelled that incorrectly
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:33:31] Which is the statement that for any A in C, and any functor F in Set^(C^op), you have that Set^(C^op)(yA,F) ~= FA.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:33:49] better
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:35:35] thinking about it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:36:09] Set^(C^op)(yA,F) is the *set* of all natural transformations between yA = C(-,A) and the functor F
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:36:33] FA is the *set* which results from applying the functor F: C^op -> Set to the object A
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:36:43] jo
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:36:51] So the isomorphism says that these sets are in bijection
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:37:10] and moreover, there are naturality conditions
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:39:42] that basically say that it doesn't matter whether you apply this bijection first Set^(C^op)(yA,F) -> FA and then apply some component of a natural transformation theta_A: FA -> GA, or:
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:40:17] You lift the natural transformation: Set^(C^op)(yA,theta): Set^(C^op)(yA,F) -> Set^(C^op)(yA,G), and then apply the bijection Set^(C^op)(yA,G) -> GA
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:40:34] a presheave Set^(C^op) is essentially "one think you can use C for in practive", right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:40:39] prectice
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:40:53] a presheave in Set^(C^op), I mean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:41:03] hmmm
2014-01-17 10:23:17	engimo	[06:41:15] presheaf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:41:26] Maybe there's some sense in which that's kind of true
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:41:27] engimo: yeah, noticed that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:42:10] my intuition for presheaves comes mostly from the cases where C is a topology and the image of the presheave are function spaces above C
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:42:16] You can think of C as determining some sort of "structured sets" in that way
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:42:29] But for big complicated categories, it gets crazy to think about :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:42:56] If you have 2 or 3 objects and a handful of arrows, it probably makes the most sense to look at it like that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Saizan	[06:43:42] (i really like that the yoneda lemma is pretty much based path induction expressed as an isomorphism)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:44:25] my problem is that if FA isn't empty, that implies that F and C(-,A) are already naturally comparable
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:44:37] If you have, say, the category with two objects, and two arrows 0 ==> 1 like that, functors F: C^op -> Set determine directed graphs
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:44:37] since F can be anything, this is hard to see for me
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:45:41] The proof of the Yoneda lemma is "straightforward", but checking it involves more technicalities than at least I can keep in my head all at once.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:46:02] (I would recommend reading the presentation of it in Awodey's book for instance)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:46:16] >determine directed graphs
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:46:17] the image of C in Set is also just two objects, no?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:46:24] and two maps
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:46:26] yes, two objects with two maps
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:46:52] You can think of F 0 as the "vertices", and F 1 as the "arcs"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:47:04] oh
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:47:11] that's mad
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:47:14] and you have two arrows F 1 -> F 0 which determine the source and target of each arc
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:47:54] http://cale.yi.org/share/S.%20Awodey%20-%20Category%20Theory.pdf (if you don't have it)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:48:14] know of it, thx
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:48:41] The details of the Yoneda lemma start on page 162
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:48:52] But I can also highly recommend the surrounding material
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[06:49:43] lol, he also has the same example as I just gave, apparently that's where I got it from :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	NickKidman	[06:49:46] okay, thanks so far
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[09:53:42] hey, anyone here familiar with the categorical approach to game theoretical semantics?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[09:56:32] http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/18/2/18-02abs.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[10:58:01] oh what's this?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[11:03:06] I think it's related to some of the work on a game semantics for linear logic
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:27:57] cads: logic is no game
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:27:58] it's serious
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:28:07] think of the philosophical remifications of it all!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[11:28:38] sure, but we can model logic as games being played between arguing philosophers
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:29:13] philosophers would never be able to agree on which verson of the rules they are using
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[11:29:21] then a statement P is true if a philosopher arguing for P has a smart response to any criticism made by a philosopher arguing against P
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:29:23] the game would be ill-suited for tournament place
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[11:29:24] play*
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[11:29:53] hehe, maybe not
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[01:15:41] hey guys, is there any setting in which a categorical limit corresponds to a limit in the analytic sense?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[02:22:52] cads: yes, consider the real numbers as a poset
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[02:23:40] cads: that way you can get the supremum as a colimit
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:42:32] hm
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:43:33] define   Hom(A,B);Hom(B,C) = { f;g | f in Hom(A,B), g in Hom(B,C) } <= Hom(A,C)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:45:06] is there a name for categories where Hom(A,C) = Hom(A,B);Hom(B,C) always holds?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:45:24] are such categories always just preorders?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:49:56] What is ';' here?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:50:59] composition?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:52:02] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:52:07] f;g = g.f
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:01] well
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:03] its sort of composition
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:53:05] I think it's a groupoid, not a preorder
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:08] its an operation on homsets
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:20] oh but also on arrows yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:53:21] You need Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, B); Hom(B, C)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:53:34] er, Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, B); Hom(B, A)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:39] aha yes ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:45] so since Hom(A,A) is always non-empty
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:53:53] Hom(A,B) and Hom(B,A) have to always be non-empty
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:55:21] so that means when Hom(A,A) is just {id_A} then you always have id_A = f.g for all f, g
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:55:47] I think every object is uniuqely isomorphic to every other object.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:55:55] maybe?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:56:03] but Hom(A,A) might not be just {id_A}
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:56:21] No, Hom(A, A) must be just {id_A}, because of cardinality arguments
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:56:21] what if you have id_A /= f : A -> A
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:56:28] (If we're working classically)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:56:56] Because Hom(A, A) = Hom(A, A);Hom(A, B)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:57:11] Oh, but I guess some compositions can collapse, so nevermind.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:57:21] right, you might have collapsing compositions
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:57:33] so do these compositions always have to collapse to the same thing? hm
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[15:00:37] What if you have objects a, b, and morphisms 0, 1 between every pair of objects, and composition max?  Then every morphism factors through any other object (by compsition with the appropriate '0').
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[15:01:00] I think any groupoid will work fine.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[15:09:40] jgross: perhaps
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[15:09:55] certainly any preorder will, because homsets are always singletons
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[15:10:28] but i think groupoids are a special kind of preorder right? or no?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[15:49:23] PreOrders aren't necessarily symmetric.  You need an equivalence relation (preorder + symmetry).   A groupoid is just a proof-relevant equivalence relation.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[18:55:24] augur_: A preorder for which there's an arrow B -> A whenever you have an arrow A -> B is necessarily a groupoid, because arrows which have the right type to be inverses are necessarily actually inverses.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[18:56:27] augur_: Groupoids are very different from preorders in general though. Every group can (just like a monoid) be turned into a one-object category in which every arrow is invertible, i.e. a groupoid.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[18:56:44] But while that has just one object, you have lots of arrows from that object to itself.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[00:32:01] Cale: ah yes ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[08:07:23] are there any adjunction-like things that have something other that 1?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[08:08:24] like, for some functor I =/= 1,   eta : I => FG   epsilon : GF => I
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[08:08:41] with interesting or useful properties?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[09:16:43] hmm, that'd be neat
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[09:17:32] you can use them do define "even-mo!"-nads
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[09:23:10] ie, there are now a whole lot mo
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:08:19] i think the right categorical semantics of LC should use multicategories, to properly capture the distinction between structure and propositional conjunction
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:08:36] and then you can generalize the notion of a multicategory to all sorts of things probably
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:09:24] actually, i imagine that the definition of a multicategory fits up perfectly as an intuitionistic proof system
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:18:00] and then the structural properties become properties the multicategory
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:18:41] eg is Hom(X,Y;Z) the same set as Hom(Y,X;Z)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:29:29] hmm
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:29:54] if Ob(C) is a set, then Ob(C) \in |Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:31:25] but then |Ob(C) is a discrete category, and |Ob(C) * |Ob(C) is also a discrete category
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:31:46] so is HomC a functor from |Ob(C) * |Ob(C) to |Set?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:32:53] i should write x not *
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[13:33:21] that would make things nice, because then a multicategory C has HomC : |Ob(C)* x |Ob(C) => |Set
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[12:50:27] if there are categories C and D, and a functor F : C -> D, is C called a domain and D codomain?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[12:50:47] what are the appropriate CT terms analogous to "domain" and "codomain"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	ski	[13:44:26] i think "domain" and "codomain" is fine
2014-01-17 10:23:17	ski	[13:45:14] (i might have seen "source" and "target" used, as well, but "domain" and "codomain" are probably the most common)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[14:46:23] ski: thanks for the answer
2014-01-17 10:23:17	mr-	[17:02:11] dleedev: are you going to ask that question every other day now? :-)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:03:07] mr-: :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:03:20] I keep forgetting if I got an answer, because every time the answer is vague
2014-01-17 10:23:17	dleedev	[17:03:43] so because I'm unsure what to call it in my mind, I end up asking again
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[10:36:57] hmm, I just learned that a pair of events A and B in a probability space (resp. a pair of random variables X and Y) are independent iff the sigma-algebras generated by A and B (X and Y) are independent.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[10:37:51] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)#Independent_.CF.83-algebras
2014-01-17 10:23:17	cads	[10:40:15] it's like they just lift the constructions into the category of sigma algebras
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:26:35] i wonder if its possible to mechanically derive "obvious" laws
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:26:41]  /equations
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:27:51] that is to say, given just the definition of, say, a monad, could the laws for a monad algebra be derived mechanically, since they're "obvious"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[14:34:23] augur: Do you think this might be true also of, e.g., the coherence laws for pseudofunctor and pseudonatural transformation?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:34:42] jgross: i dont know, since i dont know if its true at all!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	augur_	[14:34:46] but i would wonder if its true!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:37:47] augur_: Or given the types of the natural transformations making up a monad, could the axioms (associativity and left/right inverse) be derived automatically?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cale	[15:38:50] augur_: In that case, I can almost imagine defining some kind of general framework for it -- given some finite system of functors and natural transformations, to derive the "obvious" laws for them.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:18:54] Every universal construct is a functor. Right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:19:09] Not really
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:19:33] Universal properties are characterized by the unique existence of some morphism.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:19:42] In that sense, they are all initial or terminal objects.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:20:00] (if a map is initial in a category C, it's terminal in C^op)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:20:40] I've introduced some maps between some categories which are not functors. How to study them with CT?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:21:16] Functors are the most natural kind of map between categories
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:21:46] If your theory is using maps of other kinds, you should be a little suspicious of it.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:22:21] It's better to formulate things in terms of functors whenever possible, because functors have proven to be so useful in so many areas of math
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:22:30] tac: At least two of these 3 maps are quite "natural" (that is are things which should be studied)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:22:48] tac: I know that having a functor is an advantage
2014-01-17 10:23:17	noteventime	[08:24:12] porton: In what way are they "natural"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:24:14] tac: Can you formulate exactly how to check whether my maps are "universal"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	noteventime	[08:24:21] Perhaps you can make them functors between some derived categories?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:24:44] noteventime: One natural thing is that these two maps are Galois connection (in order-theory sense)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:25:01] porton: Do you know what a limit or an adjunction is?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:25:06] noteventime: Perhaps, but I know no way to do this
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:25:26] tac: I know on a student level (probably not on researcher level)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:26:28] You just need to show that given some situation, there is a unique map that makes everything commute.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:26:40] "There exists a unique map" is an existence-and-uniqueness principle.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:27:14] It means that, not only is there a way to "fill in" the diagram... because there's only one way, you can't screw it up
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:27:45] tac: It is clear. However it's unclear for me, how to do this exactly without adjoint functors (as they are not functors at all)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:29:33] With adjoint functors, things are a bit more sophisticated, but the main idea is the same: unique existence of some map
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:29:42] Here, though, you have two categories involved
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:30:07] Does unique existence of some map imply functors and adjointness?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:30:09] with categories going back and forth between them
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:30:48] tac: Yes, I have back-and-forth maps between two categories, but these maps are just not functors
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:30:57] yes they are
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:31:12] For instance, if your categories are Set and Group
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:31:26] You have Free : Set -> Group, which takes a set to the free group on that set of generators
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:31:39] and Forget : Group -> Set which takes a group and "forgets" the binary operation and identity
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:32:08] tac: You give examples with functors. My original question originates from the fact that I have non-functor maps between two categories
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:32:27] And as I said, if you happened across such a situation, you should be suspicious at it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:32:30] of it*
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:32:58] You can certainly have raw functions between categories... but I don't know of a single instance where that has turned out to be an interesting concept.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:33:00] tac: I wondered myself when found that neither of my 3 maps is a functor
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:33:08] It's like having functions between groups that aren't homomorphisms
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:33:22] If you think category theory is applicable, you should look for the functors involved.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	tac	[08:33:39] If you can't find any functors in your problem, maybe you don't need category theory
2014-01-17 10:23:17	porton	[08:33:56] tac: It is clear. I thought about it, but found no functors involved. It's weird, but it is so
2014-01-17 10:23:17	jgross	[10:07:22] porton: Maybe you're looking at the wrong categories, or your categories are secretly higher-categorical.  How exactly does functorial-ness fail?  (Also, Wikipedia says "Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a category in a natural way: there is a unique morphism from x to y if and only if x ≤ y. A monotone Galois connection is then nothing but a pair of adjoint functors between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets.")

2014-01-18 08:01:00	Saizan	notdan: the general notion of cofree is "right adjoint to a forgetful functor"

2014-01-18 09:39:29	augur	cads: so it requires a little background but
2014-01-18 09:39:58	augur	consider lists of lists of words W**
2014-01-18 09:40:18	augur	or lets be more precise, vectors of lists of words, so lets just use agda: Vec (List W) n
2014-01-18 09:41:00	augur	and now also imagine a related notion of an n-hole context -- a list of words with n holes in it
2014-01-18 09:41:35	augur	eg   `foo bar _ baz _`   has two holes in it where the _'s are
2014-01-18 09:41:53	augur	call those Context W n
2014-01-18 09:42:23	augur	obviously you can interleave these, inserting the i-th component of a vector into the i-th hole of an n-hole context
2014-01-18 09:43:27	augur	so that if you have   p : Vec (List W) n   and   k : Context W n   then   interleave p k : List W

2014-01-18 09:43:45	augur	lets just write that p@k infact
2014-01-18 09:44:14	augur	you can also imagine just inserting a single List W into the i-th hole of an n-hole context: write it   k[xs/i]
2014-01-18 09:44:33	augur	and you can delete the i-th component of an n-length Vec:   p\i
2014-01-18 09:45:26	augur	it holds that   p@k = (p\i)@(k[p!i/i])
2014-01-18 09:46:00	augur	that should sort of make sense: if you interleave p into k, it's the same as putting the i-th part of p into k, then removing it from p, and interleaving that instead
2014-01-18 09:46:50	augur	ok so how suppose you have the set O_p = { k | p@k is a grammatical sentence }
2014-01-18 09:47:40	augur	what's the relationship between   O_p and O_{p\i}? and more over, given i /= j, what's the relationship between O_p, O_{p\i} and O_{p\j}?
2014-01-18 09:48:58	augur	well it turns out that O_p is a subset of O_{p\i}, and for i /= j, i think its the case that O_p forms a pullback over O_{p\i\k}, with the projections being the inclusions into O_{p\i} and O_{p\j}
2014-01-18 09:49:44	augur	more or less this just describes the fact that substitution into n-hole contexts is order-independent
2014-01-18 09:50:06	augur	but it also has the fun consequence of telling you something about the relationship between different p's
2014-01-18 09:51:15	augur	because each p is a list of lists of words, so you might ask how does each the contexts for each component contribute to the contexts of the whole thing
2014-01-18 09:51:37	augur	if you have O_p and O_p', how do those relate to O_{p++p'}?
2014-01-18 09:52:29	augur	well it turns out, i think, that O_{p++p'} just is a pullback! which is a nice simple explanation
2014-01-18 09:54:34	augur	its also constructively provable, without using true sets but just using predicates on word strings, which is super nice
2014-01-18 09:55:50	augur	its really not a complicated thing, conceptually
2014-01-18 09:56:02	augur	but its a nice little theoremy facty thing so

2014-01-18 10:15:50	cads	that reminds me of some similar results in milner's theory of bigraphical reactive systems
2014-01-18 10:17:15	cads	oh, vectors are just hole free contexts and it makes sense to interleave contexts too
2014-01-18 10:20:20	augur	ehh
2014-01-18 10:20:32	cads	here if you're interleaving the ith component of a context B into the n-th hole of a context A, and B!i is a hole, then (B@A)!i remains a hole
2014-01-18 10:20:49	augur	contexts are in a sense vectors of lists too, its just tricky when you think of it that way
2014-01-18 10:21:39	augur	at least, it's tricky if you dont have a good story on where the holes are
2014-01-18 10:22:15	augur	but also, a context is supposed to represent a whole expression, minus some parts
2014-01-18 10:22:27	augur	they're kind of the same but not quite, i guess? i dont know.
2014-01-18 10:23:19	cads	oh, right... lists of sentences are deeper
2014-01-18 10:23:45	cads	though they're equivalent to a single sentence with line breaks
2014-01-18 10:24:05	augur	yeah you can code them up various ways
2014-01-18 10:26:42	augur	the problem with treating these ideas as the same tho is that if you have potentially empty parts, then an n-component p can be turned into an n+1-component p by adding an empty component on either end
2014-01-18 10:27:09	augur	maybe thats good, i dont know

2014-01-19 03:47:01	Cale	Well, that's Coq
2014-01-19 03:47:20	mr-	does not look so nice ;)
2014-01-19 03:47:53	Cale	Coq proofs are typically unreadable without actually running the proof assistant
2014-01-19 03:48:37	Cale	You can't see certain things that you need to in order to make sense of what's going on (i.e. the goals and hypotheses) without actually having Coq running.
2014-01-19 03:50:58	Cale	Has anyone tried defining categories where the homs are types?
2014-01-19 03:51:31	Cale	(which would be like (infinity, 1)-categories, I suppose)
2014-01-19 03:53:46	Cale	expo987: Did you still need help with that question you had earlier? I assume that was just in the category of sets?
2014-01-19 03:54:20	mr-	The HoTT book defines hom-sets (set in the typey sense)
2014-01-19 03:55:35	Cale	mr-: yeah
2014-01-19 03:55:36	Cale	mr-: It would be nice to see a presentation of categories which generalised them to types
2014-01-19 03:55:50	Cale	The other thing I'm rather curious about is what happens to the HoTT Cauchy real numbers if you don't throw in the additional path constructors to truncate them
2014-01-19 03:58:38	Cale	At some point I should try modifying the existing code for them and see if I can determine anything interesting, like see if I can find some sign that those path spaces which had been explicitly truncated really are nontrivial.
2014-01-19 04:00:15	Cale	Maybe try to calculate the fundamental group of some real numbers :D
2014-01-19 04:00:51	mr-	hehe
2014-01-19 04:01:16	mr-	and see if 0 is the circle :-)
2014-01-19 04:01:35	Cale	I bet they're all horribly complicated infinite groups
2014-01-19 04:02:49	Cale	But are they all even isomorphic to each other?
2014-01-19 04:02:52	Cale	It seems possible that yes they are
2014-01-19 04:03:51	Cale	But not obvious :)
2014-01-19 04:05:40	mr-	yeah
2014-01-19 04:08:25	Cale	When I saw that truncation, it made me a little sad, because it's like we had a chance to see some new finer structure in the real numbers, and threw it away (likely for very good practical reasons, but nonetheless...)
2014-01-19 04:09:27	Cale	It's probably rather hard to define maps R -> R properly when you don't have that truncation to help

2014-01-19 05:43:17	Cale	It would certainly be nice for Coq itself to be able to elaborate your scripts with notes about what's happening with the goals and assumptions, but you'd likely want that to be somewhat less than the full display in between every pair of lines of the proof.
2014-01-19 05:44:24	Cale	Even then, we need better tactics for HoTT, and/or "real" higher inductive types.
2014-01-19 05:45:04	Cale	The induction tactic unsurprisingly is unhelpful at present.

2014-01-19 05:57:10	augur	im still not sold on HoTT
2014-01-19 05:58:24	copumpkin	what's to be sold on?
2014-01-19 05:59:39	augur	its sensibility, and its utility :P
2014-01-19 05:59:57	copumpkin	utility over standard ITT, or something else like OTT?
2014-01-19 06:00:09	augur	either, really
2014-01-19 06:00:24	copumpkin	do you see why many others are excited?
2014-01-19 06:00:32	augur	nope
2014-01-19 06:00:50	copumpkin	being able to prove more things equal is cool :)
2014-01-19 06:00:54	copumpkin	because you get subst
2014-01-19 06:01:02	augur	all i can see is a bunch of cute little examples that dont seem all that useful
2014-01-19 06:01:29	augur	but then, i dont have the background most HoTT people do, so i cant see the potential that they can
2014-01-19 06:01:48	augur	im not saying its useless, just that i havent been able to figure out why
2014-01-19 06:01:57	copumpkin	it allows us to transport properties across equal things
2014-01-19 06:02:15	copumpkin	so you might prove that your fancy algorithm is equivalent to the simple, obviously correct one
2014-01-19 06:02:21	copumpkin	and then prove things about the simple obviously correct one
2014-01-19 06:02:31	copumpkin	now you can carry those proofs to the fancy algorithm automagically
2014-01-19 06:03:08	augur	well if thats the primary goal -- proving things -- then ETT and/or a funext postulate is sufficient to prove things
2014-01-19 06:03:50	augur	if the purpose is to transport _functionality_ thats a different issue (but iinm isomorphisms get you that anyway, but who knows)
2014-01-19 06:04:13	augur	but at least by the time of the HoTT class last fall, there was no computational interpretation for HITs
2014-01-19 06:07:00	augur	also copumpkin ive become convinced that CCCs arent the right category to use for IPL, they're just a special case coding of the right category
2014-01-19 06:07:17	augur	specifically, we should be using something like CCMs
2014-01-19 06:08:10	augur	im always unconvinced of something. heh

2014-01-19 06:49:16	Cale	augur: The thing which really sets it apart from classical mathematics is that it lets us prove theorems "at all levels", by which I mean it lets us realise that constructively valid proofs of things you might have thought were about propositions or sets are also true about groupoids and n-groupoids and topological spaces up to homotopy
2014-01-19 06:49:41	Cale	and groupoids provide a really natural place to start doing category theory
2014-01-19 06:49:51	augur	ok
2014-01-19 06:54:13	Cale	augur: It also provides a remarkably concise definition of infinity groupoids.

2014-01-19 06:55:36	Cale	augur: The path induction rule encodes within it all the information about operations and laws and coherences between those laws and coherences between the coherences, and so on for an infinity groupoid, which is *really* obnoxious to formalise in classical mathematics.
2014-01-19 06:56:22	Cale	and it does it in a way where we don't have to go nuts writing out this general stuff, we can just unpack the specific things as we need them
2014-01-19 06:57:00	Cale	There's also a good deal of hope it'll provide similarly nice definitions of higher categories
2014-01-19 06:57:57	Cale	augur: It's easy to define a sort of category in HoTT such that equivalences of categories become equalities of those categories.
2014-01-19 06:58:20	augur	ok
2014-01-19 06:58:25	augur	thats not convincing me of anything but ok
2014-01-19 06:58:26	augur	:P
2014-01-19 06:58:46	Cale	Well, that's a very pleasant thing for a category theorist :)
2014-01-19 06:58:54	augur	im sure!
2014-01-19 07:00:13	Cale	Basically anything where category theorists use language like "the X" with a generalised notion of "the" that applies up to some occasionally-complicated-to-define-equivalence will actually be justified by making those objects identical.
2014-01-19 07:00:49	Cale	As a simpler example, you can formulate a category of groups where any two groups which are isomorphic are identical
2014-01-19 07:01:19	augur	seriously cale, you dont need to explain this
2014-01-19 07:01:21	Cale	(the isomorphisms of those groups are subsumed into the paths)
2014-01-19 07:01:23	Cale	okay
2014-01-19 07:03:21	Cale	The primary reason that none of the classical mathematicians were actually using formal systems like ZFC directly was largely that we want to identify structures under various notions of sameness, and traditional set theory makes reasoning about that sameness unduly difficult.
2014-01-19 07:03:56	 *	augur bops Cale
2014-01-19 07:04:03	augur	cale bop
2014-01-19 07:04:03	augur	hah
2014-01-19 07:04:06	Cale	lol
2014-01-19 07:05:36	Cale	So we'd use high level language, and pay lip service to the notion that everything was formalisable in ZFC, and resolve disputes by perhaps occasionally going down to a lower level, but wouldn't really work there in a way which would make it reasonable for machines to check anything.

2014-01-19 07:12:06	Noldorin	can any folks here recommend some well-written, well-motivated introductory books on category theory please?
2014-01-19 07:12:34	Noldorin	especially with relations to logic and algebra. I don't care so much about the geometrical connections right now
2014-01-19 07:13:17	augur	Noldorin: well-motivated? ouch. um. maybe awodey's book?
2014-01-19 07:13:36	Noldorin	augur, oh gosh. that was very poorly motivated when I read the first chapter...
2014-01-19 07:13:41	augur	if you want a connection to (intuitionistic) logic, awodey + pfenning are good
2014-01-19 07:13:45	Noldorin	hm
2014-01-19 07:13:51	Noldorin	might try it again
2014-01-19 07:13:53	augur	but they dont work together
2014-01-19 07:13:58	Noldorin	augur, hadn't heard of Pfenning. thanks
2014-01-19 07:14:04	augur	hes a logician at CMU
2014-01-19 07:14:10	augur	he does a lot of type theory stuff
2014-01-19 07:14:22	augur	but there are nice connections between CT and TT
2014-01-19 07:14:36	Noldorin	augur, what do you think of a) Piece, b) Lawvere and Schanuel?
2014-01-19 07:14:48	augur	havent read any of them.
2014-01-19 07:14:50	Noldorin	yes indeed... the type theory connections interest me
2014-01-19 07:14:54	Noldorin	so sounds good
2014-01-19 07:15:01	augur	the TT connection is really clean and simple
2014-01-19 07:15:20	Noldorin	augur, does a proper job of the curry-howard isomorphism and all?
2014-01-19 07:15:24	augur	you just have to twist your head around to see how its all working, since its not perfectly tight
2014-01-19 07:15:44	Noldorin	heh okay
2014-01-19 07:15:51	augur	Noldorin: no no, curry-howard is between props and types -- both are syntactic obejcts. curry-howard-lambek is where you get CT
2014-01-19 07:16:24	Noldorin	augur, that's what I mean yeah
2014-01-19 07:16:41	augur	CT is at the semantic level so proofs/programs only come up as a special case
2014-01-19 07:16:45	Noldorin	augur, sometimes they're both called CH though, as I've seen it. things rarely get attributed to the right person of course...
2014-01-19 07:16:48	Noldorin	fair enough
2014-01-19 07:16:53	augur	yeah well people are often wrong :)
2014-01-19 07:17:23	Noldorin	augur, what's your background in CT out of curiosity? seen you discussing it on several occasions in ##math
2014-01-19 07:17:33	augur	tho tbh i think CH shouldnt be as split as people make it out to be. CH is not a correspondence, its not an isomorphism, it's an on-the-nose identity
2014-01-19 07:17:54	augur	Noldorin: im a linguist. no real background in CT other than amateur interest
2014-01-19 07:18:03	Noldorin	fair enough
2014-01-19 07:18:06	augur	i dont hang out in ##math tho, maybe youve seen me in other places :)
2014-01-19 07:18:31	Noldorin	augur, maybe ##logic then

2014-01-19 07:24:45	augur	well
2014-01-19 07:24:54	augur	you need to know the basics before you know the magic :)

2014-01-19 07:45:03	augur	but then who cares. i can do that already.
2014-01-19 07:45:20	Cale	It's much nicer than working with setoids though, in that your ambient system supports all that stuff

2014-01-19 07:45:41	augur	supports how
2014-01-19 07:45:52	augur	look, if you have to write proofs, you're not ambient support
2014-01-19 07:46:07	augur	all you're doing is writing the equations inside the scope of the List declaration
2014-01-19 07:46:13	augur	as opposed to in a postulate right after it
2014-01-19 07:46:33	augur	i can already write   postulate idl : forall {xs} -> [] ++ xs = xs
2014-01-19 07:46:48	Cale	well, sure
2014-01-19 07:46:55	augur	if i have to still do =-reasoning, then im not getting anything new
2014-01-19 07:47:25	Cale	Here's something perhaps that's a little trickier, suppose we want to define "commutative lists"
2014-01-19 07:47:46	augur	ok
2014-01-19 07:48:04	augur	postulate comm : forall {xs ys} -> xs ++ ys = ys ++ xs
2014-01-19 07:48:23	Cale	Well, no, you're not going to be able to prove that
2014-01-19 07:48:30	augur	i dont have to
2014-01-19 07:48:32	augur	its a postulate
2014-01-19 07:49:32	Cale	Can you do computations on those commutative lists?
2014-01-19 07:49:53	Cale	If you've put that in as an axiom, I would expect it to just be a stuck term
2014-01-19 07:50:02	augur	sure. not necessarily in ways that respect commutation of course.
2014-01-19 07:50:18	augur	well stuckness isnt something we avoid in HoTT either
2014-01-19 07:50:25	Cale	Well, okay
2014-01-19 07:50:55	augur	guarantees of respective HIT equalities is nice
2014-01-19 07:50:57	augur	ill grant that
2014-01-19 07:50:57	Cale	(Actually, in principle we can -- I found out today that there is a system which can compute and prove univalence in HoTT)
2014-01-19 07:51:06	Cale	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
2014-01-19 07:51:13	augur	but what would be much nicer is not having to fiddle with stupid equational reasoning
2014-01-19 07:51:16	augur	that is to say
2014-01-19 07:51:20	augur	if i have xs ++ ys
2014-01-19 07:51:28	augur	and i want to use it where i need ys ++ xs
2014-01-19 07:51:39	augur	i dont want to have to fiddle with proofs
2014-01-19 07:52:02	Cale	Well, you could write a decision procedure for that. I think it's way too ambitious to expect that everything of that sort is decidable
2014-01-19 07:52:06	augur	because the whole point of defining a CommutativeList type is _precisely_ that the inhabitants are commutative lists, not merely codes for commutative lists
2014-01-19 07:52:24	Cale	But yeah, if it's a constructor
2014-01-19 07:52:35	augur	ETT makes this not a problem ofcourse
2014-01-19 07:52:40	Cale	Then we can expect our proof assistants to perhaps find that proof for us and guess it
2014-01-19 07:52:44	augur	which is why i'd love to play around with extensional Agda
2014-01-19 07:53:15	Cale	augur: Of course, the whole point of HoTT is that it's *intensely* proof-relevant
2014-01-19 07:53:24	augur	proof relevance is not the same thing as intensional
2014-01-19 07:53:28	augur	ETT is proof relevant
2014-01-19 07:53:43	Cale	I mean the identity types are
2014-01-19 07:53:56	augur	meh.
2014-01-19 07:54:03	Cale	You can do truly interesting things with the identity types in HoTT
2014-01-19 07:54:06	augur	ETT+HITs sounds better than HoTT+HITs to me
2014-01-19 07:54:54	Cale	Basically, express symmetries of practically any sort you can imagine.
2014-01-19 07:55:10	Cale	and reason about those symmetries as objects in their own right
2014-01-19 07:55:10	augur	there's just something incredibly appealing to the idea of being able to define free algebras for equational theories, not just bare functors
2014-01-19 07:56:07	Cale	and not only do you get the equational theory, but you can talk about equational theories where the laws only hold up to some higher level equivalences
2014-01-19 07:56:17	augur	yeah i dont care about that
2014-01-19 07:56:22	augur	i want beautiful code
2014-01-19 07:56:43	augur	ETT + HITs would be the most beautiful code i've seen
2014-01-19 07:57:38	augur	and the most useful combination ive seen, i think. because then all sorts of things are just proven cheaply, using boring = proofs on the HIT's
2014-01-19 07:57:49	Cale	There's a way to simulate higher inductive types even if you don't have support for them, but they don't compute (or don't compute very nicely)
2014-01-19 07:58:12	augur	simulation isnt as good as having them
2014-01-19 07:58:33	Cale	Yeah, it depends on whether you're concerned with actually running your programs :)
2014-01-19 07:58:53	Cale	(and whether the programs involving them show up as type indices...)
2014-01-19 07:59:22	augur	i just want to be able to do stuff like define CommutativeList without having to prove crap
2014-01-19 07:59:50	augur	i mean, when you think about it, the reason we cant get CommutativeList for cheap is not something fundamental to logic, ok
2014-01-19 07:59:54	augur	or to computation, per se
2014-01-19 08:00:21	augur	CommutativeList is costly, while List is cheap, precisely because the physical world, and thus memory, is linearized
2014-01-19 08:00:23	Cale	Of course, adding those paths is going to change the induction principle
2014-01-19 08:00:39	augur	and thus its easy to inspect two lists for identity because order is inherent
2014-01-19 08:00:50	augur	but for commutative lists we need to somehow factor out order
2014-01-19 08:01:16	Cale	Well, yeah, defining a decidable equality for commutative lists would require extra structure on the underlying type
2014-01-19 08:01:27	augur	ultimately when we write things down on our sheets of paper
2014-01-19 08:01:29	Cale	(especially if you want it to be efficient)
2014-01-19 08:01:38	augur	to define equalities, they're presented in a linear order
2014-01-19 08:01:55	augur	the sequence of symbols    xs ++ ys   is different from   ys ++ xs

2014-01-19 08:02:49	augur	yeah yeah add it on to what i wrote earlier :)
2014-01-19 08:03:01	augur	this is to my mind a really bad reason to not have built in CommList
2014-01-19 08:03:20	augur	actually ideally i want to be able to define definitional equality, not Id equality. that'd be ideal
2014-01-19 08:03:50	augur	then you wouldnt need ETT at all
2014-01-19 08:04:03	augur	but unfortunately you'd also loose equality-by-normalization
2014-01-19 08:04:26	Cale	Well, are you thinking for a proof assistant, or something you'd use for programming?
2014-01-19 08:04:31	augur	both
2014-01-19 08:04:59	augur	either? is there a difference?
2014-01-19 08:05:18	Cale	Well, if you're concerned about consistency, it seems really unsafe to just let people throw in definitional equalities and risk breaking everything.
2014-01-19 08:05:48	augur	yeah but that would be a job for your type checker/logical framework
2014-01-19 08:05:58	augur	to ensure that your HITs dont make things inconsistent
2014-01-19 08:07:21	augur	here's another thing that makes this tricky:
2014-01-19 08:07:38	augur	if you have xs ++ ys = ys ++ xs as a defeq, you cant use injectivity in the usual way
2014-01-19 08:07:53	augur	for lists you have
2014-01-19 08:08:11	augur	x:xs = y:ys -> x = y * xs = ys
2014-01-19 08:08:12	Cale	I'm not quite so ambitious there, I'm okay with identity types being very proof-relevant, and primarily using identity types. I think if we can get the right general sorts of things proven, then we'll end up with something very usable. HoTT does a lot of those things as lemmas.
2014-01-19 08:08:21	augur	but if you have commutative lists then
2014-01-19 08:08:47	augur	xs ++ ys = zs ++ ws -> (xs = zs * ys = wa) + (xs = ws * ys = zs)
2014-01-19 08:08:56	augur	modulo associativity, as well
2014-01-19 08:10:03	augur	there really ought to be some research on mechanically derived representations of different properties like associativity and commutativity
2014-01-19 08:15:16	Cale	Oh, and if you want group-lists of type A in HoTT, you interestingly get to do something a little more clever, and just define a type with a single point, and then paths between that point and itself for each value of A.
2014-01-19 08:15:48	Cale	and then the identity type pt = pt becomes your "lists with associativity and inverses"
2014-01-19 08:16:08	Cale	If you want commutativity as well, you can stick that in
2014-01-19 08:17:02	Cale	But that lets you reuse all the basic stuff people have proven about paths
2014-01-19 08:17:47	Cale	(where by group lists, I mean the free group)

2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:20:35] arrows only map one object to another object
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:20:36] what?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:20:43] i didnt say * was an arrow
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:20:53] an arrow m : M*M -> M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:20:56] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:20:58] m is an arrow
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:21:02] that goes from M*M to M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:21:29] so in terms of category Set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:21:38] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:21:59] it goes from a cartesian product of set M and set M to the set M?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:22:04] so a monoid in |Set is an set M together with a function e : 1 -> M and a function m : MxM -> M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:22:35] where MxM is another set in Set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:22:39] right
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:22:48] the cartesian product MxM
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:22:55] so a monoid in a category requires at least 3 different objects?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:01] no no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:23:01] 1, M, and M*M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:05] it requires one object, M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:09] and two arrows
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:12] e and m
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:23:18] M*M is an object in C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:21] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:23:30] so it requires M and M*M, no?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:23:39] we get that for free because these are monoids _in monoidal categories_
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:24:03] What are the laws regarding e, m, and *?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:24:15] aren't monoidal categories subset of regular categories?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:24:17] e and m have to play nicely together in way way, don't they?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:24:22] dleedev: yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:24:23] dleedev: yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:24:37] so then they either have an object, or they don't
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:24:40] notdan: yes, they're just the usual monoid laws, but written in a categorical sense
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:24:46] M*M is an object in the category, or it is not
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:24:55] dleedev: right, but we dont have to "give" M*M and 1
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:25:07] well i can't seeem to get a grip for those laws. There is no way m and e can compose
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:25:13] augur_: but you have to assume their presence
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:25:16] dleedev: those are gotten for free because the category is monoidal, with 1 and *, so we know 1 and M*M exist already
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:25:19] so how should those laws be written down?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:25:30] notdan: in CT, preferably with diagrams :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:25:40] notdan: tho you can write some horrible equations if you want
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:26:05] does being a monoidal category require the category to have M*M?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:26:22] I thought M*M was an object in the product category, not the original category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:26:31] oh 1 is not necessary a terminal object; just a monoidal unit
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:26:40] notdan: something like m.<id,e> = e and m.<e,id> = e and m.<m,id> = m.<id,m>
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:26:49] dleedev: no, M*M is an object in the orignal category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:26:53] dleedev: well remember what monoidal categories are
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:27:15] dleedev: the definition says * has to take two objects in C to an object in C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:27:22] The functor * maps objects _from_ the product category _to_ the original category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:27:24] dleedev: thats a _precondition_
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:27:42] dleedev: so if we know that that's true, then if we know M is an object in C, so too must M*M be an object in C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:28:45] augur_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monoid_mult.png aha, so the monoid in a monoidal category is a kind of interpretation of the monoidal structure of C?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:28:56] I'm trying to reconcile what you're saying with the fact that M*M is an object in the product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:28:58] notdan: no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:29:07] dleedev: uh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:29:15] M*M is not an object in a product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:29:26] i mean it might be depending on what * is or whatever
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:29:33] notdan said "The functor * maps objects _from_ the product category _to_ the original category"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:29:33] but thats a tangential fact
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:29:39] yeah ignore notdan
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:30:05] Cale mentioned something similar too, about a product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	notdan	[16:30:06] ):
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:30:08] product categories are related to this and can make some of it cleaner to understand, but arent necessary
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:30:21] yeah Cale was telling you more than you needed to know :P
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:30:43] the thing that's confusing is "the definition says * has to take two objects in C to an object in C"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:30:44] its not false, what they said, but its an extra bunch of facts that dont help just yet
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:30:49] dleedev: yes.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:31:04] I don't know of anything that can take two objects to one object
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:10] dleedev: sure you do
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:12] *!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:31:19] but what is that in terms of CT?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:20] i mean, you know how to take one object to one object right
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:31:22] a functor, right?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:23] thats a functor
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:28] * is just a "bi"functor
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:31:40] a map from two categories to one?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:43] no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:31:48] i mean it could
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:31:52] functor maps a category to another
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:32:03] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:32:12] so what does a bifunctor do?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:32:15] in principle, a bifunctor could take two objects in _different_ categories
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:32:56] so to give a very precise explanation of a bifunctor does indeed require product categories
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:33:36] maybe we should go the precise route, because I'm getting confused
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:33:46] if you insist
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:33:56] given any two categories C and D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:34:07] we can form a new category written CxD as follows:
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:34:22] the objects of CxD are pairs of objects (X,Y) where X is in C and Y is in D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:34:46] much like set product
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:34:55] for any objects (X,Y) and (X',Y') in CxD
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:35:22] Hom((X,Y),(X',Y')) = { (f,g) : f in Hom(X,X') in C, and g : Hom(Y,Y') in D }
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:35:40] so, since objects in CxD are pairs of objects in C and D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:35:45] arrows are pairs of arrows
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:36:01] ok, that makes sense
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:36:04] identity is just the pair of identities, composition is pointwise
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:36:17] then in general a bifunctor is a functor from a product category.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:36:46] so a category C is monoidal if there is a bifunctor * : CxC -> C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:36:49] blah blah blah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:36:57] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:37:04] so then back to M*M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:09] so you see, M*M is a single object in C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:37:12] (Why do we need to call it bifunctor when it is just a functor A x B -> C ?)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:17] (M,M) is a single object in CxC
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:26] and we apply * to (M,M) to get back into C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:32] we can write that *(M,M) or just M*M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:37:50] OK, so (M,M) lives in the product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:51] mr-: to specify its from a product category?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:37:59] dleedev: right, (M,M) is in CxC
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:38:07] but *(M,M) or just M*M is in C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:38:23] you dont really need product categories for bifunctors tho
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:38:30] you could specify bifunctors like this:
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:39:28] a bifunctor F from C and D to E has an action on two objects Fob and an action on two arrows Far like so:
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:39:41] given X in C and Y in D, FXY is in E
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:40:09] given f : X -> X' in C and g : Y -> Y' in D, Ffg : FXY -> FX'Y' in E
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:40:14] such that blah blah blah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:40:52] the fact that you _can_ define this in terms of product categories and normal functors is nice
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:40:59] but isnt a priori a requirement for the notion of bifunctor
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:41:30] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:41:33] so you said this: so a monoid in |Set is an set M together with a function e : 1 -> M and a function m : MxM -> M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:41:36] its just a nice little "closure" property so that n-functors are just functors for some relevant category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:41:44] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:41:53] e and m are arrows?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:41:59] yes, in |Set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:42:07] so they're (total) functions
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:42:15] MxM basically is M, right?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:42:20] no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:42:26] MxM is M cross M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:42:32] the cartesian product of M with itself
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:42:34] at least in |Set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:43:15] let's not use |Set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:43:23] if you wish
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:43:32] |Set is nice tho because you can import intuitions from programming
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:43:48] tho haskell's notation for types is confusing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:43:52] does every monoidal category have a monoid?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:44:02] a monoid object?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:44:05] probably not.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:44:19] i would be surprised if they did
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:44:24] "monoid in a category" => "monoid object"?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:44:31] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:45:45] ok, well I guess I understand what you mean by: so a monoid in |Set is an set M together with a function e : 1 -> M and a function m : MxM -> M
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:45:58] where do we go from there?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:46:05] where do you want to go? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:48:11] it sounds like your aim is to understand the sentence "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:48:34] ah, yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:48:36] if thats your aim, i can try to take you there, or i can point you to catsters and outline the path you should take through the videos
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:48:40] but I have a few stepping stones
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:48:55] augur_: but it does not make sense to say that it is a bifunctor C x C -> C
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:49:03] one is... "a monoid in the category"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:49:05] mr-: ey?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:49:29] "monoid in category" means M?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:49:42] or <M, m, e>?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:49:47] ehhh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:49:59] thats a systematic ambiguity people use, dleedev
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:50:11] sometimes they mean M, and you know there are such m and e
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:50:21] but its more accurate to say its (M,m,e)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:51:13] augur_: just like bilinear means something different from linear, bifunctor should mean something different from functor :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:51:24] oh, what is 1, btw, in the definition of e?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:51:25] mr-: it does
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:51:37] dleedev: 1 is the 1 from the monoidality of the category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:52:05] augur_: how?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:52:05] dleedev: C is monoidal if there is an object 1 in C and bifunctor * from CxC to C such that ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:52:12] mr-: bifunctor \subset functor
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:52:33] so in terms of monoidality of the category, MxM lived in the product category, but for M to be a monoid, MxM must live in the original category as well?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:53:10] dleedev: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~devriese/ct/catsters/linear.php
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:53:14] er... (M,M) lived in the product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:53:17] dleedev: no no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:53:24] yes right (M,M) is in the product category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:53:28] MxM is just in the category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:54:11] can a monoid live in a non-monoidal category?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:54:17] dleedev: in that link, i would suggest this ordering: Natural Transformations, Monoid Objects, Monads Introduction
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:54:19] or is that impossible?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:54:20] i think that should be enough
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:54:37] dleedev: no, i think thats impossible, because you need to have 1 and * to define monoid object
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:54:39] how do you suggest catsters vs awodey?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:54:47] catsters
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:55:02] you could read through awodey too, i dont know. i prefer the catsters videos
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:55:08] augur_: every functor is a bifunctor when you cross with the empty category and every bifunctor is a functor by definition. Anyway.. it's just vocabulary that I am not happy with. That's my problem
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:55:11] awodey's videos arent as good in my opinion
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:55:20] mr-: you mean the unit category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:55:27] no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:55:36] I mean the initial object in Cat
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:55:48] mr-: i dont think you do
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:55:56] cause then Cx0 = 0
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:56:05] augur_: are the catsters video suitable for my level?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:56:07] Oh, that's right.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:56:18] dleedev: if you go in the order i suggest, i think they are.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:56:28] that's besides the point, though :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:56:35] mr-: yes, its true, you can find an iso or something
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:56:35] so I shouldn't watch the limits and colimits?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[16:56:40] (beside?)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:56:50] mr-: in the same way there "unary" and "binary" are related
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:56:56] dleedev: you dont have to
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:57:06] you can if you want! but its not relevant to the goal in question
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:57:56] if I wanted to watch everything, what order do you recommend?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:58:01] oh gosh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:58:10] i dont know :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:58:46] the problem is that there are a lot of conceptual dependencies that are implicit
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:59:10] so to properly understand monads, you want to know about functor categories and natural transformations and monoidal categories and ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:59:25] but what about the rest?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:59:26] to understand adjunctions you want to know about product categories and natural transformations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[16:59:30] where do they lie in the dependency resolution?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:59:37] the (co) limit stuff is in the right order
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[16:59:54] yoneda requires natural transformations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:00:03] Open any book on Cat-theory, its index will give you an order :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:00:27] yeah, awodey's book's index is a good ordering
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:00:42] well
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:00:45] not the index
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:00:47] rather, the ToC
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:01:00] the index will give you an order, but a bad one!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:01:23] I am sure there are worse ;->
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:01:32] worse than arbitrary?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:01:52] well, reverse dependency is probably worse
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:02:21] augur_: if you have very good memory, reverse dependency might not be too bad
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:02:32] yeah but then neither would random
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:02:32] like lazy value resolution
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:02:49] diff list
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:02:57] read through the whole book and only when you're done does any of it make sense
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:03:03] haha
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:05:05] i really think there's got to be some way to derive "obvious" laws
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:05:10] like, the functor laws should be obvious
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:05:46] and thus should be derivable
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:06:02] and i think i have an intuition about how obviousness works out, at least for simple cases
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:06:51] as in "preserve all structure"? It's not completely obvious, though. To what extent do you want them preserved? Strictly? Up to a 2 cell?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:07:02] what's homotopy?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:07:19] oh god
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:07:24] homotopy
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:07:25] yikes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:07:31] what's a topological space
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:07:41] those are way complicated, dleedev
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:07:42] maybe I should go back to school
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:08:05] dleedev: if you want to learn CT as it relates to computer science, ignore topology for the moment
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:08:13] mr-: i just want to derive commuting diagrams for cheap!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:09:20] im going to go get food
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:09:22] brb
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:09:27] augur_: Oh, if you formulate it in type theory, I guess you can make the "commuting up to what" implicit by choosing a model
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:09:30] i hope the catsters videos don't refer to topology after this initial video
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:09:35] augur_: yum
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:09:44] dleedev: which initial video
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:09:51] natural transformations 1
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:09:55] oh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:09:59] thats just an example case
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:10:04] the order you suggested
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:10:07] you dont need to know homotopies to get natural transformations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:10:22] dleedev: seeing natural transformations as homotopies is a nice pointer for mathematicians, but you don't need to know that
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:10:24] the best intuition for natural transformations coming from programming is polymorphic functions
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:10:51] roughly speaking, a haskell function   f :: forall a. f a -> g a
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:10:54] is a natural transformation
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:11:04] who're the catsters btw?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:11:06] professors?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:11:09] yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:11:18] eugenia cheng and simon willerton
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:11:19] (ok afk)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:11:31] augur_: is it obvious that those are nat trans.?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:11:46] mr-: well, sorry, if f and g are functors :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:11:57] sure, but even then
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:12:05] and then its almost obvious, but its also not strictly true
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:12:12] its just an intuition
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:12:14] AFK :|
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[17:12:17] haha
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:12:42] almost obvious and not strictly true..
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:33:18] mr-: :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:33:29] best kind of metaphor!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:34:03] or maybe, example
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:36:04] relational monoids are horrible :(
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[17:38:31] augur_: One of my professors once said "The following theorem is immensly useful and, sadly, wrong"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:42:31] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:43:20] lots of wrong theorems are immensely useful
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[17:43:44] especially since their wrongth means assuming them lets you prove anything!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:04:23] its interesting that in some cases, even the definition of arrows in a category are determined by the choice of objects
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:04:39] to the point where obviousness can derive a lot of things
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[18:05:38] Do you have an example?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:05:54] well, product categories, slice categories, etc
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:06:04] the arrows are almost forced given the choice of objects
2014-01-22 21:50:28	mr-	[18:06:06] I guess you are looking for some kind of "theorem for free" in that context?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:06:21] eh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:06:35] i just want a nice mechanical definition of obviousness :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:07:02] so that if i say the objects of C/X are pairs (A,f) where A in C, and f : A -> X
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:07:19] then the arrows should be generable by some nice little set of principles
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:07:52] all we have around is C, all we can do is plug arrows into diagrams, etc.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:26:03] ok well, im headed to bed
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[18:26:07] night mr-, dleedev
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[18:28:04] augur_: good night
2014-01-22 21:50:28	dleedev	[18:28:08] thanks for everything!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:26:26] o/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:26:35] 'lo
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:26:43] wait carter you're @cartazio?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:26:43] :|
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:26:46] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:26:54] augur_: its in my twitter hame
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:27:08] why :|
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:27:13] well thats just silly, how did you not know about this place
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:27:16] you're in #haskell plenty
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:27:18] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:27:25] but its SOO high volume i can't read it :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:27:35] fair enough
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:27:41] are you psygnive?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:27:44] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:27:49] i guess we have chatted before!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:27:59] :p
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:28:05] if you clickec on my twitter handle
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:28:08] you'd see my name
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:28:25] yeah but that doesnt mean your irc name was carter
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:28:33] lies
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:28:38] i know a kristof micinski on twitter, but kristof in #haskell isnt him
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:28:44] @carter is taken on github and twitter
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lambdabot	[08:28:44] My impatience is running out.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:28:49] 'cause people are assholes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:29:09] i try to grab @carter when its available
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:29:13] @cartazio is the fallback
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lambdabot	[08:29:13] Unknown command, try @list
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:29:14] there's also ##typetheory btw
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:29:23] augur_: i've enough chanels
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:29:28] never enough!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:29:30] nope
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:29:31] enough
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:30:18] im in 26 channels on freenode
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:31:52] tac: the catsters video about 2 categories is the start of an intro to higher categories tho
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:32:04] i think she generalizes a little bit towards the end maybe?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tac	[08:32:19] hm
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur_	[08:32:44] as she says in her book tho, there are different ways of generalizing to higher dimensions, so ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tac	[08:33:13] yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tac	[08:33:37] I think this is neat. I can kinda see what those string diagrams are supposed to mean
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:34:36] edsko's thing there is the best way to navigate catsters, btw
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:34:49] it doesnt include the new vids on ends, but
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:43:30] its very interesting that a 2cat is a cat with hom enriched to be a cat not a set
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:43:44] whereas an enriched category has ob enriched
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:45:07] It does?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:46:01] Cale: yeah, a 2cat is a cat where Hom(X,Y) is a category, id is a functor 1 => Hom(X,X), and . is a bifunctor Hom(Y,Z) x Hom(X,Y) => Hom(X,Z)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:46:06] A strict 2-cat is a category enriched over (Cat, x, 1)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:46:55] that might also be true, but at least in the catsters presentation "enriched over" means Ob becomes a category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:47:04] orly
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:47:05] whereas for this we're enriching Hom
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:48:10] Where's the video where they do those enriched cats?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:48:33] maybe im mis-remembering
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:48:55] Oh, a Catster on ends! :o
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:48:59] yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:49:07] Usually you're enriching the Homs, replacing them with objects in another monoidal category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:49:08] unfortunately its simon, who isnt as good as eugenia :\
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:49:32] I still haven't wrapped my head around ends and kan extensions
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:49:59] Judging from what I have understood I wish I'd known of them earlier though :/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:50:03] Cale: it seems im almost certainly misremembering, since wikipedia agrees on the definition of an enriched category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:51:07] augur: I know in the ones where Simon describes metric spaces as a kind of enriched category, he's replacing the homs with real numbers (distances)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:51:19] hmm hmm
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:51:26] noteventime: The ones on ends are very new
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:51:40] well im going to rewatch those
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:51:45] as soon as im done watching the 2cat ones
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:51:48] Or you just mean ends and kan extensions in general?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:51:54] I didn't even know they made new ones
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:52:12] Cale: I mean in general
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:52:42] I think a few things I did in my bachelor's project might have been easier to understand in terms of ends
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:52:55] That's interesting :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:53:13] At least, I remember fiddling with dinatural transformations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:53:58] i really enjoy eugenia's presentation of CT :\
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:53:59] Without realising that's what they were called (had to ask on stackexchange)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:54:15] does anyone know where i can read up about F_un wrt category theory?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:54:21] (an accessible exposition?)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[08:54:25] whats F_un
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:54:30] the field with one element
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:54:43] its kinda a funny algebraic geometry fake thign thats real
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:55:13] ceci n'est pas un corps
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:55:22] http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4191 http://cage.ugent.be/~kthas/Fun/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:55:47] je ne parles vois frances
2014-01-22 21:50:28	carter	[08:55:59] i think
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[08:56:16] Hmm, do functors C x C^op -> D appear a lot if you don't count (enriched) Hom-functors?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:58:41] Well, most of them are obtained by fiddling with Hom functors in some fashion
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:58:46] at least that I've seen
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[08:59:11] i.e. by composing in other functors
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[09:00:50] Actually I guess dependent products might quality, if you can make them functorial in the contravariant argument
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[09:01:40] (dependent product means right adjoint to pullback functor between comma categories here :P)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:01:47] hey Cale, do you know of any general approach to fillers+contexts/holes/etc.?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:02:24] You mean in that opetope stuff?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:02:33] no just in general
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:03:04] I'm not sure what the question means, so I guess no :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:03:08] like, zippers should be a special instance of this
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:03:22] or you could imagine like a puzzle with some pieces missing as a special kind of context
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:03:34] or a string with a subsequence removed is a context, etc etc
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[09:04:01] augur: Are you familiar with the notion of derivatives of data types?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:04:08] noteventime: yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:04:19] tho im not sure thats entirely the right analogy here
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:04:31] I guess when you ever have something which looks algebraically like a derivative, you get something like this
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:04:36] for one thing, im imagining n-hole contexts
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[09:04:52] Ok, because I think that's how zippers arise for general algebraic types
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:04:55] and im also imagining that like, if you take an n-dimensional space and delete portions, thats also a plausible context
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:05:05] Oh, well
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:05:21] Okay, you can form a multicategory?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:05:22] like, if you take a sheet of paper and cut out a donut shape, you have a one-hole context where the hole is donut shaped and has an island in the middle
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:05:24] etc etc
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:05:47] i actually ask specifically because of the interesting topology of higher dimensional versions
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:06:09] since in two dimensions, there are many ways to have one "hole" cut out of an object, depending on its topology
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:06:36] Or perhaps an operad is what you're looking for
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:06:47] yeah operads look potentially relevant
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:07:02] but im not sure that they have anything to say about the topological stuff (if theres anything to say at all)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:09:07] the topology of the 2d case makes it such that you dont want to just think of contexts as having n-holes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:09:29] since you probably dont want to fill a donut-shaped hole with a sphere shaped filler
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:09:51] that requires some self-gluing on the sphere, rather than just gluing the filler to the context
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:14:37] Yeah, you could define a multicategory whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms A_1, A_2, ..., A_n -> B consist of injective maps A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n -> B, which we picture as B with holes of those shapes.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:15:27] interesting
2014-01-22 21:50:28	noteventime	[09:15:42] "An end is a universal wedge" <- It's sentences like this that make mathematics worth studying X-D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:16:55] Cale: i feel like that doesnt _quite_ capture it but almost
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:17:06] Well, it depends on exactly what you want to capture
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:17:12] i dont know! :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:17:21] There are lots of variations on that kind of idea
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:17:58] http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0305049v1.pdf -- if you look in here, you'll find all kinds of remarkably silly-looking diagrams
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:18:00] basically, i have a version of this on strings, combined with predicates on the strings, and it has all sorts of cute properties and constructions
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:18:18] remarkably silly-looking diagrams are what make math fun!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:18:23] Including one for the "swiss cheese multicategory"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:18:50] oh wow i had that open yesterday while looking for an explanation of operads. :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:19:24] In the Acknowledgements, he has: "Paul-André Melliès gave me important information on Swiss cheese."
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:19:33] hahahahaha
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:20:46] also see the "little d-disks operad"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:20:55] yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:23:49] operads are ofcourse single-object multicats
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:23:50] But yeah, much of higher category theory consists of considerations like "What if we were pasting together diagrams shaped like THIS? <insane doodle>"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:24:25] and then everyone takes it all very seriously and conclusions are drawn
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:27:07] Cale: i guess for the topological version as im thinking of it, instead of A_i being a topological space, it should rather be like.. a characteristic number of the space, or something like that
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:27:09] Especially the sorts of "diagrams" you see when people talk about topological quantum field theories, where your average "arrows" consist of things which look like pairs of pants (albeit quite frequently for aliens having unusual body topology)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:28:07] because we want to imagine that substitution just glues spaces together into larger spaces, rather than mapping over the spaces
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:28:28] string diagrams, you mean. :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:28:29] i just read some blog posts and got my first suspicion of possibly understanding a bit of the yoneda lemma. something about it reminds me of the notion of currying -- at least in the sense of both involving isomorphisms between some fairly abstract things. but i wonder if there's a more precise relation than that?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:28:32] string worldline diagrams
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:28:33] Are you familiar with the infinity category of cobordisms?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:28:42] no but thats ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:29:01] tpsinnem: yoneda is actually about continuations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:29:07] if you programmatize it
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:29:22] Or infinity groupoid, I suppose
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:29:31] tpsinnem: in haskell, yoneda is really simple
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:29:47] augur: Basically, given two n-manifolds with boundary, the arrows between them are n+1 dimensional manifolds connecting one to the other
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:30:09] (or not connecting, they just fill the space in between somehow)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:30:15] tpsinnem:   fwd :: forall a f. Functor f => f a -> (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)   ;   fwd x = \f -> fmap f x
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:30:38] tpsinnem:    bwd :: forall a f. Functor f => (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r) -> f a   ;   bwd f = f id
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:31:06] Cale: ya
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:31:06] augur: it was in fact through a haskell post that i sort of started thinking i understand something
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:31:12] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:31:17] was it sigfpe's?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:31:32] hm, let be dig that back up
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:31:39] his is really good
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:31:42] tpsinnem: Have you read Awodey's presentation of the Yoneda lemma and surrounding material?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:32:33] http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/gadts.html
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:32:43] I didn't fully get the Yoneda lemma until I read his stuff on it.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:33:23] In particular, the very important bit is that it acts as a sort of completion theorem for categories
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:33:24] Cale: i don't remember what precisely i had read earlier -- it's been a while and back then i didn't really get anywhere
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:33:41] tpsinnem: http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/11/yoneda-lemma.html
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:33:47] i will want to read different perspectives now that i seem to have gotten a bit of a grip on this
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:34:18] but in general actually i think i'll soon want to go through some basic CT texts with a bit more discipline than before
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:35:10] You can take any possibly badly behaved category, and embed it as a full subcategory of one which has all small limits and colimits, and has exponentials, and is a topos, and well, you have everything you could possibly want. You could interpret Coq in that category.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:35:22] augur: yeah looks good
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:35:51] Cale: i still dont like that interpretation of ITT :\
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:35:54] and if you can show that there's an arrow between two objects of your original category using all the machinery there, then it must have already been there in the original cat
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:36:00] i much prefer the multicategory interpretation
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:37:16] i should go get food and then program
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[09:37:20] i have a revolution to start!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tpsinnem	[09:37:21] anyhow, thanks for replies, as always :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:37:45] tpsinnem: So, it's kind of like how we use the complex numbers to prove things about the real numbers
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[09:38:15] (Or we can use real numbers to prove things about rational ones)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[11:58:01] oh Cale
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[11:58:21] do you know of any ways of defining "obviousness" so that you can mechanically derive various obvious things in CT?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[11:59:28] augur: I strongly suspect there is a way, but I don't know what it is :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[11:59:55] i was watching some catsters the other day and i thought that the definition of C/X looked like it ought to be derivable
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:00:33] Well, okay, also, if there's a way, then there's a way which just continues forever
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:00:43] sort of :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:00:44] ?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:00:56] You have to decide when you're going to stop and make things equations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:01:08] i suppose
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:02:42] Though I guess that's forced on you in many cases
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:03:22] Well, you could always decide that no, you were going to put in isomorphisms, but then maybe you want coherences between those and so on.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:03:34] 0.0
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:06:43] like what happens in the definition of a monoidal category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:06:56] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:07:29] This is a lot simpler if you insist that λ, ρ and α are all the identity, and you have equations
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:07:35] but then you lose most of your examples
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:08:09] and the coherence conditions are there to ensure that those isomorphisms have to work together somehow
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:10:49] but of course, you could get really silly and demand some kind of isomorphisms as additional fillers for the coherence conditions (but it's already pretty tiring by this point)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:11:07] If you had higher dimensional cells in your category, they would go in there though
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:14:21] (and you'd have higher dimensional pasting diagrams which would specify that those 2-cells for the pentagon diagram and triangle had to interact nicely somehow)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:16:57] hm
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:19:32] I'm sure you could write down in specific sorts of setups exactly what the laws were supposed to be though
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:20:10] Like, let's just say constructions involving a plain category, some endofunctors, and some natural transformations between words on those endofunctors
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:21:12] You want all the different ways of using the natural transformations to go between the same words to be equal.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:22:27] i guess
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[12:22:33] it'd be interesting to see how to do that tho
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:28:28] actually, haha, I wonder if it's undecidable in general
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:28:38] Like, if it's equivalent to some word problem
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cale	[12:32:30] (i.e. with the right mix of functors and natural transformations between words on them, it might be undecidable whether there's a way to reach the empty word from an arbitrary one)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[14:21:03] whats a good book to follow up Awodey's with?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	copumpkin	[14:24:52] TTT
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[14:37:39] copumpkin: TTT is so dense :(
2014-01-22 21:50:28	copumpkin	[14:37:54] how do you think I got so dense?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[14:38:00] lolol
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[14:38:07] its also aimed towards people with a more mathematical background
2014-01-22 21:50:28	tac	[14:40:13] So just become a mathematician like the rest of #haskell-blah, augur
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[14:40:18] :P
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:41:46] ahh man
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:41:57] the proof that the yoneda embedding is indeed an embedding is so beautiful
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:42:18] once you have the yoneda lemma, its literally just.. there
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:44:28] yoneda-lemma : forall C F. Hom(yC,F) ~ FC   suppose C, D. yoneda-lemma(C,yD) : Hom(yC,yD) ~ yDC == Hom(yC,yD) ~ Hom(C,D)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:44:43] and thats your proof of embedding.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:45:01] its literally just instantiation of the lemma at C = C, F = yD
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:45:13] mind blowingly great
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:56:00] i mean its not like i didnt know this already, but its like a beautiful piece of music, you know?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[16:56:19] when you see it again after a while, you cant help but appreciate its beauty
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[18:14:59] hmm hmm
2014-01-22 21:50:28	augur	[18:15:44] i wish there was a nice little catalog of categorical constructions like various kinds of (co)limits etc using progressively more complex ideas

2014-01-26 10:12:43	noteventime	[09:04:01] augur: Are you familiar with the notion of derivatives of data types?
2014-01-26 10:12:43	augur	[09:04:08] noteventime: yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:43	augur	[09:04:19] tho im not sure thats entirely the right analogy here
2014-01-26 10:12:43	Cale	[09:04:31] I guess when you ever have something which looks algebraically like a derivative, you get something like this
2014-01-26 10:12:43	augur	[09:04:36] for one thing, im imagining n-hole contexts
2014-01-26 10:12:43	noteventime	[09:04:52] Ok, because I think that's how zippers arise for general algebraic types
2014-01-26 10:12:43	augur	[09:04:55] and im also imagining that like, if you take an n-dimensional space and delete portions, thats also a plausible context
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:05:05] Oh, well
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:05:21] Okay, you can form a multicategory?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:05:22] like, if you take a sheet of paper and cut out a donut shape, you have a one-hole context where the hole is donut shaped and has an island in the middle
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:05:24] etc etc
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:05:47] i actually ask specifically because of the interesting topology of higher dimensional versions
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:06:09] since in two dimensions, there are many ways to have one "hole" cut out of an object, depending on its topology
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:06:36] Or perhaps an operad is what you're looking for
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:06:47] yeah operads look potentially relevant
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:07:02] but im not sure that they have anything to say about the topological stuff (if theres anything to say at all)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:09:07] the topology of the 2d case makes it such that you dont want to just think of contexts as having n-holes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:09:29] since you probably dont want to fill a donut-shaped hole with a sphere shaped filler
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:09:51] that requires some self-gluing on the sphere, rather than just gluing the filler to the context
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:14:37] Yeah, you could define a multicategory whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms A_1, A_2, ..., A_n -> B consist of injective maps A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n -> B, which we picture as B with holes of those shapes.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:15:27] interesting
2014-01-26 10:12:44	noteventime	[09:15:42] "An end is a universal wedge" <- It's sentences like this that make mathematics worth studying X-D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:16:55] Cale: i feel like that doesnt _quite_ capture it but almost
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:17:06] Well, it depends on exactly what you want to capture
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:17:12] i dont know! :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:17:21] There are lots of variations on that kind of idea
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:17:58] http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0305049v1.pdf -- if you look in here, you'll find all kinds of remarkably silly-looking diagrams
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:18:00] basically, i have a version of this on strings, combined with predicates on the strings, and it has all sorts of cute properties and constructions
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:18:18] remarkably silly-looking diagrams are what make math fun!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:18:23] Including one for the "swiss cheese multicategory"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:18:50] oh wow i had that open yesterday while looking for an explanation of operads. :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:19:24] In the Acknowledgements, he has: "Paul-André Melliès gave me important information on Swiss cheese."
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:19:33] hahahahaha
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:20:46] also see the "little d-disks operad"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:20:55] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:23:49] operads are ofcourse single-object multicats
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:23:50] But yeah, much of higher category theory consists of considerations like "What if we were pasting together diagrams shaped like THIS? <insane doodle>"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:24:25] and then everyone takes it all very seriously and conclusions are drawn
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:27:07] Cale: i guess for the topological version as im thinking of it, instead of A_i being a topological space, it should rather be like.. a characteristic number of the space, or something like that
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:27:09] Especially the sorts of "diagrams" you see when people talk about topological quantum field theories, where your average "arrows" consist of things which look like pairs of pants (albeit quite frequently for aliens having unusual body topology)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:28:07] because we want to imagine that substitution just glues spaces together into larger spaces, rather than mapping over the spaces
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:28:28] string diagrams, you mean. :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:28:29] i just read some blog posts and got my first suspicion of possibly understanding a bit of the yoneda lemma. something about it reminds me of the notion of currying -- at least in the sense of both involving isomorphisms between some fairly abstract things. but i wonder if there's a more precise relation than that?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:28:32] string worldline diagrams
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:28:33] Are you familiar with the infinity category of cobordisms?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:28:42] no but thats ok
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:29:01] tpsinnem: yoneda is actually about continuations
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:29:07] if you programmatize it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:29:22] Or infinity groupoid, I suppose
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:29:31] tpsinnem: in haskell, yoneda is really simple
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:29:47] augur: Basically, given two n-manifolds with boundary, the arrows between them are n+1 dimensional manifolds connecting one to the other
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:30:09] (or not connecting, they just fill the space in between somehow)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:30:15] tpsinnem:   fwd :: forall a f. Functor f => f a -> (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)   ;   fwd x = \f -> fmap f x
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:30:38] tpsinnem:    bwd :: forall a f. Functor f => (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r) -> f a   ;   bwd f = f id
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:31:06] Cale: ya
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:31:06] augur: it was in fact through a haskell post that i sort of started thinking i understand something
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:31:12] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:31:17] was it sigfpe's?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:31:32] hm, let be dig that back up
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:31:39] his is really good
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:31:42] tpsinnem: Have you read Awodey's presentation of the Yoneda lemma and surrounding material?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:32:33] http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/gadts.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:32:43] I didn't fully get the Yoneda lemma until I read his stuff on it.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:33:23] In particular, the very important bit is that it acts as a sort of completion theorem for categories
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:33:24] Cale: i don't remember what precisely i had read earlier -- it's been a while and back then i didn't really get anywhere
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:33:41] tpsinnem: http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/11/yoneda-lemma.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:33:47] i will want to read different perspectives now that i seem to have gotten a bit of a grip on this
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:34:18] but in general actually i think i'll soon want to go through some basic CT texts with a bit more discipline than before
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:35:10] You can take any possibly badly behaved category, and embed it as a full subcategory of one which has all small limits and colimits, and has exponentials, and is a topos, and well, you have everything you could possibly want. You could interpret Coq in that category.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:35:22] augur: yeah looks good
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:35:51] Cale: i still dont like that interpretation of ITT :\
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:35:54] and if you can show that there's an arrow between two objects of your original category using all the machinery there, then it must have already been there in the original cat
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:36:00] i much prefer the multicategory interpretation
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:37:16] i should go get food and then program
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[09:37:20] i have a revolution to start!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tpsinnem	[09:37:21] anyhow, thanks for replies, as always :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:37:45] tpsinnem: So, it's kind of like how we use the complex numbers to prove things about the real numbers
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:38:15] (Or we can use real numbers to prove things about rational ones)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[11:58:01] oh Cale
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[11:58:21] do you know of any ways of defining "obviousness" so that you can mechanically derive various obvious things in CT?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:59:28] augur: I strongly suspect there is a way, but I don't know what it is :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[11:59:55] i was watching some catsters the other day and i thought that the definition of C/X looked like it ought to be derivable
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:00:33] Well, okay, also, if there's a way, then there's a way which just continues forever
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:00:43] sort of :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:00:44] ?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:00:56] You have to decide when you're going to stop and make things equations
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:01:08] i suppose
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:02:42] Though I guess that's forced on you in many cases
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:03:22] Well, you could always decide that no, you were going to put in isomorphisms, but then maybe you want coherences between those and so on.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:03:34] 0.0
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:06:43] like what happens in the definition of a monoidal category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:06:56] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:07:29] This is a lot simpler if you insist that λ, ρ and α are all the identity, and you have equations
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:07:35] but then you lose most of your examples
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:08:09] and the coherence conditions are there to ensure that those isomorphisms have to work together somehow
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:10:49] but of course, you could get really silly and demand some kind of isomorphisms as additional fillers for the coherence conditions (but it's already pretty tiring by this point)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:11:07] If you had higher dimensional cells in your category, they would go in there though
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:14:21] (and you'd have higher dimensional pasting diagrams which would specify that those 2-cells for the pentagon diagram and triangle had to interact nicely somehow)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:16:57] hm
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:19:32] I'm sure you could write down in specific sorts of setups exactly what the laws were supposed to be though
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:20:10] Like, let's just say constructions involving a plain category, some endofunctors, and some natural transformations between words on those endofunctors
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:21:12] You want all the different ways of using the natural transformations to go between the same words to be equal.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:22:27] i guess
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[12:22:33] it'd be interesting to see how to do that tho
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:28:28] actually, haha, I wonder if it's undecidable in general
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:28:38] Like, if it's equivalent to some word problem
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:32:30] (i.e. with the right mix of functors and natural transformations between words on them, it might be undecidable whether there's a way to reach the empty word from an arbitrary one)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[14:21:03] whats a good book to follow up Awodey's with?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	copumpkin	[14:24:52] TTT
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[14:37:39] copumpkin: TTT is so dense :(
2014-01-26 10:12:44	copumpkin	[14:37:54] how do you think I got so dense?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[14:38:00] lolol
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[14:38:07] its also aimed towards people with a more mathematical background
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[14:40:13] So just become a mathematician like the rest of #haskell-blah, augur
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[14:40:18] :P
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:41:46] ahh man
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:41:57] the proof that the yoneda embedding is indeed an embedding is so beautiful
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:42:18] once you have the yoneda lemma, its literally just.. there
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:44:28] yoneda-lemma : forall C F. Hom(yC,F) ~ FC   suppose C, D. yoneda-lemma(C,yD) : Hom(yC,yD) ~ yDC == Hom(yC,yD) ~ Hom(C,D)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:44:43] and thats your proof of embedding.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:45:01] its literally just instantiation of the lemma at C = C, F = yD
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:45:13] mind blowingly great
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:56:00] i mean its not like i didnt know this already, but its like a beautiful piece of music, you know?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[16:56:19] when you see it again after a while, you cant help but appreciate its beauty
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[18:14:59] hmm hmm
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur	[18:15:44] i wish there was a nice little catalog of categorical constructions like various kinds of (co)limits etc using progressively more complex ideas
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:17:28] is it easy to show that the free (weak omega) groupoid generated by id_A is the same as Hom_A? (with A a (weak omega) groupoid as well)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:18:43] or is it true at all? it seems implied by how people are fine with the inductive definition of identity types
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[22:21:05] What do you mean by "generated by id_A"?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:22:57] oh, right, that doesn't make much sense
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:23:26] i guess i want id_x for each x in Obj(A)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:24:26] but the fact that it's an indexed type might make this less sensical than i'm imagining
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:28:24] my point is that if the circle is the free groupoid generated by a 0-cell "base" and a 1-cell "loop : base -> base" then the inductive definition of Id_A should have a similar reading which i'm trying to figure out
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Saizan	[22:29:33] and the right one should be something equivalent to Hom_A
2014-01-26 10:12:44	RichyB	[21:22:17] help help I tried reading "Conceptual Mathematics" and now i don't understand maths without arrows in it D:
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mr-	[21:24:43] RichyB: translate it to math with arrows!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	RichyB	[21:25:48] Hee. ☺ It's impressive how well the category-theory-mafia is doing on wikipedia at adding (brief!) categorical descriptions to articles about other areas of mathematics. ☺
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ski	[00:07:38] RichyB : i believe "category terrorists" is the preferred terminology
2014-01-26 10:12:44	RichyB	[00:27:38] ski, I love it! :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:52:15] RichyB is british
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:52:32] or so the s in "maths" predicts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:52:39] mr- is not british
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ion	[08:46:38] Britishe mathes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:37:42] okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:38:25] So, let's see some examples
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:38:59] mjrosenb: I don't know what your mathematical background is like, but every branch of mathematics has at least one, if not many rich examples to offer
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:40:05] The idea being that every branch of mathematics is interested in studying some class of objects along with structure-preserving mappings of some sort between those objects, and generally those mappings can be composed in an associative fashion
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:40:06] Cale: pretty sure I took something from every sub-field of math that was offered while I was an undergrad.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:40:17] ah, cool, okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:40:34] So, you have a category of vector spaces and linear transformations between them
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:40:43] and a category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:40:55] and a category of topological spaces and continuous maps
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:41:11] a category of graphs and graph homomorphisms (of various sorts)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:41:18] a category of metric spaces and contraction mappings
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:42:40] Every monoid provides an example of a category in the way I mentioned already: you can build a category with a single object, and take the arrows from that object to itself to be the elements of the monoid, and the composition of arrows to be the monoid multiplication.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:42:58] ahh, topology, there was a conflict when that was offered :-(
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:43:15] anyhow, linear algebra was fun, how about an example from that?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:43:40] Yeah, so given any field F, there's a category whose objects are vector spaces over F
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:44:21] and whose arrows are linear transformations between the vector spaces
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:44:40] Composing linear transformations gives us a linear transformation
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:44:51] (i.e. composing them as functions)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:45:20] and linear transforms are associative.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:45:21] and for every vector space there is an identity linear transformation
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:45:25] and yeah, composition is associative
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:45:36] and so that defines a category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:45:51] As a weirder example
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:46:09] Let S be any set, and let <= be any reflexive, transitive relation on S
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:46:23] mjrosenb: I mentioned that one in #haskell too: The category Mat(F) is the category of matrices over some field F :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:46:33] i.e. for all x in S, we have x <= x, and for any x, y, z in S, whenever x <= y and y <= z, we have x <= z
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:46:43] Then we can make a category whose objects are the elements of S
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:46:57] and where there is exactly one arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:47:00] and no arrow otherwise
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:47:23] (btw, such a relation is called a preorder)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:47:33] This is a poset category iinm
2014-01-26 10:12:44	copumpkin	[09:47:40] Cale: like what I do on amazon, right?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:47:47] Cale: so in the first example, the number of elements in the vector is fixed, and the number of objects in the category is dependent on the number of elements in F?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:47:52] Which has a lot of objects and relatively few arrows
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:47:52] Well, it's a poset category if the preorder happens to be a poset
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:48:13] Compared to a monoid or group, which has a lot of arrows and relatively few objects (in fact, only one).
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:48:23] mjrosenb: The objects in the category of vector spaces are themselves entire vector spaces
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:48:25] Cale: righto
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:48:36] For example, if we pick F to be the real numbers
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:48:44] Cale: oh um... oh.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:48:46] Then R^n for each n will be an object of the category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:48:59] As will the space of continuous maps R -> R
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:49:15] and all sorts of weirder examples of vector spaces over the reals
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:50:13] (each of these sets coming equipped with the operations which make it a vector space of course)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:50:28] Cale: so the linear transforms would be arrows from R^2 to R^2, but is there anything between two distinct objects in the category?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:50:38] Cale: continuous maps R->R is a fun one.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:50:56] mjrosenb: There are plenty of linear maps R^n -> R^m in general
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:51:03] the proof that it is the same size as R was one of the ugliest proofs I ever wrote.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:51:31] (they correspond to n-by-m matrices, remember)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:51:52] mjrosenb: why? :P |RxR| = |R| trivially :p
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:52:13] ReinH: The set of all functions R -> R has greater cardinality than R
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:52:25] Cale: oh, linear maps, not linear transforms.  (I took linear algebra in 2005, I may be a bit of on the terminology, still remember the concepts though.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:52:28] (it has cardinality 2^|R|)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:52:43] mjrosenb: nono, linear transformations are the same thing :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:53:17] Remember if V and W are vector spaces over F, then a linear transformation (or linear map)  T: V -> W is a function such that
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[09:53:20] Cale: hrmm, what is the thing that is represented by foo a vec = [a*x | x <- vec]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:53:42] for any u,v in V, we have T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:53:55] Cale: right, which is P(R)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:53:56] and for any a in F and v in V, we have T(a*v) = a*T(v)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:54:21] er, which is equal to |P(R)|
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:54:49] ReinH: So, the hard part is showing that if you restrict to just the continuous ones, then the cardinality is the same as that of the reals.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:54:51] Cale: but I said RxR, not R^R :p Maybe I misunderstood what mjrosenb was saying.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:55:01] Cale: ah.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:55:13] ReinH: I don't know what R x R has to do with it, but maybe you have some idea for the proof :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:01] mjrosenb: Our vectors here are just abstract things which have an addition and scalar multiplication defined on them, so they needn't actually be tuples of real numbers
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:56:16] Cale: uh, the cardinality is at least |R| because of const
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:18] (but in some cases of course they will be)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:32] ReinH: right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:56:41] Cale: and at most |R| because the set of real continuous functions injects into R^2
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:49] how?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:57:08] (it does, but that's not exactly *simple* :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	mjrosenb [09:57:16] is curious about that injection as well.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:57:40] Sorry, R^N
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:58:11] R^N could work
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	mjrosenb [09:58:31] is not convinced  R^N is easy.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:58:35] Cale: oh god I'm forgetting, something something rational points
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:58:45] Yeah, there you go!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:58:47] hand wave hand wave QED
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:59:05] Each continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on rational points
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[09:59:13] yeah those are the words :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:00:00] So you have an injection from continuous functions R -> R to all functions Q -> R
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:00:15] and then it comes down to showing the latter set of functions has cardinality |R|
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:00:17] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:00:22] (which you can do with general theorems)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:00:33] (and the countability of Q)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:00:34] where "trivial" means "I am aware of such a proof" ;)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:00:51] *mumble* crazy diagonals *mumble*
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:01:03] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:01:03] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:01:43] How much work is left there is highly dependent on how much you know about cardinal numbers in general already.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:02:36] Cale: or how much you're allowed to use on the homework.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:02:55] We can form a (rather large) category whose objects are cardinal numbers, and whose arrows are injections between them.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:03:30] or any number of variations on that :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:04:24] Any ordinal number can be made a category based on its ordering, by the process I mentioned before.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:04:43] In particular, that gives you an example of a category for each natural number
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:05:14] Cale: which process?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:05:15] i.e. where the objects are the first n natural numbers {0,...,n-1} and there's exactly one arrow n -> m whenever n <= m, and none otherwise
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:05:22] Ah, I'll repeat it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:05:26] ahh.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:05:51] You can do this with any set S, and relation <= on S which is reflexive and transitive
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:05:52] no need, just many processes were discussed.  that little snippet was enough to figure it out.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:05:56] okay :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:07:26] So, in homotopy theory, groupoids show up very naturally as objects of study, because there you're interested in paths in topological spaces (If you don't know what topological spaces are in general, you can just think of subsets of R^n and get lots of nice examples of them that way)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:33] If S is some topological space, and x and y are points in S, then a path from x to y in S is defined as a continuous function [0,1] -> S (where [0,1] is the unit interval in the real numbers)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:08:34] Cale: oh right, posets require antisymmetry to avoid cycles
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:52] a continuous function f: [0,1] -> S such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:58] ReinH: right!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:09:51] Cale: is there some additional restriction on S other than 'subset', because with a general subset, 'continuous' doesn't make sense.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:10:00] mjrosenb: It still does make sense
2014-01-26 10:12:44	shachaf	[10:10:25] You can "collapse" a preorder into a poset of its cycles, which is roughly the same idea as the skeleton of a category.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:11:45] so if S = { n | n < 5 V n > 7 }, and x = 4, y = 8, what would a continuous function look like?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:12:03] shachaf: ah interesting
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:12:10] ah, well, there might not *be* such a path :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:12:50] mjrosenb: If for any x and y in S, we have a path from x to y, then S is called a path-connected space.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:13:22] Cale: gotcha.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:13:45] so no spaces that look like anti-swiss cheese.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:14:15] Anti-swiss-cheese spaces are okay as spaces, but they're not path connected, yeah.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:16:56] So, now we define an equivalence relation on paths from x to y, by saying that f,g : [0,1] -> S are equivalent when there is a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> S such that:
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:17:03] 1) H(0,x) = f(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:17:08] 2) H(1,x) = g(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:17:25] 3) H(t,0) = x for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:17:31] 3) H(t,1) = y for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:18:00] so this is defining a path between paths by defining a sheet that maps to the unit square?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:18:11] yeah, from the unit square
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:18:41] You can think of the t parameter as being like 'time', and H providing a sort of "animation" which starts with f and ends with g
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:18:42] yes, it can overlap itself.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:19:00] yeah, that is what I meant by path between paths.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:19:03] and where the endpoints stay fixed throughout
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:20:01] Given a topological space S, we can define a category where the objects are the points of S, and the arrows x -> y are the paths from x to y
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:20:05] up to equivalence
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:20:12] (i.e. equivalence classes of paths)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:21:30] For any point p in S, there is a constant path id_p : [0,1] -> S such that id_p(x) = p for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:22:00] (and we're really taking the identity arrow to be the equivalence class of paths containing that path)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:23:30] *nod*
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:23:31] For any path f from x to y and g from y to z, we can define a path g . f from x to z, which runs along f at double speed for values in [0,1/2] and then runs along g at double speed for values in [1/2,1]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:23:43] which would be the set of all loops that can be shrunk to a single point.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:23:54] and this turns out to be associative up to equivalence
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:24:23] yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:24:31] that's a nice category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:24:36] Cale: you are good at explaining things
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:24:41] pls to be writing a book
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:24:45] It's even nicer because every path also has an inverse
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:25:01] so it's a groupoid
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:25:05] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:25:07] nice
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:25:14] Cale: but seriously please write a book
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:25:23] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:25:43] Cale: one of the things we taked to byorgey about was the need for some sort of "Category Theory for the Working Haskeller"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:26:16] I realize there's Category Theory for Computer Scientists but I want a treatment especially for Haskell
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:26:32] bot cat theory and abstract algebra, in fact
2014-01-26 10:12:44	shachaf	[10:26:42] But note that it's *not* associative without doing the equivalence classes thing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:26:43] I would be worried that people might read my book before Awodey's :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:26:58] Cale: heh, well lots of haskellers aren't mathematicians :p
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:27:19] Well, sure
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:27:27] But if you're studying category theory
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:27:43] Cale: so, if the space looks like a donut, would the equivalence class of closed loops that go around the hole once be another set of identities?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:27:51] I think it's enough of a distraction that you perhaps shouldn't be scared that what you're learning is mathematics.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:28:06] Cale: right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:28:26] Cale: yeah, maybe what I want is really "Applied Category Theory for Haskellers"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:28:58] mjrosenb: They'd be distinct from the identity/constant path, yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:29:36] good, making correct observations about new systems *usually* means I understand what's going on.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:29:48] mjrosenb: It turns out to be really tricky to prove by direct means that R^2 and R^3 are not homeomorphic, i.e. that there are not continuous bijections in both directions between them which are inverses of each other
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:30:11] But we can get a proof of that by poking a hole in each of them by removing one point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:30:55] and then noting that when we remove a point from R^3, we can still contract any loop to a constant path
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:31:25] but if we remove a point from R^2, then a loop which goes around the hole can no longer be continuously contracted to a point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:31:57] Cale: ok, I understand the second part of that, but I still don't believe the first part.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:32:11] You mean the part about R^3?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:32:25] about r^2 and r^3 not being homeomorphic
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:32:26] Or that it's hard to show they're not isomorphic as topological spaces?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:32:56] Or do you think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic? :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	shachaf	[10:32:58] You would still have to show that homeomorphism ought to preserve this property.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:33:03] yeah, you would
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:33:38] There's still a lot of additional work here which I'm skimming over because I'm not giving a full course on this right now :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:33:54] But I just wanted to give an example of something we can do with this
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:33:59] Cale: I think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:34:03] ah, okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:34:10] Well, this provides a proof that they aren't after all
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:34:19] Cale: I'll believe it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:34:58] So, in addition to this groupoid I mentioned
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:35:13] If you pick any one point and consider the loops starting and ending at that point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:35:17] You get a group
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:35:44] That's called the fundamental group of the pointed topological space (and the groupoid I mentioned is called the fundamental groupoid)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:37:01] okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:37:04] So, functors
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:37:21] Given two categories C and D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:37:30] a functor F: C -> D consists of two things
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:37:46] 1) A mapping sending each object X in C to an object FX in D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:38:02] 2) A mapping sending each arrow  a: X -> Y in C, to an arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:38:21] such that for any object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:38:42] and for any arrows a and b which compose, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:40:03] Note that if a: Y -> Z and b: X -> Y are composable arrows, then you get a diagram which looks like a triangle with X, Y, Z as vertices, and a, b, and (a.b) as sides
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:40:11] in other words, it maps identity arrows to identity arrows
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:40:29] and "commutative triangles to commutative triangles"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:40:37] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:40:41] (though I hadn't actually introduced what commutative triangles are)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:41:14] draw them with ascii art
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:41:46] .oO(a diagrams 1.0 library to draw commutativity diagrams)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:41:52] since they just added arrows (the visual kind)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:41:54] A commutative diagram in a category is a collection of objects and arrows such that composing the arrows along any two paths with the same starting and ending point will give you an equal result
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:42:29] mjrosenb: okay?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:42:41] So a functor is a kind of structure-preserving map between categories
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:43:04] sec, catching up.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:43:34] Cale: and of course diagrams are functors and now I've gone all cross-eyed
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:45:09] yes, diagrams are functors (usually from some category with finitely many objects and arrows), and commutative diagrams are functors from a preorder category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:45:10] commutative triangle btw http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CommutativeTriangle_1000.gif
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[10:45:25] Cale: gotcha on all of this stuff, but I need to run plan some stuff for tomorrow.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:45:33] mjrosenb: okay, cool
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:45:44] mjrosenb: btw Awodey has a series of video lectures on youtube
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:45:48] cat theory lectures, that is
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:45:50] they are very good
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:46:16] So, the fundamental group of a pointed topological space gives an example of a functor
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:46:39] From the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:46:59] (that's a very nontrivial example)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:47:50] (and of course, once we've defined a category of groupoids and functors between them, then the fundamental groupoid of a space gives us another functor)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:48:16] and of course functors between categories form... a category.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:48:28] Turning continuous maps between spaces into functors between their fundamental groupoids :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:49:11] (these are perhaps not the best things to give as baby's first functors, but they're among the most remarkable examples in my mind)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:49:28] and now we can talk about the yoneda lemma :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:49:33] LOL
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:49:37] before he has to go
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:49:41] real quick
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:49:44] hahah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:55:23] Cale: and then we can talk about representable functors
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:55:36] Cale: and finally we can write a memoization library
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[10:56:06] this is of course the obvious way to derive momoization... if you are edwardk.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:58:45] I realise that's a typo, but I really want there to be an anime in which momoization is a thing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:02:33] Oh, I see how he's using them, okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:02:55] Representable profunctors
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:03:57] oh, and ordinary functors as well, okay
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[11:04:16] heh
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[11:04:46] Cale: to write a memoization library you must first derive the yoneda embedding. Or something.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:04:59] Well, it's sort of cheesy
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:05:24] The Yoneda stuff is all very flattened out when you try to squish it into Haskell
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:05:44] Remarkably, still resulting in something useful somehow!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[11:05:46] Cale: endofunctors make things a bit simpler eh?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[11:05:48] heh
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:06:10] But it loses most of its original point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[11:06:14] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:33] oh, yall are still going
2014-01-26 10:12:44	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:35] good good
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	joneshf-laptop [11:17:51] has a new favorite channel
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[11:37:25] look at all these words 0_0
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[11:47:52] wow   many word   very discussion   such category
2014-01-26 10:12:44	acowley	[12:25:47] Wow, Cale you really do a great job with these things.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	acowley	[12:26:00] You could provide commentary for Awodey's videos!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[12:56:08] ReinH: I have a tendency to not watch things (on youtube, or otherwise)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:57:49] mjrosenb: Awodey's lectures are definitely worth watching :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[12:58:04] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmodCApZwk
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[13:00:04] In 4-5 hours, he goes over quite a significant amount of material in a pretty coherent way. Probably you'd also want to stop at some points and read some stuff too though.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	mjrosenb	[13:32:00] Cale: perhaps this weekend.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[14:54:33] A lot of people recommend me Awodey's book and lectures but I just find his book extremely hard to graps, for some reason :( I only got luck after I read Pierce's book on CT
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[15:02:43] notdan: try catsters
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[15:04:35] Yeah I saw them; pretty much the same, unfortunately. But I got better at CT since I watched the Awodey's lectures, so I am giving the casters another shot
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[15:04:57] i watched catsters about 5 times before the stuff became intuitive
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[15:05:04] but catsters is fun, so
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[15:05:31] yeah I agree
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[01:43:05] Hi, can someone please check my proof that `Maybe` is a non-representable functor? http://covariant.me/stuff/tmp/nonrep.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[01:43:32] It looks sound to me, but I just started digging into that topic so there is a high chance I am missing something
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tomprince	[01:59:27] notdan: The typesetting of 'fmap' (there appears to almost be a space: 'f map') makes it a bit confusing to parse.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:00:34] I am sorry, I am typesetting it with \mathord
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:00:39] I wonder if there is a better solution
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:01:00] also the slight space between M and 'aybe'. annoying
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:02:16] Also, you seem to have swapped eta and eta^-1
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:03:12] It would be clearer if you write u = eta^-1_A (id_A) rather than u ~ id_A
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:04:52] So that you get for instance, that if eta^-1_A (id_A) = Nothing, then for any g: A -> B,  eta^-1_A g = eta^-1_A (g . id_A) = fmap g (eta^-1_A (id_A)) = fmap g Nothing = Nothing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:05:36] thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:05:43] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:06:16] it should be eta^-1_B (g), though?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:06:22] oh, oops, yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:06:27] In one case there :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:06:52] yeah, so every 'g' corresponds to Nothing, meaning that no function corresponds to 'Just'
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:07:02] so it's not a bijection
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:07:46] right, or you can explicitly give one which doesn't by using the supposedly inverse map, and show that Nothing = Just x for some x.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:09:01] Not sure what do you mean, sorry. Explicitly give = "... there exists g that corresponds to Just x"?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[02:09:20] ugg, silly hom functors...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[02:09:34] Hom(a, f) = f_* = f o -    right?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:10:05] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:10:10] yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[02:10:24] I always get those mixed up. Thanks :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:10:44] notdan: Well, eta_B (Just x) will be such a function
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:11:16] So on the one hand we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Just x
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:11:34] and on the other hand, we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Nothing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:11:35] Aaah, sorry, messed up explicitly vs implicitly here
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:11:41] Makes sense; thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:26:07] I still don't grasp what are representable functors good for
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:26:15] I read http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+functor#examples but I don't understand why I should care
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:30:03] notdan: Suppose that C is a Cartesian closed category with coproducts. Show that there is a natural isomorphism: (A x B) + (A x C) ~= A x (B + C).
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:31:09] (Try doing this from first principles, and then try doing it using Yoneda)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:32:44] The key thing is that there are all kinds of nice relationships between Hom and various other constructions.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	BullSherd	[02:32:49] Wow, Google is making really strange things http://goo.gl/YEkaMA
2014-01-26 10:12:44	BullSherd	[02:32:51] funny haha xD
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:33:02] spam link
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:36:32] doing it using Yoneda == show that their Hom-sets are equivalent?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:36:48] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:37:17] i.e. show that Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:43:12] I am sorry, I am not sure how to do that. I assume I have to dissect Hom(A x (B+C),X) into Hom(A,X) and Hom(B+C,X), but I am not sure how
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[02:43:41] Well, we have an isomorphism Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom(B + C, X^A)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[02:43:58] ah, I forgot about the exponentials
2014-01-26 10:12:44	NickKidman	[06:01:45] How do cardinal numbers relate to limits?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	NickKidman	[06:01:45] I figure both are obtained from many objects by a sort of orthogonal process, where we gather everything together and find an encompassing object.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tomprince	[06:06:00] cardinals are limits in the partial order on the ordinals. (They are a particular type of limit ordinal).
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:32:24] Cale: C is a.k.a. bicartesian closed in the above right?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:33:09] sure, if you like
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:33:49] Cale: and we can't just use the distribution of products over coproducts to show the above?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:34:04] Well, heh, if you assume it, that's rather trivial
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:34:21] Cale: ah, I thought it was axiomatic.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:34:25] but obv not
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:37:18] Cale: ah this is trying to show that the yoneda functor preserves isomorphisms right? Er, not preserves.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:37:28] some word that means the opposite of preserves.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:38:09] It's just serving as a useful tool to show that the isomorphisms already had to be there
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:38:37] e.g. if Ff : FA -> FB is an iso then f : A -> B is an iso
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:38:47] Yeah, where F = y here
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:38:52] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:39:12] Oh. Reflects. Thanks google.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:39:35] Well, and the special thing about y is that even if the arrow yA -> yB we constructed isn't explicitly of the form yf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:40:10] we know that there must be such an f
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:40:22] ah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:40:57] Cale: I can't see the proof of the above. But I can sort of view it dimly, as if from a great distance.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:41:24] (The Yoneda embedding is a bijection on hom sets)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[07:41:35] right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:42:35] So, we almost got there, if you'd like to see the rest of the steps -- really you'd have to show all of these are natural isomorphisms, but that's just a lot of tedious, but ultimately easy checking
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:42:48] So, starting from Hom(A x (B + C), X)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:43:04] this is isomorphic to Hom(B + C, X^A) (currying)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:43:27] and that's isomorphic to  Hom(B, X^A) x Hom(C, X^A)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:44:04] and then that's isomorphic to Hom(A x B, X) x Hom(A x C, X)  (uncurrying each of them)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:44:25] and then lastly we get to Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:45:53] So composing together that chain of isomorphisms (or rather the corresponding natural transformations in X) gets us an isomorphism: y (A x (B + C)) -> y ((A x B) + (A x C))
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[07:46:25] and then the Yoneda lemma tells us that there must really have been an isomorphism (A x (B + C)) -> ((A x B) + (A x C)) in the first place.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:52:13] ~the yoneeeeeda lemma~
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:52:49] that was the second to last lecture in Awodey's lectures, i think?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:53:02] i think its also the subject of the talk Reasoning Isomorphically
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:55:06] aha, reason, not reasoning
2014-01-26 10:12:44	augur_	[07:55:11] http://vimeo.com/16754927
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[08:06:32] Awodey also does this in his book
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[08:07:32] augur_: thanks for the link
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[08:07:33] Cale: reading
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[08:07:41] Cale: haven't gotten through the awodey book yet
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[08:08:46] Cale: and that last step is because of what we talked about before, that y reflects isos
2014-01-26 10:12:44	ReinH	[08:08:55] ok cool
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[21:07:48] Yay proved that respectful endofunctor is indeed a monad
2014-01-26 10:12:44	notdan	[21:08:28] proving the monadic laws in terms of 'join' and 'return' was fun, but def more harder than proving the usual (>=>) and return laws
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[09:44:15] If someone says F -| G : C -> D is an adjunction
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[09:44:24] That means F : C -> D as a functor and G goes the other way, right?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:55:49] Probably best to be careful about that. It's usually not hard to figure out what's meant in context.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:22] That would be a reasonable convention though.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:56:47] Though maybe it's specifying the type of G :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[09:57:10] (at the same time as saying that F is left adjoint to it)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[10:03:17] I guess I should ask Edwardk: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-4.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Co.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:07:00] Well, it doesn't matter which is C and D there, because those variables don't occur anywhere else
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[10:07:48] hm
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[10:07:52] I suppose your reasoning is sound
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[10:08:07] But still good to check if there's a general convention to this kind of thing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:12] ah, and his convention can be inferred from the next line
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:30] He says that GF is a monad on D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cale	[10:08:41] (and that GMF is too)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	tac	[10:08:43] ah, good point.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	tac [10:08:50] should take a nap instead of asking one-off questions on IRC

2014-01-26 22:35:28	NickKidman	Did anyone here read Lawveres introductory book "Conceptual mathematics"? Opinions on it? I'm reading it currently, and I find it curious how it's a high school book for 49 pages and then jumps 500% in demand.
2014-01-26 22:39:59	noteventime	NickKidman: I've taken a quick look at it, and recommended it to a mathematics interested non-mathematician friend of mine
2014-01-26 22:41:07	noteventime	Wasn't the jump a little like the jump you usually see after the "introduction to set theory" chapter you see in the beginning of a lot of mathematics textbooks :)
2014-01-26 22:44:00	NickKidman	noteventime: No, I mean it really gets suddently harder there. There he introduces the theorem-proof style simulatnously with the section/lifting/retraction concept
2014-01-26 22:44:38	NickKidman	I don't think it'll be an easy read for a non-mathematician, although I love the philosophical approach he makes
2014-01-26 22:44:55	Cale	I've read it
2014-01-26 22:45:01	noteventime	I think it's typical of Lawvere, the style I mean
2014-01-26 22:45:45	Cale	It's okay, it's really weird though.
2014-01-26 22:45:51	NickKidman	why
2014-01-26 22:46:13	Cale	If you're used to ordinary mathematics, the perspective he has is quite different :)
2014-01-26 22:47:33	NickKidman	what do you mean
2014-01-26 22:49:39	Cale	Well, it makes sense once you know what he's doing, he's developing a categorical presentation of a theory of sets. But for someone who is already quite familiar with ZFC set theory, say, it's a radically different approach.
2014-01-26 22:50:11	noteventime	What's the relation between Conceptual Mathematics and Sets for Mathematics btw
2014-01-26 22:50:16	noteventime	I never quite figured that out
2014-01-26 22:50:17	Cale	oh
2014-01-26 22:50:28	Cale	Right, I was thinking of Sets for Mathematics :)
2014-01-26 22:50:42	Cale	Because of the remarks that it was like a highschool book :)
2014-01-26 22:50:46	NickKidman	haha
2014-01-26 22:50:53	Cale	Perhaps conceptual mathematics is like that too!
2014-01-26 22:51:04	NickKidman	Cale: Well, yes, I think the description still fits

2014-01-26 22:51:25	noteventime	Cale: The way I remember it they were quite similar, though I think conceptual mathematics is more basic
2014-01-26 22:51:55	Cale	Oh, right, yes, I haven't read Conceptual Mathematics, but I have flipped through it before
2014-01-26 22:52:05	-->	dibblego (~nobody@14-202-85-190.static.tpgi.com.au) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-26 22:52:37	NickKidman	anyway, something else: A,B in a category, f:A->B a map. I am thinking about the element/global element perspective which I find conceptually interesting. If f is an A-element of B, then I think of A being embedded in B, right?
2014-01-26 22:52:37	NickKidman	I mean if S^2 is the sphere then smooth e: S^2->R^3 embed that ballsurface in R^3, I can make a mental image and I don't even bother about intersections (the fact that the thing might be deformed and different points of S^2 map to the same spot in R^3).
2014-01-26 22:52:37	NickKidman	But then if I consider space R^3 and a physical field, a section \psi in C^2 say, then I have
2014-01-26 22:52:37	NickKidman	\psi: R^3->C^2
2014-01-26 22:52:38	NickKidman	Can I think of this as R^3 embedded in C^2 somehow?
2014-01-26 22:55:05	Cale	Normally you don't use the word "embedding" unless it's injective.
2014-01-26 22:56:24	Cale	(and in some cases, you'd want to be more careful still, in topological settings, it's usual to say that an embedding f: X -> Y is a continuous map which induces a homeomorphism X -> f(X)
2014-01-26 22:56:27	Cale	)
2014-01-26 22:57:34	Cale	But yeah, you can think of any map X -> Y as squishing a copy of X and fitting it into Y somehow (in general it may not be injective)

2014-01-27 20:13:55	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:28:29] i just read some blog posts and got my first suspicion of possibly understanding a bit of the yoneda lemma. something about it reminds me of the notion of currying -- at least in the sense of both involving isomorphisms between some fairly abstract things. but i wonder if there's a more precise relation than that?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:28:32] string worldline diagrams
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:28:33] Are you familiar with the infinity category of cobordisms?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:28:42] no but thats ok
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:29:01] tpsinnem: yoneda is actually about continuations
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:29:07] if you programmatize it
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:29:22] Or infinity groupoid, I suppose
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:29:31] tpsinnem: in haskell, yoneda is really simple
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:29:47] augur: Basically, given two n-manifolds with boundary, the arrows between them are n+1 dimensional manifolds connecting one to the other
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:30:09] (or not connecting, they just fill the space in between somehow)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:30:15] tpsinnem:   fwd :: forall a f. Functor f => f a -> (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)   ;   fwd x = \f -> fmap f x
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:30:38] tpsinnem:    bwd :: forall a f. Functor f => (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r) -> f a   ;   bwd f = f id
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:31:06] Cale: ya
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:31:06] augur: it was in fact through a haskell post that i sort of started thinking i understand something
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:31:12] :)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:31:17] was it sigfpe's?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:31:32] hm, let be dig that back up
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:31:39] his is really good
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:31:42] tpsinnem: Have you read Awodey's presentation of the Yoneda lemma and surrounding material?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:32:33] http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/gadts.html
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:32:43] I didn't fully get the Yoneda lemma until I read his stuff on it.
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:33:23] In particular, the very important bit is that it acts as a sort of completion theorem for categories
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:33:24] Cale: i don't remember what precisely i had read earlier -- it's been a while and back then i didn't really get anywhere
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:33:41] tpsinnem: http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/11/yoneda-lemma.html
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:33:47] i will want to read different perspectives now that i seem to have gotten a bit of a grip on this
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:34:18] but in general actually i think i'll soon want to go through some basic CT texts with a bit more discipline than before
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:35:10] You can take any possibly badly behaved category, and embed it as a full subcategory of one which has all small limits and colimits, and has exponentials, and is a topos, and well, you have everything you could possibly want. You could interpret Coq in that category.
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:35:22] augur: yeah looks good
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:35:51] Cale: i still dont like that interpretation of ITT :\
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:35:54] and if you can show that there's an arrow between two objects of your original category using all the machinery there, then it must have already been there in the original cat
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:36:00] i much prefer the multicategory interpretation
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:37:16] i should go get food and then program
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[09:37:20] i have a revolution to start!
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tpsinnem	[09:37:21] anyhow, thanks for replies, as always :)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:37:45] tpsinnem: So, it's kind of like how we use the complex numbers to prove things about the real numbers
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[09:38:15] (Or we can use real numbers to prove things about rational ones)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[11:58:01] oh Cale
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[11:58:21] do you know of any ways of defining "obviousness" so that you can mechanically derive various obvious things in CT?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[11:59:28] augur: I strongly suspect there is a way, but I don't know what it is :)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[11:59:55] i was watching some catsters the other day and i thought that the definition of C/X looked like it ought to be derivable
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:00:33] Well, okay, also, if there's a way, then there's a way which just continues forever
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:00:43] sort of :)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:00:44] ?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:00:56] You have to decide when you're going to stop and make things equations
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:01:08] i suppose
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:02:42] Though I guess that's forced on you in many cases
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:03:22] Well, you could always decide that no, you were going to put in isomorphisms, but then maybe you want coherences between those and so on.
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:03:34] 0.0
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:06:43] like what happens in the definition of a monoidal category
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:06:56] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:07:29] This is a lot simpler if you insist that λ, ρ and α are all the identity, and you have equations
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:07:35] but then you lose most of your examples
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:08:09] and the coherence conditions are there to ensure that those isomorphisms have to work together somehow
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:10:49] but of course, you could get really silly and demand some kind of isomorphisms as additional fillers for the coherence conditions (but it's already pretty tiring by this point)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:11:07] If you had higher dimensional cells in your category, they would go in there though
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:14:21] (and you'd have higher dimensional pasting diagrams which would specify that those 2-cells for the pentagon diagram and triangle had to interact nicely somehow)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:16:57] hm
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:19:32] I'm sure you could write down in specific sorts of setups exactly what the laws were supposed to be though
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:20:10] Like, let's just say constructions involving a plain category, some endofunctors, and some natural transformations between words on those endofunctors
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:21:12] You want all the different ways of using the natural transformations to go between the same words to be equal.
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:22:27] i guess
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[12:22:33] it'd be interesting to see how to do that tho
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:28:28] actually, haha, I wonder if it's undecidable in general
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:28:38] Like, if it's equivalent to some word problem
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[12:32:30] (i.e. with the right mix of functors and natural transformations between words on them, it might be undecidable whether there's a way to reach the empty word from an arbitrary one)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[14:21:03] whats a good book to follow up Awodey's with?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	copumpkin	[14:24:52] TTT
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[14:37:39] copumpkin: TTT is so dense :(
2014-01-27 20:13:55	copumpkin	[14:37:54] how do you think I got so dense?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[14:38:00] lolol
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[14:38:07] its also aimed towards people with a more mathematical background
2014-01-27 20:13:55	tac	[14:40:13] So just become a mathematician like the rest of #haskell-blah, augur
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[14:40:18] :P
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:41:46] ahh man
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:41:57] the proof that the yoneda embedding is indeed an embedding is so beautiful
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:42:18] once you have the yoneda lemma, its literally just.. there
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:44:28] yoneda-lemma : forall C F. Hom(yC,F) ~ FC   suppose C, D. yoneda-lemma(C,yD) : Hom(yC,yD) ~ yDC == Hom(yC,yD) ~ Hom(C,D)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:44:43] and thats your proof of embedding.
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:45:01] its literally just instantiation of the lemma at C = C, F = yD
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:45:13] mind blowingly great
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:56:00] i mean its not like i didnt know this already, but its like a beautiful piece of music, you know?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[16:56:19] when you see it again after a while, you cant help but appreciate its beauty
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[18:14:59] hmm hmm
2014-01-27 20:13:55	augur	[18:15:44] i wish there was a nice little catalog of categorical constructions like various kinds of (co)limits etc using progressively more complex ideas
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:17:28] is it easy to show that the free (weak omega) groupoid generated by id_A is the same as Hom_A? (with A a (weak omega) groupoid as well)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:18:43] or is it true at all? it seems implied by how people are fine with the inductive definition of identity types
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Cale	[22:21:05] What do you mean by "generated by id_A"?
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:22:57] oh, right, that doesn't make much sense
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:23:26] i guess i want id_x for each x in Obj(A)
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:24:26] but the fact that it's an indexed type might make this less sensical than i'm imagining
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:28:24] my point is that if the circle is the free groupoid generated by a 0-cell "base" and a 1-cell "loop : base -> base" then the inductive definition of Id_A should have a similar reading which i'm trying to figure out
2014-01-27 20:13:55	Saizan	[22:29:33] and the right one should be something equivalent to Hom_A
2014-01-27 20:13:55	RichyB	[21:22:17] help help I tried reading "Conceptual Mathematics" and now i don't understand maths without arrows in it D:
2014-01-27 20:13:55	mr-	[21:24:43] RichyB: translate it to math with arrows!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	RichyB	[21:25:48] Hee. ☺ It's impressive how well the category-theory-mafia is doing on wikipedia at adding (brief!) categorical descriptions to articles about other areas of mathematics. ☺
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ski	[00:07:38] RichyB : i believe "category terrorists" is the preferred terminology
2014-01-27 20:13:56	RichyB	[00:27:38] ski, I love it! :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:52:15] RichyB is british
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:52:32] or so the s in "maths" predicts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:52:39] mr- is not british
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ion	[08:46:38] Britishe mathes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:37:42] okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:38:25] So, let's see some examples
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:38:59] mjrosenb: I don't know what your mathematical background is like, but every branch of mathematics has at least one, if not many rich examples to offer
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:40:05] The idea being that every branch of mathematics is interested in studying some class of objects along with structure-preserving mappings of some sort between those objects, and generally those mappings can be composed in an associative fashion
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:40:06] Cale: pretty sure I took something from every sub-field of math that was offered while I was an undergrad.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:40:17] ah, cool, okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:40:34] So, you have a category of vector spaces and linear transformations between them
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:40:43] and a category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:40:55] and a category of topological spaces and continuous maps
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:41:11] a category of graphs and graph homomorphisms (of various sorts)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:41:18] a category of metric spaces and contraction mappings
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:42:40] Every monoid provides an example of a category in the way I mentioned already: you can build a category with a single object, and take the arrows from that object to itself to be the elements of the monoid, and the composition of arrows to be the monoid multiplication.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:42:58] ahh, topology, there was a conflict when that was offered :-(
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:43:15] anyhow, linear algebra was fun, how about an example from that?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:43:40] Yeah, so given any field F, there's a category whose objects are vector spaces over F
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:44:21] and whose arrows are linear transformations between the vector spaces
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:44:40] Composing linear transformations gives us a linear transformation
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:44:51] (i.e. composing them as functions)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:45:20] and linear transforms are associative.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:45:21] and for every vector space there is an identity linear transformation
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:45:25] and yeah, composition is associative
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:45:36] and so that defines a category
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:45:51] As a weirder example
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:46:09] Let S be any set, and let <= be any reflexive, transitive relation on S
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:46:23] mjrosenb: I mentioned that one in #haskell too: The category Mat(F) is the category of matrices over some field F :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:46:33] i.e. for all x in S, we have x <= x, and for any x, y, z in S, whenever x <= y and y <= z, we have x <= z
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:46:43] Then we can make a category whose objects are the elements of S
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:46:57] and where there is exactly one arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:47:00] and no arrow otherwise
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:47:23] (btw, such a relation is called a preorder)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:47:33] This is a poset category iinm
2014-01-27 20:13:56	copumpkin	[09:47:40] Cale: like what I do on amazon, right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:47:47] Cale: so in the first example, the number of elements in the vector is fixed, and the number of objects in the category is dependent on the number of elements in F?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:47:52] Which has a lot of objects and relatively few arrows
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:47:52] Well, it's a poset category if the preorder happens to be a poset
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:48:13] Compared to a monoid or group, which has a lot of arrows and relatively few objects (in fact, only one).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:48:23] mjrosenb: The objects in the category of vector spaces are themselves entire vector spaces
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:48:25] Cale: righto
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:48:36] For example, if we pick F to be the real numbers
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:48:44] Cale: oh um... oh.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:48:46] Then R^n for each n will be an object of the category
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:48:59] As will the space of continuous maps R -> R
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:49:15] and all sorts of weirder examples of vector spaces over the reals
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:50:13] (each of these sets coming equipped with the operations which make it a vector space of course)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:50:28] Cale: so the linear transforms would be arrows from R^2 to R^2, but is there anything between two distinct objects in the category?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:50:38] Cale: continuous maps R->R is a fun one.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:50:56] mjrosenb: There are plenty of linear maps R^n -> R^m in general
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:51:03] the proof that it is the same size as R was one of the ugliest proofs I ever wrote.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:51:31] (they correspond to n-by-m matrices, remember)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:51:52] mjrosenb: why? :P |RxR| = |R| trivially :p
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:52:13] ReinH: The set of all functions R -> R has greater cardinality than R
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:52:25] Cale: oh, linear maps, not linear transforms.  (I took linear algebra in 2005, I may be a bit of on the terminology, still remember the concepts though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:52:28] (it has cardinality 2^|R|)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:52:43] mjrosenb: nono, linear transformations are the same thing :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:53:17] Remember if V and W are vector spaces over F, then a linear transformation (or linear map)  T: V -> W is a function such that
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[09:53:20] Cale: hrmm, what is the thing that is represented by foo a vec = [a*x | x <- vec]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:53:42] for any u,v in V, we have T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:53:55] Cale: right, which is P(R)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:53:56] and for any a in F and v in V, we have T(a*v) = a*T(v)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:54:21] er, which is equal to |P(R)|
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:54:49] ReinH: So, the hard part is showing that if you restrict to just the continuous ones, then the cardinality is the same as that of the reals.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:54:51] Cale: but I said RxR, not R^R :p Maybe I misunderstood what mjrosenb was saying.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:55:01] Cale: ah.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:55:13] ReinH: I don't know what R x R has to do with it, but maybe you have some idea for the proof :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:01] mjrosenb: Our vectors here are just abstract things which have an addition and scalar multiplication defined on them, so they needn't actually be tuples of real numbers
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:56:16] Cale: uh, the cardinality is at least |R| because of const
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:18] (but in some cases of course they will be)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:32] ReinH: right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:56:41] Cale: and at most |R| because the set of real continuous functions injects into R^2
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:49] how?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:57:08] (it does, but that's not exactly *simple* :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	mjrosenb [09:57:16] is curious about that injection as well.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:57:40] Sorry, R^N
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:58:11] R^N could work
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	mjrosenb [09:58:31] is not convinced  R^N is easy.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:58:35] Cale: oh god I'm forgetting, something something rational points
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:58:45] Yeah, there you go!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:58:47] hand wave hand wave QED
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:59:05] Each continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on rational points
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[09:59:13] yeah those are the words :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:00:00] So you have an injection from continuous functions R -> R to all functions Q -> R
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:00:15] and then it comes down to showing the latter set of functions has cardinality |R|
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:00:17] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:00:22] (which you can do with general theorems)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:00:33] (and the countability of Q)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:00:34] where "trivial" means "I am aware of such a proof" ;)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:00:51] *mumble* crazy diagonals *mumble*
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:01:03] yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:01:03] :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:01:43] How much work is left there is highly dependent on how much you know about cardinal numbers in general already.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:02:36] Cale: or how much you're allowed to use on the homework.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:02:55] We can form a (rather large) category whose objects are cardinal numbers, and whose arrows are injections between them.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:03:30] or any number of variations on that :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:04:24] Any ordinal number can be made a category based on its ordering, by the process I mentioned before.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:04:43] In particular, that gives you an example of a category for each natural number
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:05:14] Cale: which process?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:05:15] i.e. where the objects are the first n natural numbers {0,...,n-1} and there's exactly one arrow n -> m whenever n <= m, and none otherwise
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:05:22] Ah, I'll repeat it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:05:26] ahh.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:05:51] You can do this with any set S, and relation <= on S which is reflexive and transitive
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:05:52] no need, just many processes were discussed.  that little snippet was enough to figure it out.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:05:56] okay :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:07:26] So, in homotopy theory, groupoids show up very naturally as objects of study, because there you're interested in paths in topological spaces (If you don't know what topological spaces are in general, you can just think of subsets of R^n and get lots of nice examples of them that way)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:33] If S is some topological space, and x and y are points in S, then a path from x to y in S is defined as a continuous function [0,1] -> S (where [0,1] is the unit interval in the real numbers)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:08:34] Cale: oh right, posets require antisymmetry to avoid cycles
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:52] a continuous function f: [0,1] -> S such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:58] ReinH: right!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:09:51] Cale: is there some additional restriction on S other than 'subset', because with a general subset, 'continuous' doesn't make sense.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:10:00] mjrosenb: It still does make sense
2014-01-27 20:13:56	shachaf	[10:10:25] You can "collapse" a preorder into a poset of its cycles, which is roughly the same idea as the skeleton of a category.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:11:45] so if S = { n | n < 5 V n > 7 }, and x = 4, y = 8, what would a continuous function look like?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:12:03] shachaf: ah interesting
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:12:10] ah, well, there might not *be* such a path :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:12:50] mjrosenb: If for any x and y in S, we have a path from x to y, then S is called a path-connected space.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:13:22] Cale: gotcha.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:13:45] so no spaces that look like anti-swiss cheese.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:14:15] Anti-swiss-cheese spaces are okay as spaces, but they're not path connected, yeah.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:16:56] So, now we define an equivalence relation on paths from x to y, by saying that f,g : [0,1] -> S are equivalent when there is a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> S such that:
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:17:03] 1) H(0,x) = f(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:17:08] 2) H(1,x) = g(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:17:25] 3) H(t,0) = x for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:17:31] 3) H(t,1) = y for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:18:00] so this is defining a path between paths by defining a sheet that maps to the unit square?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:18:11] yeah, from the unit square
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:18:41] You can think of the t parameter as being like 'time', and H providing a sort of "animation" which starts with f and ends with g
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:18:42] yes, it can overlap itself.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:19:00] yeah, that is what I meant by path between paths.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:19:03] and where the endpoints stay fixed throughout
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:20:01] Given a topological space S, we can define a category where the objects are the points of S, and the arrows x -> y are the paths from x to y
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:20:05] up to equivalence
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:20:12] (i.e. equivalence classes of paths)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:21:30] For any point p in S, there is a constant path id_p : [0,1] -> S such that id_p(x) = p for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:22:00] (and we're really taking the identity arrow to be the equivalence class of paths containing that path)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:23:30] *nod*
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:23:31] For any path f from x to y and g from y to z, we can define a path g . f from x to z, which runs along f at double speed for values in [0,1/2] and then runs along g at double speed for values in [1/2,1]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:23:43] which would be the set of all loops that can be shrunk to a single point.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:23:54] and this turns out to be associative up to equivalence
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:24:23] yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:24:31] that's a nice category
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:24:36] Cale: you are good at explaining things
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:24:41] pls to be writing a book
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:24:45] It's even nicer because every path also has an inverse
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:25:01] so it's a groupoid
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:25:05] yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:25:07] nice
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:25:14] Cale: but seriously please write a book
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:25:23] :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:25:43] Cale: one of the things we taked to byorgey about was the need for some sort of "Category Theory for the Working Haskeller"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:26:16] I realize there's Category Theory for Computer Scientists but I want a treatment especially for Haskell
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:26:32] bot cat theory and abstract algebra, in fact
2014-01-27 20:13:56	shachaf	[10:26:42] But note that it's *not* associative without doing the equivalence classes thing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:26:43] I would be worried that people might read my book before Awodey's :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:26:58] Cale: heh, well lots of haskellers aren't mathematicians :p
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:27:19] Well, sure
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:27:27] But if you're studying category theory
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:27:43] Cale: so, if the space looks like a donut, would the equivalence class of closed loops that go around the hole once be another set of identities?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:27:51] I think it's enough of a distraction that you perhaps shouldn't be scared that what you're learning is mathematics.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:28:06] Cale: right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:28:26] Cale: yeah, maybe what I want is really "Applied Category Theory for Haskellers"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:28:58] mjrosenb: They'd be distinct from the identity/constant path, yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:29:36] good, making correct observations about new systems *usually* means I understand what's going on.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:29:48] mjrosenb: It turns out to be really tricky to prove by direct means that R^2 and R^3 are not homeomorphic, i.e. that there are not continuous bijections in both directions between them which are inverses of each other
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:30:11] But we can get a proof of that by poking a hole in each of them by removing one point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:30:55] and then noting that when we remove a point from R^3, we can still contract any loop to a constant path
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:31:25] but if we remove a point from R^2, then a loop which goes around the hole can no longer be continuously contracted to a point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:31:57] Cale: ok, I understand the second part of that, but I still don't believe the first part.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:32:11] You mean the part about R^3?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:32:25] about r^2 and r^3 not being homeomorphic
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:32:26] Or that it's hard to show they're not isomorphic as topological spaces?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:32:56] Or do you think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic? :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	shachaf	[10:32:58] You would still have to show that homeomorphism ought to preserve this property.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:33:03] yeah, you would
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:33:38] There's still a lot of additional work here which I'm skimming over because I'm not giving a full course on this right now :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:33:54] But I just wanted to give an example of something we can do with this
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:33:59] Cale: I think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:34:03] ah, okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:34:10] Well, this provides a proof that they aren't after all
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:34:19] Cale: I'll believe it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:34:58] So, in addition to this groupoid I mentioned
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:35:13] If you pick any one point and consider the loops starting and ending at that point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:35:17] You get a group
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:35:44] That's called the fundamental group of the pointed topological space (and the groupoid I mentioned is called the fundamental groupoid)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:37:01] okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:37:04] So, functors
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:37:21] Given two categories C and D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:37:30] a functor F: C -> D consists of two things
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:37:46] 1) A mapping sending each object X in C to an object FX in D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:38:02] 2) A mapping sending each arrow  a: X -> Y in C, to an arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:38:21] such that for any object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:38:42] and for any arrows a and b which compose, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:40:03] Note that if a: Y -> Z and b: X -> Y are composable arrows, then you get a diagram which looks like a triangle with X, Y, Z as vertices, and a, b, and (a.b) as sides
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:40:11] in other words, it maps identity arrows to identity arrows
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:40:29] and "commutative triangles to commutative triangles"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:40:37] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:40:41] (though I hadn't actually introduced what commutative triangles are)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:41:14] draw them with ascii art
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:41:46] .oO(a diagrams 1.0 library to draw commutativity diagrams)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:41:52] since they just added arrows (the visual kind)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:41:54] A commutative diagram in a category is a collection of objects and arrows such that composing the arrows along any two paths with the same starting and ending point will give you an equal result
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:42:29] mjrosenb: okay?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:42:41] So a functor is a kind of structure-preserving map between categories
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:43:04] sec, catching up.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:43:34] Cale: and of course diagrams are functors and now I've gone all cross-eyed
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:45:09] yes, diagrams are functors (usually from some category with finitely many objects and arrows), and commutative diagrams are functors from a preorder category
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:45:10] commutative triangle btw http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CommutativeTriangle_1000.gif
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[10:45:25] Cale: gotcha on all of this stuff, but I need to run plan some stuff for tomorrow.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:45:33] mjrosenb: okay, cool
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:45:44] mjrosenb: btw Awodey has a series of video lectures on youtube
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:45:48] cat theory lectures, that is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:45:50] they are very good
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:46:16] So, the fundamental group of a pointed topological space gives an example of a functor
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:46:39] From the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:46:59] (that's a very nontrivial example)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:47:50] (and of course, once we've defined a category of groupoids and functors between them, then the fundamental groupoid of a space gives us another functor)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:48:16] and of course functors between categories form... a category.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:48:28] Turning continuous maps between spaces into functors between their fundamental groupoids :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:49:11] (these are perhaps not the best things to give as baby's first functors, but they're among the most remarkable examples in my mind)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:49:28] and now we can talk about the yoneda lemma :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:49:33] LOL
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:49:37] before he has to go
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:49:41] real quick
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:49:44] hahah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:55:23] Cale: and then we can talk about representable functors
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:55:36] Cale: and finally we can write a memoization library
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[10:56:06] this is of course the obvious way to derive momoization... if you are edwardk.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:58:45] I realise that's a typo, but I really want there to be an anime in which momoization is a thing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:02:33] Oh, I see how he's using them, okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:02:55] Representable profunctors
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:03:57] oh, and ordinary functors as well, okay
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[11:04:16] heh
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[11:04:46] Cale: to write a memoization library you must first derive the yoneda embedding. Or something.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:04:59] Well, it's sort of cheesy
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:05:24] The Yoneda stuff is all very flattened out when you try to squish it into Haskell
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:05:44] Remarkably, still resulting in something useful somehow!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[11:05:46] Cale: endofunctors make things a bit simpler eh?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[11:05:48] heh
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:06:10] But it loses most of its original point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[11:06:14] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:33] oh, yall are still going
2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:35] good good
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	joneshf-laptop [11:17:51] has a new favorite channel
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[11:37:25] look at all these words 0_0
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[11:47:52] wow   many word   very discussion   such category
2014-01-27 20:13:56	acowley	[12:25:47] Wow, Cale you really do a great job with these things.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	acowley	[12:26:00] You could provide commentary for Awodey's videos!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[12:56:08] ReinH: I have a tendency to not watch things (on youtube, or otherwise)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[12:57:49] mjrosenb: Awodey's lectures are definitely worth watching :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[12:58:04] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmodCApZwk
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[13:00:04] In 4-5 hours, he goes over quite a significant amount of material in a pretty coherent way. Probably you'd also want to stop at some points and read some stuff too though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	mjrosenb	[13:32:00] Cale: perhaps this weekend.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[14:54:33] A lot of people recommend me Awodey's book and lectures but I just find his book extremely hard to graps, for some reason :( I only got luck after I read Pierce's book on CT
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[15:02:43] notdan: try catsters
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[15:04:35] Yeah I saw them; pretty much the same, unfortunately. But I got better at CT since I watched the Awodey's lectures, so I am giving the casters another shot
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[15:04:57] i watched catsters about 5 times before the stuff became intuitive
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[15:05:04] but catsters is fun, so
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[15:05:31] yeah I agree
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[01:43:05] Hi, can someone please check my proof that `Maybe` is a non-representable functor? http://covariant.me/stuff/tmp/nonrep.html
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[01:43:32] It looks sound to me, but I just started digging into that topic so there is a high chance I am missing something
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tomprince	[01:59:27] notdan: The typesetting of 'fmap' (there appears to almost be a space: 'f map') makes it a bit confusing to parse.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:00:34] I am sorry, I am typesetting it with \mathord
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:00:39] I wonder if there is a better solution
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:01:00] also the slight space between M and 'aybe'. annoying
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:02:16] Also, you seem to have swapped eta and eta^-1
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:03:12] It would be clearer if you write u = eta^-1_A (id_A) rather than u ~ id_A
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:04:52] So that you get for instance, that if eta^-1_A (id_A) = Nothing, then for any g: A -> B,  eta^-1_A g = eta^-1_A (g . id_A) = fmap g (eta^-1_A (id_A)) = fmap g Nothing = Nothing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:05:36] thanks
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:05:43] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:06:16] it should be eta^-1_B (g), though?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:06:22] oh, oops, yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:06:27] In one case there :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:06:52] yeah, so every 'g' corresponds to Nothing, meaning that no function corresponds to 'Just'
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:07:02] so it's not a bijection
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:07:46] right, or you can explicitly give one which doesn't by using the supposedly inverse map, and show that Nothing = Just x for some x.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:09:01] Not sure what do you mean, sorry. Explicitly give = "... there exists g that corresponds to Just x"?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[02:09:20] ugg, silly hom functors...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[02:09:34] Hom(a, f) = f_* = f o -    right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:10:05] yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:10:10] yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[02:10:24] I always get those mixed up. Thanks :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:10:44] notdan: Well, eta_B (Just x) will be such a function
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:11:16] So on the one hand we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Just x
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:11:34] and on the other hand, we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Nothing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:11:35] Aaah, sorry, messed up explicitly vs implicitly here
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:11:41] Makes sense; thanks
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:26:07] I still don't grasp what are representable functors good for
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:26:15] I read http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+functor#examples but I don't understand why I should care
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:30:03] notdan: Suppose that C is a Cartesian closed category with coproducts. Show that there is a natural isomorphism: (A x B) + (A x C) ~= A x (B + C).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:31:09] (Try doing this from first principles, and then try doing it using Yoneda)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:32:44] The key thing is that there are all kinds of nice relationships between Hom and various other constructions.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	BullSherd	[02:32:49] Wow, Google is making really strange things http://goo.gl/YEkaMA
2014-01-27 20:13:56	BullSherd	[02:32:51] funny haha xD
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:33:02] spam link
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:36:32] doing it using Yoneda == show that their Hom-sets are equivalent?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:36:48] yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:37:17] i.e. show that Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:43:12] I am sorry, I am not sure how to do that. I assume I have to dissect Hom(A x (B+C),X) into Hom(A,X) and Hom(B+C,X), but I am not sure how
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[02:43:41] Well, we have an isomorphism Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom(B + C, X^A)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[02:43:58] ah, I forgot about the exponentials
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[06:01:45] How do cardinal numbers relate to limits?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[06:01:45] I figure both are obtained from many objects by a sort of orthogonal process, where we gather everything together and find an encompassing object.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tomprince	[06:06:00] cardinals are limits in the partial order on the ordinals. (They are a particular type of limit ordinal).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:32:24] Cale: C is a.k.a. bicartesian closed in the above right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:33:09] sure, if you like
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:33:49] Cale: and we can't just use the distribution of products over coproducts to show the above?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:34:04] Well, heh, if you assume it, that's rather trivial
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:34:21] Cale: ah, I thought it was axiomatic.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:34:25] but obv not
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:37:18] Cale: ah this is trying to show that the yoneda functor preserves isomorphisms right? Er, not preserves.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:37:28] some word that means the opposite of preserves.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:38:09] It's just serving as a useful tool to show that the isomorphisms already had to be there
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:38:37] e.g. if Ff : FA -> FB is an iso then f : A -> B is an iso
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:38:47] Yeah, where F = y here
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:38:52] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:39:12] Oh. Reflects. Thanks google.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:39:35] Well, and the special thing about y is that even if the arrow yA -> yB we constructed isn't explicitly of the form yf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:40:10] we know that there must be such an f
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:40:22] ah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:40:57] Cale: I can't see the proof of the above. But I can sort of view it dimly, as if from a great distance.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:41:24] (The Yoneda embedding is a bijection on hom sets)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[07:41:35] right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:42:35] So, we almost got there, if you'd like to see the rest of the steps -- really you'd have to show all of these are natural isomorphisms, but that's just a lot of tedious, but ultimately easy checking
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:42:48] So, starting from Hom(A x (B + C), X)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:43:04] this is isomorphic to Hom(B + C, X^A) (currying)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:43:27] and that's isomorphic to  Hom(B, X^A) x Hom(C, X^A)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:44:04] and then that's isomorphic to Hom(A x B, X) x Hom(A x C, X)  (uncurrying each of them)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:44:25] and then lastly we get to Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:45:53] So composing together that chain of isomorphisms (or rather the corresponding natural transformations in X) gets us an isomorphism: y (A x (B + C)) -> y ((A x B) + (A x C))
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[07:46:25] and then the Yoneda lemma tells us that there must really have been an isomorphism (A x (B + C)) -> ((A x B) + (A x C)) in the first place.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:52:13] ~the yoneeeeeda lemma~
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:52:49] that was the second to last lecture in Awodey's lectures, i think?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:53:02] i think its also the subject of the talk Reasoning Isomorphically
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:55:06] aha, reason, not reasoning
2014-01-27 20:13:56	augur_	[07:55:11] http://vimeo.com/16754927
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[08:06:32] Awodey also does this in his book
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[08:07:32] augur_: thanks for the link
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[08:07:33] Cale: reading
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[08:07:41] Cale: haven't gotten through the awodey book yet
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[08:08:46] Cale: and that last step is because of what we talked about before, that y reflects isos
2014-01-27 20:13:56	ReinH	[08:08:55] ok cool
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[21:07:48] Yay proved that respectful endofunctor is indeed a monad
2014-01-27 20:13:56	notdan	[21:08:28] proving the monadic laws in terms of 'join' and 'return' was fun, but def more harder than proving the usual (>=>) and return laws
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[09:44:15] If someone says F -| G : C -> D is an adjunction
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[09:44:24] That means F : C -> D as a functor and G goes the other way, right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:55:49] Probably best to be careful about that. It's usually not hard to figure out what's meant in context.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:22] That would be a reasonable convention though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:56:47] Though maybe it's specifying the type of G :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[09:57:10] (at the same time as saying that F is left adjoint to it)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[10:03:17] I guess I should ask Edwardk: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-4.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Co.html
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:07:00] Well, it doesn't matter which is C and D there, because those variables don't occur anywhere else
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[10:07:48] hm
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[10:07:52] I suppose your reasoning is sound
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[10:08:07] But still good to check if there's a general convention to this kind of thing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:12] ah, and his convention can be inferred from the next line
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:30] He says that GF is a monad on D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:08:41] (and that GMF is too)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	tac	[10:08:43] ah, good point.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	tac [10:08:50] should take a nap instead of asking one-off questions on IRC
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:35:28] Did anyone here read Lawveres introductory book "Conceptual mathematics"? Opinions on it? I'm reading it currently, and I find it curious how it's a high school book for 49 pages and then jumps 500% in demand.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:39:59] NickKidman: I've taken a quick look at it, and recommended it to a mathematics interested non-mathematician friend of mine
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:41:07] Wasn't the jump a little like the jump you usually see after the "introduction to set theory" chapter you see in the beginning of a lot of mathematics textbooks :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:44:00] noteventime: No, I mean it really gets suddently harder there. There he introduces the theorem-proof style simulatnously with the section/lifting/retraction concept
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:44:38] I don't think it'll be an easy read for a non-mathematician, although I love the philosophical approach he makes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:44:55] I've read it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:45:01] I think it's typical of Lawvere, the style I mean
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:45:45] It's okay, it's really weird though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:45:51] why
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:46:13] If you're used to ordinary mathematics, the perspective he has is quite different :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:47:33] what do you mean
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:49:39] Well, it makes sense once you know what he's doing, he's developing a categorical presentation of a theory of sets. But for someone who is already quite familiar with ZFC set theory, say, it's a radically different approach.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:50:11] What's the relation between Conceptual Mathematics and Sets for Mathematics btw
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:50:16] I never quite figured that out
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:50:17] oh
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:50:28] Right, I was thinking of Sets for Mathematics :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:50:42] Because of the remarks that it was like a highschool book :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:50:46] haha
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:50:53] Perhaps conceptual mathematics is like that too!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:51:04] Cale: Well, yes, I think the description still fits
2014-01-27 20:13:56	noteventime	[22:51:25] Cale: The way I remember it they were quite similar, though I think conceptual mathematics is more basic
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:51:55] Oh, right, yes, I haven't read Conceptual Mathematics, but I have flipped through it before
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:52:37] anyway, something else: A,B in a category, f:A->B a map. I am thinking about the element/global element perspective which I find conceptually interesting. If f is an A-element of B, then I think of A being embedded in B, right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:52:37] I mean if S^2 is the sphere then smooth e: S^2->R^3 embed that ballsurface in R^3, I can make a mental image and I don't even bother about intersections (the fact that the thing might be deformed and different points of S^2 map to the same spot in R^3).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:52:37] But then if I consider space R^3 and a physical field, a section \psi in C^2 say, then I have
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:52:37] \psi: R^3->C^2
2014-01-27 20:13:56	NickKidman	[22:52:38] Can I think of this as R^3 embedded in C^2 somehow?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:55:05] Normally you don't use the word "embedding" unless it's injective.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:56:24] (and in some cases, you'd want to be more careful still, in topological settings, it's usual to say that an embedding f: X -> Y is a continuous map which induces a homeomorphism X -> f(X)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:56:27] )
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[22:57:34] But yeah, you can think of any map X -> Y as squishing a copy of X and fitting it into Y somehow (in general it may not be injective)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[10:30:26] here's a fun game:
2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[10:31:01] google "cftwm mac lane", then try to figure out what cftwm is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[10:32:09] it's like the acronym is not in the vicinity of the book title
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:39:14] huh?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:40:20] oh, if you're trying to guess it just from google results?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:40:59] hah, I get a log from #haskell in 2007 which reveals it, as the last result
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:41:08] while searching with: cftwm maclane
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:41:18] haskell-2007-03-17
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cale	[10:41:19] tuukka.iki.fi/tmp/haskell-2007-03-17‎

2014-01-27 20:13:56	joneshf-laptop	[11:06:57] yeah :)

2014-01-28 09:22:42	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:37:42] okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:38:25] So, let's see some examples
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:38:59] mjrosenb: I don't know what your mathematical background is like, but every branch of mathematics has at least one, if not many rich examples to offer
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:40:05] The idea being that every branch of mathematics is interested in studying some class of objects along with structure-preserving mappings of some sort between those objects, and generally those mappings can be composed in an associative fashion
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:40:06] Cale: pretty sure I took something from every sub-field of math that was offered while I was an undergrad.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:40:17] ah, cool, okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:40:34] So, you have a category of vector spaces and linear transformations between them
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:40:43] and a category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:40:55] and a category of topological spaces and continuous maps
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:41:11] a category of graphs and graph homomorphisms (of various sorts)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:41:18] a category of metric spaces and contraction mappings
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:42:40] Every monoid provides an example of a category in the way I mentioned already: you can build a category with a single object, and take the arrows from that object to itself to be the elements of the monoid, and the composition of arrows to be the monoid multiplication.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:42:58] ahh, topology, there was a conflict when that was offered :-(
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:43:15] anyhow, linear algebra was fun, how about an example from that?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:43:40] Yeah, so given any field F, there's a category whose objects are vector spaces over F
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:44:21] and whose arrows are linear transformations between the vector spaces
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:44:40] Composing linear transformations gives us a linear transformation
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:44:51] (i.e. composing them as functions)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:45:20] and linear transforms are associative.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:45:21] and for every vector space there is an identity linear transformation
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:45:25] and yeah, composition is associative
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:45:36] and so that defines a category
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:45:51] As a weirder example
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:46:09] Let S be any set, and let <= be any reflexive, transitive relation on S
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:46:23] mjrosenb: I mentioned that one in #haskell too: The category Mat(F) is the category of matrices over some field F :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:46:33] i.e. for all x in S, we have x <= x, and for any x, y, z in S, whenever x <= y and y <= z, we have x <= z
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:46:43] Then we can make a category whose objects are the elements of S
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:46:57] and where there is exactly one arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:47:00] and no arrow otherwise
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:47:23] (btw, such a relation is called a preorder)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:47:33] This is a poset category iinm
2014-01-28 09:22:42	copumpkin	[09:47:40] Cale: like what I do on amazon, right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:47:47] Cale: so in the first example, the number of elements in the vector is fixed, and the number of objects in the category is dependent on the number of elements in F?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:47:52] Which has a lot of objects and relatively few arrows
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:47:52] Well, it's a poset category if the preorder happens to be a poset
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:48:13] Compared to a monoid or group, which has a lot of arrows and relatively few objects (in fact, only one).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:48:23] mjrosenb: The objects in the category of vector spaces are themselves entire vector spaces
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:48:25] Cale: righto
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:48:36] For example, if we pick F to be the real numbers
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:48:44] Cale: oh um... oh.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:48:46] Then R^n for each n will be an object of the category
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:48:59] As will the space of continuous maps R -> R
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:49:15] and all sorts of weirder examples of vector spaces over the reals
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:50:13] (each of these sets coming equipped with the operations which make it a vector space of course)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:50:28] Cale: so the linear transforms would be arrows from R^2 to R^2, but is there anything between two distinct objects in the category?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:50:38] Cale: continuous maps R->R is a fun one.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:50:56] mjrosenb: There are plenty of linear maps R^n -> R^m in general
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:51:03] the proof that it is the same size as R was one of the ugliest proofs I ever wrote.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:51:31] (they correspond to n-by-m matrices, remember)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:51:52] mjrosenb: why? :P |RxR| = |R| trivially :p
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:52:13] ReinH: The set of all functions R -> R has greater cardinality than R
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:52:25] Cale: oh, linear maps, not linear transforms.  (I took linear algebra in 2005, I may be a bit of on the terminology, still remember the concepts though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:52:28] (it has cardinality 2^|R|)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:52:43] mjrosenb: nono, linear transformations are the same thing :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:53:17] Remember if V and W are vector spaces over F, then a linear transformation (or linear map)  T: V -> W is a function such that
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[09:53:20] Cale: hrmm, what is the thing that is represented by foo a vec = [a*x | x <- vec]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:53:42] for any u,v in V, we have T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:53:55] Cale: right, which is P(R)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:53:56] and for any a in F and v in V, we have T(a*v) = a*T(v)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:54:21] er, which is equal to |P(R)|
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:54:49] ReinH: So, the hard part is showing that if you restrict to just the continuous ones, then the cardinality is the same as that of the reals.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:54:51] Cale: but I said RxR, not R^R :p Maybe I misunderstood what mjrosenb was saying.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:55:01] Cale: ah.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:55:13] ReinH: I don't know what R x R has to do with it, but maybe you have some idea for the proof :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:01] mjrosenb: Our vectors here are just abstract things which have an addition and scalar multiplication defined on them, so they needn't actually be tuples of real numbers
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:56:16] Cale: uh, the cardinality is at least |R| because of const
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:18] (but in some cases of course they will be)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:32] ReinH: right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:56:41] Cale: and at most |R| because the set of real continuous functions injects into R^2
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:49] how?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:57:08] (it does, but that's not exactly *simple* :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	mjrosenb [09:57:16] is curious about that injection as well.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:57:40] Sorry, R^N
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:58:11] R^N could work
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	mjrosenb [09:58:31] is not convinced  R^N is easy.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:58:35] Cale: oh god I'm forgetting, something something rational points
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:58:45] Yeah, there you go!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:58:47] hand wave hand wave QED
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:59:05] Each continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on rational points
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[09:59:13] yeah those are the words :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:00:00] So you have an injection from continuous functions R -> R to all functions Q -> R
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:00:15] and then it comes down to showing the latter set of functions has cardinality |R|
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:00:17] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:00:22] (which you can do with general theorems)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:00:33] (and the countability of Q)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:00:34] where "trivial" means "I am aware of such a proof" ;)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:00:51] *mumble* crazy diagonals *mumble*
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:01:03] yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:01:03] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:01:43] How much work is left there is highly dependent on how much you know about cardinal numbers in general already.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:02:36] Cale: or how much you're allowed to use on the homework.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:02:55] We can form a (rather large) category whose objects are cardinal numbers, and whose arrows are injections between them.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:03:30] or any number of variations on that :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:04:24] Any ordinal number can be made a category based on its ordering, by the process I mentioned before.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:04:43] In particular, that gives you an example of a category for each natural number
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:05:14] Cale: which process?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:05:15] i.e. where the objects are the first n natural numbers {0,...,n-1} and there's exactly one arrow n -> m whenever n <= m, and none otherwise
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:05:22] Ah, I'll repeat it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:05:26] ahh.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:05:51] You can do this with any set S, and relation <= on S which is reflexive and transitive
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:05:52] no need, just many processes were discussed.  that little snippet was enough to figure it out.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:05:56] okay :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:07:26] So, in homotopy theory, groupoids show up very naturally as objects of study, because there you're interested in paths in topological spaces (If you don't know what topological spaces are in general, you can just think of subsets of R^n and get lots of nice examples of them that way)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:33] If S is some topological space, and x and y are points in S, then a path from x to y in S is defined as a continuous function [0,1] -> S (where [0,1] is the unit interval in the real numbers)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:08:34] Cale: oh right, posets require antisymmetry to avoid cycles
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:52] a continuous function f: [0,1] -> S such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:58] ReinH: right!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:09:51] Cale: is there some additional restriction on S other than 'subset', because with a general subset, 'continuous' doesn't make sense.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:10:00] mjrosenb: It still does make sense
2014-01-28 09:22:42	shachaf	[10:10:25] You can "collapse" a preorder into a poset of its cycles, which is roughly the same idea as the skeleton of a category.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:11:45] so if S = { n | n < 5 V n > 7 }, and x = 4, y = 8, what would a continuous function look like?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:12:03] shachaf: ah interesting
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:12:10] ah, well, there might not *be* such a path :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:12:50] mjrosenb: If for any x and y in S, we have a path from x to y, then S is called a path-connected space.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:13:22] Cale: gotcha.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:13:45] so no spaces that look like anti-swiss cheese.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:14:15] Anti-swiss-cheese spaces are okay as spaces, but they're not path connected, yeah.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:16:56] So, now we define an equivalence relation on paths from x to y, by saying that f,g : [0,1] -> S are equivalent when there is a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> S such that:
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:17:03] 1) H(0,x) = f(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:17:08] 2) H(1,x) = g(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:17:25] 3) H(t,0) = x for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:17:31] 3) H(t,1) = y for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:18:00] so this is defining a path between paths by defining a sheet that maps to the unit square?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:18:11] yeah, from the unit square
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:18:41] You can think of the t parameter as being like 'time', and H providing a sort of "animation" which starts with f and ends with g
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:18:42] yes, it can overlap itself.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:19:00] yeah, that is what I meant by path between paths.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:19:03] and where the endpoints stay fixed throughout
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:20:01] Given a topological space S, we can define a category where the objects are the points of S, and the arrows x -> y are the paths from x to y
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:20:05] up to equivalence
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:20:12] (i.e. equivalence classes of paths)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:21:30] For any point p in S, there is a constant path id_p : [0,1] -> S such that id_p(x) = p for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:22:00] (and we're really taking the identity arrow to be the equivalence class of paths containing that path)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:23:30] *nod*
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:23:31] For any path f from x to y and g from y to z, we can define a path g . f from x to z, which runs along f at double speed for values in [0,1/2] and then runs along g at double speed for values in [1/2,1]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:23:43] which would be the set of all loops that can be shrunk to a single point.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:23:54] and this turns out to be associative up to equivalence
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:24:23] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:24:31] that's a nice category
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:24:36] Cale: you are good at explaining things
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:24:41] pls to be writing a book
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:24:45] It's even nicer because every path also has an inverse
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:25:01] so it's a groupoid
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:25:05] yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:25:07] nice
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:25:14] Cale: but seriously please write a book
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:25:23] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:25:43] Cale: one of the things we taked to byorgey about was the need for some sort of "Category Theory for the Working Haskeller"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:26:16] I realize there's Category Theory for Computer Scientists but I want a treatment especially for Haskell
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:26:32] bot cat theory and abstract algebra, in fact
2014-01-28 09:22:42	shachaf	[10:26:42] But note that it's *not* associative without doing the equivalence classes thing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:26:43] I would be worried that people might read my book before Awodey's :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:26:58] Cale: heh, well lots of haskellers aren't mathematicians :p
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:27:19] Well, sure
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:27:27] But if you're studying category theory
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:27:43] Cale: so, if the space looks like a donut, would the equivalence class of closed loops that go around the hole once be another set of identities?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:27:51] I think it's enough of a distraction that you perhaps shouldn't be scared that what you're learning is mathematics.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:28:06] Cale: right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:28:26] Cale: yeah, maybe what I want is really "Applied Category Theory for Haskellers"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:28:58] mjrosenb: They'd be distinct from the identity/constant path, yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:29:36] good, making correct observations about new systems *usually* means I understand what's going on.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:29:48] mjrosenb: It turns out to be really tricky to prove by direct means that R^2 and R^3 are not homeomorphic, i.e. that there are not continuous bijections in both directions between them which are inverses of each other
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:30:11] But we can get a proof of that by poking a hole in each of them by removing one point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:30:55] and then noting that when we remove a point from R^3, we can still contract any loop to a constant path
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:31:25] but if we remove a point from R^2, then a loop which goes around the hole can no longer be continuously contracted to a point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:31:57] Cale: ok, I understand the second part of that, but I still don't believe the first part.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:32:11] You mean the part about R^3?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:32:25] about r^2 and r^3 not being homeomorphic
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:32:26] Or that it's hard to show they're not isomorphic as topological spaces?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:32:56] Or do you think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic? :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	shachaf	[10:32:58] You would still have to show that homeomorphism ought to preserve this property.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:33:03] yeah, you would
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:33:38] There's still a lot of additional work here which I'm skimming over because I'm not giving a full course on this right now :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:33:54] But I just wanted to give an example of something we can do with this
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:33:59] Cale: I think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:34:03] ah, okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:34:10] Well, this provides a proof that they aren't after all
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:34:19] Cale: I'll believe it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:34:58] So, in addition to this groupoid I mentioned
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:35:13] If you pick any one point and consider the loops starting and ending at that point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:35:17] You get a group
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:35:44] That's called the fundamental group of the pointed topological space (and the groupoid I mentioned is called the fundamental groupoid)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:37:01] okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:37:04] So, functors
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:37:21] Given two categories C and D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:37:30] a functor F: C -> D consists of two things
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:37:46] 1) A mapping sending each object X in C to an object FX in D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:38:02] 2) A mapping sending each arrow  a: X -> Y in C, to an arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:38:21] such that for any object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:38:42] and for any arrows a and b which compose, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:40:03] Note that if a: Y -> Z and b: X -> Y are composable arrows, then you get a diagram which looks like a triangle with X, Y, Z as vertices, and a, b, and (a.b) as sides
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:40:11] in other words, it maps identity arrows to identity arrows
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:40:29] and "commutative triangles to commutative triangles"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:40:37] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:40:41] (though I hadn't actually introduced what commutative triangles are)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:41:14] draw them with ascii art
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:41:46] .oO(a diagrams 1.0 library to draw commutativity diagrams)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:41:52] since they just added arrows (the visual kind)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:41:54] A commutative diagram in a category is a collection of objects and arrows such that composing the arrows along any two paths with the same starting and ending point will give you an equal result
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:42:29] mjrosenb: okay?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:42:41] So a functor is a kind of structure-preserving map between categories
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:43:04] sec, catching up.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:43:34] Cale: and of course diagrams are functors and now I've gone all cross-eyed
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:45:09] yes, diagrams are functors (usually from some category with finitely many objects and arrows), and commutative diagrams are functors from a preorder category
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:45:10] commutative triangle btw http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CommutativeTriangle_1000.gif
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[10:45:25] Cale: gotcha on all of this stuff, but I need to run plan some stuff for tomorrow.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:45:33] mjrosenb: okay, cool
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:45:44] mjrosenb: btw Awodey has a series of video lectures on youtube
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:45:48] cat theory lectures, that is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:45:50] they are very good
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:46:16] So, the fundamental group of a pointed topological space gives an example of a functor
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:46:39] From the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:46:59] (that's a very nontrivial example)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:47:50] (and of course, once we've defined a category of groupoids and functors between them, then the fundamental groupoid of a space gives us another functor)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:48:16] and of course functors between categories form... a category.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:48:28] Turning continuous maps between spaces into functors between their fundamental groupoids :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:49:11] (these are perhaps not the best things to give as baby's first functors, but they're among the most remarkable examples in my mind)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:49:28] and now we can talk about the yoneda lemma :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:49:33] LOL
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:49:37] before he has to go
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:49:41] real quick
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:49:44] hahah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:55:23] Cale: and then we can talk about representable functors
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:55:36] Cale: and finally we can write a memoization library
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[10:56:06] this is of course the obvious way to derive momoization... if you are edwardk.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:58:45] I realise that's a typo, but I really want there to be an anime in which momoization is a thing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:02:33] Oh, I see how he's using them, okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:02:55] Representable profunctors
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:03:57] oh, and ordinary functors as well, okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[11:04:16] heh
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[11:04:46] Cale: to write a memoization library you must first derive the yoneda embedding. Or something.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:04:59] Well, it's sort of cheesy
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:05:24] The Yoneda stuff is all very flattened out when you try to squish it into Haskell
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:05:44] Remarkably, still resulting in something useful somehow!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[11:05:46] Cale: endofunctors make things a bit simpler eh?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[11:05:48] heh
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:06:10] But it loses most of its original point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[11:06:14] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:33] oh, yall are still going
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:35] good good
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	joneshf-laptop [11:17:51] has a new favorite channel
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[11:37:25] look at all these words 0_0
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[11:47:52] wow   many word   very discussion   such category
2014-01-28 09:22:42	acowley	[12:25:47] Wow, Cale you really do a great job with these things.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	acowley	[12:26:00] You could provide commentary for Awodey's videos!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[12:56:08] ReinH: I have a tendency to not watch things (on youtube, or otherwise)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[12:57:49] mjrosenb: Awodey's lectures are definitely worth watching :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[12:58:04] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmodCApZwk
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[13:00:04] In 4-5 hours, he goes over quite a significant amount of material in a pretty coherent way. Probably you'd also want to stop at some points and read some stuff too though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	mjrosenb	[13:32:00] Cale: perhaps this weekend.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[14:54:33] A lot of people recommend me Awodey's book and lectures but I just find his book extremely hard to graps, for some reason :( I only got luck after I read Pierce's book on CT
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[15:02:43] notdan: try catsters
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[15:04:35] Yeah I saw them; pretty much the same, unfortunately. But I got better at CT since I watched the Awodey's lectures, so I am giving the casters another shot
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[15:04:57] i watched catsters about 5 times before the stuff became intuitive
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[15:05:04] but catsters is fun, so
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[15:05:31] yeah I agree
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[01:43:05] Hi, can someone please check my proof that `Maybe` is a non-representable functor? http://covariant.me/stuff/tmp/nonrep.html
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[01:43:32] It looks sound to me, but I just started digging into that topic so there is a high chance I am missing something
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tomprince	[01:59:27] notdan: The typesetting of 'fmap' (there appears to almost be a space: 'f map') makes it a bit confusing to parse.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:00:34] I am sorry, I am typesetting it with \mathord
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:00:39] I wonder if there is a better solution
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:01:00] also the slight space between M and 'aybe'. annoying
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:02:16] Also, you seem to have swapped eta and eta^-1
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:03:12] It would be clearer if you write u = eta^-1_A (id_A) rather than u ~ id_A
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:04:52] So that you get for instance, that if eta^-1_A (id_A) = Nothing, then for any g: A -> B,  eta^-1_A g = eta^-1_A (g . id_A) = fmap g (eta^-1_A (id_A)) = fmap g Nothing = Nothing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:05:36] thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:05:43] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:06:16] it should be eta^-1_B (g), though?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:06:22] oh, oops, yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:06:27] In one case there :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:06:52] yeah, so every 'g' corresponds to Nothing, meaning that no function corresponds to 'Just'
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:07:02] so it's not a bijection
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:07:46] right, or you can explicitly give one which doesn't by using the supposedly inverse map, and show that Nothing = Just x for some x.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:09:01] Not sure what do you mean, sorry. Explicitly give = "... there exists g that corresponds to Just x"?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[02:09:20] ugg, silly hom functors...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[02:09:34] Hom(a, f) = f_* = f o -    right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:10:05] yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:10:10] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[02:10:24] I always get those mixed up. Thanks :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:10:44] notdan: Well, eta_B (Just x) will be such a function
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:11:16] So on the one hand we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Just x
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:11:34] and on the other hand, we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Nothing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:11:35] Aaah, sorry, messed up explicitly vs implicitly here
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:11:41] Makes sense; thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:26:07] I still don't grasp what are representable functors good for
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:26:15] I read http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+functor#examples but I don't understand why I should care
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:30:03] notdan: Suppose that C is a Cartesian closed category with coproducts. Show that there is a natural isomorphism: (A x B) + (A x C) ~= A x (B + C).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:31:09] (Try doing this from first principles, and then try doing it using Yoneda)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:32:44] The key thing is that there are all kinds of nice relationships between Hom and various other constructions.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	BullSherd	[02:32:49] Wow, Google is making really strange things http://goo.gl/YEkaMA
2014-01-28 09:22:42	BullSherd	[02:32:51] funny haha xD
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:33:02] spam link
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:36:32] doing it using Yoneda == show that their Hom-sets are equivalent?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:36:48] yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:37:17] i.e. show that Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:43:12] I am sorry, I am not sure how to do that. I assume I have to dissect Hom(A x (B+C),X) into Hom(A,X) and Hom(B+C,X), but I am not sure how
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[02:43:41] Well, we have an isomorphism Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom(B + C, X^A)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[02:43:58] ah, I forgot about the exponentials
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[06:01:45] How do cardinal numbers relate to limits?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[06:01:45] I figure both are obtained from many objects by a sort of orthogonal process, where we gather everything together and find an encompassing object.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tomprince	[06:06:00] cardinals are limits in the partial order on the ordinals. (They are a particular type of limit ordinal).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:32:24] Cale: C is a.k.a. bicartesian closed in the above right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:33:09] sure, if you like
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:33:49] Cale: and we can't just use the distribution of products over coproducts to show the above?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:34:04] Well, heh, if you assume it, that's rather trivial
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:34:21] Cale: ah, I thought it was axiomatic.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:34:25] but obv not
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:37:18] Cale: ah this is trying to show that the yoneda functor preserves isomorphisms right? Er, not preserves.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:37:28] some word that means the opposite of preserves.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:38:09] It's just serving as a useful tool to show that the isomorphisms already had to be there
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:38:37] e.g. if Ff : FA -> FB is an iso then f : A -> B is an iso
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:38:47] Yeah, where F = y here
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:38:52] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:39:12] Oh. Reflects. Thanks google.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:39:35] Well, and the special thing about y is that even if the arrow yA -> yB we constructed isn't explicitly of the form yf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:40:10] we know that there must be such an f
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:40:22] ah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:40:57] Cale: I can't see the proof of the above. But I can sort of view it dimly, as if from a great distance.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:41:24] (The Yoneda embedding is a bijection on hom sets)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[07:41:35] right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:42:35] So, we almost got there, if you'd like to see the rest of the steps -- really you'd have to show all of these are natural isomorphisms, but that's just a lot of tedious, but ultimately easy checking
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:42:48] So, starting from Hom(A x (B + C), X)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:43:04] this is isomorphic to Hom(B + C, X^A) (currying)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:43:27] and that's isomorphic to  Hom(B, X^A) x Hom(C, X^A)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:44:04] and then that's isomorphic to Hom(A x B, X) x Hom(A x C, X)  (uncurrying each of them)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:44:25] and then lastly we get to Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:45:53] So composing together that chain of isomorphisms (or rather the corresponding natural transformations in X) gets us an isomorphism: y (A x (B + C)) -> y ((A x B) + (A x C))
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[07:46:25] and then the Yoneda lemma tells us that there must really have been an isomorphism (A x (B + C)) -> ((A x B) + (A x C)) in the first place.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[07:52:13] ~the yoneeeeeda lemma~
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[07:52:49] that was the second to last lecture in Awodey's lectures, i think?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[07:53:02] i think its also the subject of the talk Reasoning Isomorphically
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[07:55:06] aha, reason, not reasoning
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur_	[07:55:11] http://vimeo.com/16754927
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:06:32] Awodey also does this in his book
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[08:07:32] augur_: thanks for the link
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[08:07:33] Cale: reading
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[08:07:41] Cale: haven't gotten through the awodey book yet
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[08:08:46] Cale: and that last step is because of what we talked about before, that y reflects isos
2014-01-28 09:22:42	ReinH	[08:08:55] ok cool
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[21:07:48] Yay proved that respectful endofunctor is indeed a monad
2014-01-28 09:22:42	notdan	[21:08:28] proving the monadic laws in terms of 'join' and 'return' was fun, but def more harder than proving the usual (>=>) and return laws
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[09:44:15] If someone says F -| G : C -> D is an adjunction
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[09:44:24] That means F : C -> D as a functor and G goes the other way, right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:55:49] Probably best to be careful about that. It's usually not hard to figure out what's meant in context.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:22] That would be a reasonable convention though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:56:47] Though maybe it's specifying the type of G :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:57:10] (at the same time as saying that F is left adjoint to it)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[10:03:17] I guess I should ask Edwardk: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-4.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Co.html
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:07:00] Well, it doesn't matter which is C and D there, because those variables don't occur anywhere else
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[10:07:48] hm
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[10:07:52] I suppose your reasoning is sound
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[10:08:07] But still good to check if there's a general convention to this kind of thing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:12] ah, and his convention can be inferred from the next line
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:30] He says that GF is a monad on D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:08:41] (and that GMF is too)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	tac	[10:08:43] ah, good point.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	tac [10:08:50] should take a nap instead of asking one-off questions on IRC
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:35:28] Did anyone here read Lawveres introductory book "Conceptual mathematics"? Opinions on it? I'm reading it currently, and I find it curious how it's a high school book for 49 pages and then jumps 500% in demand.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:39:59] NickKidman: I've taken a quick look at it, and recommended it to a mathematics interested non-mathematician friend of mine
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:41:07] Wasn't the jump a little like the jump you usually see after the "introduction to set theory" chapter you see in the beginning of a lot of mathematics textbooks :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:44:00] noteventime: No, I mean it really gets suddently harder there. There he introduces the theorem-proof style simulatnously with the section/lifting/retraction concept
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:44:38] I don't think it'll be an easy read for a non-mathematician, although I love the philosophical approach he makes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:44:55] I've read it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:45:01] I think it's typical of Lawvere, the style I mean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:45:45] It's okay, it's really weird though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:45:51] why
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:46:13] If you're used to ordinary mathematics, the perspective he has is quite different :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:47:33] what do you mean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:49:39] Well, it makes sense once you know what he's doing, he's developing a categorical presentation of a theory of sets. But for someone who is already quite familiar with ZFC set theory, say, it's a radically different approach.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:50:11] What's the relation between Conceptual Mathematics and Sets for Mathematics btw
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:50:16] I never quite figured that out
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:50:17] oh
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:50:28] Right, I was thinking of Sets for Mathematics :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:50:42] Because of the remarks that it was like a highschool book :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:50:46] haha
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:50:53] Perhaps conceptual mathematics is like that too!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:51:04] Cale: Well, yes, I think the description still fits
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[22:51:25] Cale: The way I remember it they were quite similar, though I think conceptual mathematics is more basic
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:51:55] Oh, right, yes, I haven't read Conceptual Mathematics, but I have flipped through it before
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:52:37] anyway, something else: A,B in a category, f:A->B a map. I am thinking about the element/global element perspective which I find conceptually interesting. If f is an A-element of B, then I think of A being embedded in B, right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:52:37] I mean if S^2 is the sphere then smooth e: S^2->R^3 embed that ballsurface in R^3, I can make a mental image and I don't even bother about intersections (the fact that the thing might be deformed and different points of S^2 map to the same spot in R^3).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:52:37] But then if I consider space R^3 and a physical field, a section \psi in C^2 say, then I have
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:52:37] \psi: R^3->C^2
2014-01-28 09:22:42	NickKidman	[22:52:38] Can I think of this as R^3 embedded in C^2 somehow?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:55:05] Normally you don't use the word "embedding" unless it's injective.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:56:24] (and in some cases, you'd want to be more careful still, in topological settings, it's usual to say that an embedding f: X -> Y is a continuous map which induces a homeomorphism X -> f(X)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:56:27] )
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[22:57:34] But yeah, you can think of any map X -> Y as squishing a copy of X and fitting it into Y somehow (in general it may not be injective)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[10:30:26] here's a fun game:
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[10:31:01] google "cftwm mac lane", then try to figure out what cftwm is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[10:32:09] it's like the acronym is not in the vicinity of the book title
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:39:14] huh?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:40:20] oh, if you're trying to guess it just from google results?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:40:59] hah, I get a log from #haskell in 2007 which reveals it, as the last result
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:41:08] while searching with: cftwm maclane
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:41:18] haskell-2007-03-17
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:41:19] tuukka.iki.fi/tmp/haskell-2007-03-17‎
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[10:41:19] Mar 17, 2007 - in MacLane's Category Theory for the Working Mathematician. ... <merus>, +ACTION wants a university that actually has CFTWM in its library.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	joneshf-laptop	[11:06:57] yeah :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[22:45:48] categorists!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[22:46:23] is there any nice relationship between the reader monad, CTicly, and the representable functors, aside from reader being a special case?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[22:46:39] that is to say, are there nice monadic properties related to yoneda?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[00:07:01] augur: Umm, isn't Reader A exactly Hom(A, -)?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[00:07:55] noteventime: yes, i was wondering if there were interactions between the moadicity of reader, and the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[00:08:52] Though I guess it's really the internal Hom
2014-01-28 09:22:42	noteventime	[00:09:12] So it's Encriched-representable
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:41:19] augur: what do you mean by "the monadicity of reader"?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:41:28] johnw: reader is a monad!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:42:50] I don't see what monads have to do with yoneda though
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:43:23] johnw: they dont, but there might be interesting interactions, hence my question
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:43:38] i mean, reader is just the yoneda embedding, so
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:44:02] reader is just the yoneda embedding of what exactly?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:44:34] reader is a -> r, aka Hom(a,-), while yoneda is Nat(Hom(a,-),f)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:45:01] (speaking of course about covariant Yoneda only)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:45:01] no
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:45:11] the yoneda embedding is yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:45:22] y being the embedding
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:45:42] Reader is just y specialized to the category of sets
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:46:21] I don't follow.  In Haskell isn't the yoneda embedding Yoneda f a = forall r. Functor f => (a -> r) -> f r.  How does that fit with yX = Hom(X,-)?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:46:29] no
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:46:32] thats the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:46:44] the lemma is used to prove that y is an embedding
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:47:01] more accurately
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:47:03] ah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:47:18] in nlab is says the embedding is Y : C -> [C^op, Set]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:47:23] interesting
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:47:33] That is the correct type
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:47:34] the yoneda lemma is the iso   forall a f. Functor f => f a ~ (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:47:48] at least, the contravariant yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:47:54] which is my favorite
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:47:54] yX = Hom(X,-), here, Hom(X,-) is a functor C^op -> Set
2014-01-28 09:22:42	johnw	[08:47:55] hi Cale!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:48:10] Hom(X,Y) is a set
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:48:15] johnw: yes, y : C -> [C^op,Set]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:48:22] y sets X in C to Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:48:27] hence, yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:49:02] er, wait
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:49:04] or in this case i guess we probably want C^op -> [C,Set] since its contravariant
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:49:13] We've messed it up a bit, yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:49:25] Hom(-,X) is the right way around :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:49:36] Cale: shush, im using contra-y :|
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:49:43] its much nicer computationally!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:50:00] i dont know how co-y is supposed to be interpreted
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:51:50] Well, we have for each a: U -> V, a map Hom(a,X): Hom(V,X) -> Hom(U,X) given by precomposition with a.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:52:26] yes yes but i mean, i dont know what the haskell type is that corresponds to it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:52:36] everything i try to come up with is just bonkers
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:53:11] like, bonkers in the "i dont know if thats constructively provable" bonkers
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:53:15] newtype To b a = MkTo (a -> b)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:53:30] instance Cofunctor (To b) where
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:54:07] i take it you're using Cofunctor here to mean contravariant functor?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:54:08]   cofmap f (MkTo g) = MkTo (g . f)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:54:12] yep
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:54:16] how weird.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:54:53] I just need to swap the arguments of (->) so I can make an instance
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:54:59] ya
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:55:42] but i mean, the lemma type is like.. what   forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a ~ (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r) ???
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[08:55:53] that doesnt make sense
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:58:57] Well, it says for any object X : Hask, and functor F: Set^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of sets Hom(yX, F) ~= FX
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[08:59:16] so, to flatten that out, let's pretend Set = Hask
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:00:08] For any object X : Hask, and functor F: Hask^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of Haskell types Hom(yX, F) ~= F X
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:00:31] and then yX : To X
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:00:34] er
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:00:38] yX = To X
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:01:10] and Hom(To X, F) -- this Hom is in the category of natural transformations, so let's flatten that into a polymorphic function
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:01:16] Hom(yX,F) = forall r. To X r -> F r  =  forall r. (r -> X) -> F r
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:01:21] (forall a. To X a -> F a)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:01:53] yep
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:02:01] this is why i find it so alien, because wtf is the definition here
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:02:02] i mean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:02:05] hm?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:02:25] lemma :: Cofunctor f => f a -> (r -> a) -> f r
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:02:49] er, Functor f, no Cofunctor
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:02:55] or is it a cofucntor?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:03:01] errrrr
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:05] maybe thats why im caught
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:03:05] it is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:10] its a Cofunctor?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:30] ok so thats not a problem then
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:35] lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:03:39] also, you've messed up all the vars
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:51] no i havent, not in that direction!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:03:58] the foralls can scope high
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:04:12] forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a -> (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:04:18] thats just the fwd dir of the lemma
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:04:23] lemma :: forall f. (Cofunctor f) => forall a. (forall r. (r -> a) -> F r) -> F a
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:04:31] thats the bwd dir!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:04:34] and that inverse of that
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:04:40] the inverse is what i wrote :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:05:04] yeah, you left off the higher-rankness before
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:05:12] that's important
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:05:19] yeah but for the fwd direction the higher-rankness is irrelevant
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:05:37] a -> forall b. ...  == forall b. a -> ...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:05:37] (also, I mean f not F)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cale	[09:05:43] yeah, okay
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:05:57] but yeah, so lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:05:58] thats nice
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:07:38] and the bwd direction is ($id) as usual
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:07:52] thats really gorgeous
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:08:17] i mean, the fwd dir of contra-yoneda is just flip fmap
2014-01-28 09:22:42	augur	[09:08:32] so its really nice that fwd co-yoneda is flip cofmap

2014-01-28 12:39:00	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:37:42] okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:38:25] So, let's see some examples
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:38:59] mjrosenb: I don't know what your mathematical background is like, but every branch of mathematics has at least one, if not many rich examples to offer
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:40:05] The idea being that every branch of mathematics is interested in studying some class of objects along with structure-preserving mappings of some sort between those objects, and generally those mappings can be composed in an associative fashion
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:40:06] Cale: pretty sure I took something from every sub-field of math that was offered while I was an undergrad.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:40:17] ah, cool, okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:40:34] So, you have a category of vector spaces and linear transformations between them
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:40:43] and a category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:40:55] and a category of topological spaces and continuous maps
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:41:11] a category of graphs and graph homomorphisms (of various sorts)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:41:18] a category of metric spaces and contraction mappings
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:42:40] Every monoid provides an example of a category in the way I mentioned already: you can build a category with a single object, and take the arrows from that object to itself to be the elements of the monoid, and the composition of arrows to be the monoid multiplication.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:42:58] ahh, topology, there was a conflict when that was offered :-(
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:43:15] anyhow, linear algebra was fun, how about an example from that?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:43:40] Yeah, so given any field F, there's a category whose objects are vector spaces over F
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:44:21] and whose arrows are linear transformations between the vector spaces
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:44:40] Composing linear transformations gives us a linear transformation
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:44:51] (i.e. composing them as functions)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:45:20] and linear transforms are associative.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:45:21] and for every vector space there is an identity linear transformation
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:45:25] and yeah, composition is associative
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:45:36] and so that defines a category
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:45:51] As a weirder example
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:46:09] Let S be any set, and let <= be any reflexive, transitive relation on S
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:46:23] mjrosenb: I mentioned that one in #haskell too: The category Mat(F) is the category of matrices over some field F :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:46:33] i.e. for all x in S, we have x <= x, and for any x, y, z in S, whenever x <= y and y <= z, we have x <= z
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:46:43] Then we can make a category whose objects are the elements of S
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:46:57] and where there is exactly one arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:47:00] and no arrow otherwise
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:47:23] (btw, such a relation is called a preorder)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:47:33] This is a poset category iinm
2014-01-28 12:39:00	copumpkin	[09:47:40] Cale: like what I do on amazon, right?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:47:47] Cale: so in the first example, the number of elements in the vector is fixed, and the number of objects in the category is dependent on the number of elements in F?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:47:52] Which has a lot of objects and relatively few arrows
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:47:52] Well, it's a poset category if the preorder happens to be a poset
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:48:13] Compared to a monoid or group, which has a lot of arrows and relatively few objects (in fact, only one).
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:48:23] mjrosenb: The objects in the category of vector spaces are themselves entire vector spaces
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:48:25] Cale: righto
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:48:36] For example, if we pick F to be the real numbers
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:48:44] Cale: oh um... oh.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:48:46] Then R^n for each n will be an object of the category
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:48:59] As will the space of continuous maps R -> R
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:49:15] and all sorts of weirder examples of vector spaces over the reals
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:50:13] (each of these sets coming equipped with the operations which make it a vector space of course)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:50:28] Cale: so the linear transforms would be arrows from R^2 to R^2, but is there anything between two distinct objects in the category?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:50:38] Cale: continuous maps R->R is a fun one.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:50:56] mjrosenb: There are plenty of linear maps R^n -> R^m in general
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:51:03] the proof that it is the same size as R was one of the ugliest proofs I ever wrote.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:51:31] (they correspond to n-by-m matrices, remember)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:51:52] mjrosenb: why? :P |RxR| = |R| trivially :p
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:52:13] ReinH: The set of all functions R -> R has greater cardinality than R
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:52:25] Cale: oh, linear maps, not linear transforms.  (I took linear algebra in 2005, I may be a bit of on the terminology, still remember the concepts though.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:52:28] (it has cardinality 2^|R|)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:52:43] mjrosenb: nono, linear transformations are the same thing :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:53:17] Remember if V and W are vector spaces over F, then a linear transformation (or linear map)  T: V -> W is a function such that
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[09:53:20] Cale: hrmm, what is the thing that is represented by foo a vec = [a*x | x <- vec]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:53:42] for any u,v in V, we have T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:53:55] Cale: right, which is P(R)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:53:56] and for any a in F and v in V, we have T(a*v) = a*T(v)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:54:21] er, which is equal to |P(R)|
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:54:49] ReinH: So, the hard part is showing that if you restrict to just the continuous ones, then the cardinality is the same as that of the reals.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:54:51] Cale: but I said RxR, not R^R :p Maybe I misunderstood what mjrosenb was saying.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:55:01] Cale: ah.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:55:13] ReinH: I don't know what R x R has to do with it, but maybe you have some idea for the proof :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:01] mjrosenb: Our vectors here are just abstract things which have an addition and scalar multiplication defined on them, so they needn't actually be tuples of real numbers
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:56:16] Cale: uh, the cardinality is at least |R| because of const
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:18] (but in some cases of course they will be)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:32] ReinH: right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:56:41] Cale: and at most |R| because the set of real continuous functions injects into R^2
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:49] how?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:57:08] (it does, but that's not exactly *simple* :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	mjrosenb [09:57:16] is curious about that injection as well.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:57:40] Sorry, R^N
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:58:11] R^N could work
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	mjrosenb [09:58:31] is not convinced  R^N is easy.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:58:35] Cale: oh god I'm forgetting, something something rational points
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:58:45] Yeah, there you go!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:58:47] hand wave hand wave QED
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:59:05] Each continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on rational points
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[09:59:13] yeah those are the words :D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:00:00] So you have an injection from continuous functions R -> R to all functions Q -> R
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:00:15] and then it comes down to showing the latter set of functions has cardinality |R|
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:00:17] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:00:22] (which you can do with general theorems)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:00:33] (and the countability of Q)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:00:34] where "trivial" means "I am aware of such a proof" ;)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:00:51] *mumble* crazy diagonals *mumble*
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:01:03] yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:01:03] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:01:43] How much work is left there is highly dependent on how much you know about cardinal numbers in general already.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:02:36] Cale: or how much you're allowed to use on the homework.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:02:55] We can form a (rather large) category whose objects are cardinal numbers, and whose arrows are injections between them.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:03:30] or any number of variations on that :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:04:24] Any ordinal number can be made a category based on its ordering, by the process I mentioned before.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:04:43] In particular, that gives you an example of a category for each natural number
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:05:14] Cale: which process?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:05:15] i.e. where the objects are the first n natural numbers {0,...,n-1} and there's exactly one arrow n -> m whenever n <= m, and none otherwise
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:05:22] Ah, I'll repeat it
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:05:26] ahh.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:05:51] You can do this with any set S, and relation <= on S which is reflexive and transitive
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:05:52] no need, just many processes were discussed.  that little snippet was enough to figure it out.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:05:56] okay :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:07:26] So, in homotopy theory, groupoids show up very naturally as objects of study, because there you're interested in paths in topological spaces (If you don't know what topological spaces are in general, you can just think of subsets of R^n and get lots of nice examples of them that way)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:33] If S is some topological space, and x and y are points in S, then a path from x to y in S is defined as a continuous function [0,1] -> S (where [0,1] is the unit interval in the real numbers)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:08:34] Cale: oh right, posets require antisymmetry to avoid cycles
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:52] a continuous function f: [0,1] -> S such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:58] ReinH: right!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:09:51] Cale: is there some additional restriction on S other than 'subset', because with a general subset, 'continuous' doesn't make sense.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:10:00] mjrosenb: It still does make sense
2014-01-28 12:39:00	shachaf	[10:10:25] You can "collapse" a preorder into a poset of its cycles, which is roughly the same idea as the skeleton of a category.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:11:45] so if S = { n | n < 5 V n > 7 }, and x = 4, y = 8, what would a continuous function look like?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:12:03] shachaf: ah interesting
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:12:10] ah, well, there might not *be* such a path :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:12:50] mjrosenb: If for any x and y in S, we have a path from x to y, then S is called a path-connected space.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:13:22] Cale: gotcha.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:13:45] so no spaces that look like anti-swiss cheese.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:14:15] Anti-swiss-cheese spaces are okay as spaces, but they're not path connected, yeah.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:16:56] So, now we define an equivalence relation on paths from x to y, by saying that f,g : [0,1] -> S are equivalent when there is a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> S such that:
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:17:03] 1) H(0,x) = f(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:17:08] 2) H(1,x) = g(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:17:25] 3) H(t,0) = x for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:17:31] 3) H(t,1) = y for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:18:00] so this is defining a path between paths by defining a sheet that maps to the unit square?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:18:11] yeah, from the unit square
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:18:41] You can think of the t parameter as being like 'time', and H providing a sort of "animation" which starts with f and ends with g
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:18:42] yes, it can overlap itself.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:19:00] yeah, that is what I meant by path between paths.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:19:03] and where the endpoints stay fixed throughout
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:20:01] Given a topological space S, we can define a category where the objects are the points of S, and the arrows x -> y are the paths from x to y
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:20:05] up to equivalence
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:20:12] (i.e. equivalence classes of paths)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:21:30] For any point p in S, there is a constant path id_p : [0,1] -> S such that id_p(x) = p for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:22:00] (and we're really taking the identity arrow to be the equivalence class of paths containing that path)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:23:30] *nod*
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:23:31] For any path f from x to y and g from y to z, we can define a path g . f from x to z, which runs along f at double speed for values in [0,1/2] and then runs along g at double speed for values in [1/2,1]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:23:43] which would be the set of all loops that can be shrunk to a single point.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:23:54] and this turns out to be associative up to equivalence
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:24:23] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:24:31] that's a nice category
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:24:36] Cale: you are good at explaining things
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:24:41] pls to be writing a book
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:24:45] It's even nicer because every path also has an inverse
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:25:01] so it's a groupoid
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:25:05] yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:25:07] nice
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:25:14] Cale: but seriously please write a book
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:25:23] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:25:43] Cale: one of the things we taked to byorgey about was the need for some sort of "Category Theory for the Working Haskeller"
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:26:16] I realize there's Category Theory for Computer Scientists but I want a treatment especially for Haskell
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:26:32] bot cat theory and abstract algebra, in fact
2014-01-28 12:39:00	shachaf	[10:26:42] But note that it's *not* associative without doing the equivalence classes thing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:26:43] I would be worried that people might read my book before Awodey's :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:26:58] Cale: heh, well lots of haskellers aren't mathematicians :p
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:27:19] Well, sure
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:27:27] But if you're studying category theory
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:27:43] Cale: so, if the space looks like a donut, would the equivalence class of closed loops that go around the hole once be another set of identities?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:27:51] I think it's enough of a distraction that you perhaps shouldn't be scared that what you're learning is mathematics.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:28:06] Cale: right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:28:26] Cale: yeah, maybe what I want is really "Applied Category Theory for Haskellers"
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:28:58] mjrosenb: They'd be distinct from the identity/constant path, yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:29:36] good, making correct observations about new systems *usually* means I understand what's going on.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:29:48] mjrosenb: It turns out to be really tricky to prove by direct means that R^2 and R^3 are not homeomorphic, i.e. that there are not continuous bijections in both directions between them which are inverses of each other
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:30:11] But we can get a proof of that by poking a hole in each of them by removing one point
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:30:55] and then noting that when we remove a point from R^3, we can still contract any loop to a constant path
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:31:25] but if we remove a point from R^2, then a loop which goes around the hole can no longer be continuously contracted to a point
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:31:57] Cale: ok, I understand the second part of that, but I still don't believe the first part.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:32:11] You mean the part about R^3?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:32:25] about r^2 and r^3 not being homeomorphic
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:32:26] Or that it's hard to show they're not isomorphic as topological spaces?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:32:56] Or do you think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic? :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	shachaf	[10:32:58] You would still have to show that homeomorphism ought to preserve this property.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:33:03] yeah, you would
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:33:38] There's still a lot of additional work here which I'm skimming over because I'm not giving a full course on this right now :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:33:54] But I just wanted to give an example of something we can do with this
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:33:59] Cale: I think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:34:03] ah, okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:34:10] Well, this provides a proof that they aren't after all
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:34:19] Cale: I'll believe it
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:34:58] So, in addition to this groupoid I mentioned
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:35:13] If you pick any one point and consider the loops starting and ending at that point
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:35:17] You get a group
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:35:44] That's called the fundamental group of the pointed topological space (and the groupoid I mentioned is called the fundamental groupoid)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:37:01] okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:37:04] So, functors
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:37:21] Given two categories C and D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:37:30] a functor F: C -> D consists of two things
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:37:46] 1) A mapping sending each object X in C to an object FX in D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:38:02] 2) A mapping sending each arrow  a: X -> Y in C, to an arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:38:21] such that for any object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:38:42] and for any arrows a and b which compose, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:40:03] Note that if a: Y -> Z and b: X -> Y are composable arrows, then you get a diagram which looks like a triangle with X, Y, Z as vertices, and a, b, and (a.b) as sides
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:40:11] in other words, it maps identity arrows to identity arrows
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:40:29] and "commutative triangles to commutative triangles"
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:40:37] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:40:41] (though I hadn't actually introduced what commutative triangles are)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:41:14] draw them with ascii art
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:41:46] .oO(a diagrams 1.0 library to draw commutativity diagrams)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:41:52] since they just added arrows (the visual kind)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:41:54] A commutative diagram in a category is a collection of objects and arrows such that composing the arrows along any two paths with the same starting and ending point will give you an equal result
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:42:29] mjrosenb: okay?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:42:41] So a functor is a kind of structure-preserving map between categories
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:43:04] sec, catching up.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:43:34] Cale: and of course diagrams are functors and now I've gone all cross-eyed
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:45:09] yes, diagrams are functors (usually from some category with finitely many objects and arrows), and commutative diagrams are functors from a preorder category
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:45:10] commutative triangle btw http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CommutativeTriangle_1000.gif
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[10:45:25] Cale: gotcha on all of this stuff, but I need to run plan some stuff for tomorrow.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:45:33] mjrosenb: okay, cool
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:45:44] mjrosenb: btw Awodey has a series of video lectures on youtube
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:45:48] cat theory lectures, that is
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:45:50] they are very good
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:46:16] So, the fundamental group of a pointed topological space gives an example of a functor
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:46:39] From the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:46:59] (that's a very nontrivial example)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:47:50] (and of course, once we've defined a category of groupoids and functors between them, then the fundamental groupoid of a space gives us another functor)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:48:16] and of course functors between categories form... a category.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:48:28] Turning continuous maps between spaces into functors between their fundamental groupoids :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:49:11] (these are perhaps not the best things to give as baby's first functors, but they're among the most remarkable examples in my mind)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:49:28] and now we can talk about the yoneda lemma :D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:49:33] LOL
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:49:37] before he has to go
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:49:41] real quick
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:49:44] hahah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:55:23] Cale: and then we can talk about representable functors
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:55:36] Cale: and finally we can write a memoization library
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[10:56:06] this is of course the obvious way to derive momoization... if you are edwardk.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:58:45] I realise that's a typo, but I really want there to be an anime in which momoization is a thing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:02:33] Oh, I see how he's using them, okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:02:55] Representable profunctors
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:03:57] oh, and ordinary functors as well, okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[11:04:16] heh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[11:04:46] Cale: to write a memoization library you must first derive the yoneda embedding. Or something.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:04:59] Well, it's sort of cheesy
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:05:24] The Yoneda stuff is all very flattened out when you try to squish it into Haskell
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:05:44] Remarkably, still resulting in something useful somehow!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[11:05:46] Cale: endofunctors make things a bit simpler eh?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[11:05:48] heh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:06:10] But it loses most of its original point
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[11:06:14] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:33] oh, yall are still going
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:35] good good
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	joneshf-laptop [11:17:51] has a new favorite channel
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[11:37:25] look at all these words 0_0
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[11:47:52] wow   many word   very discussion   such category
2014-01-28 12:39:00	acowley	[12:25:47] Wow, Cale you really do a great job with these things.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	acowley	[12:26:00] You could provide commentary for Awodey's videos!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[12:56:08] ReinH: I have a tendency to not watch things (on youtube, or otherwise)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[12:57:49] mjrosenb: Awodey's lectures are definitely worth watching :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[12:58:04] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmodCApZwk
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[13:00:04] In 4-5 hours, he goes over quite a significant amount of material in a pretty coherent way. Probably you'd also want to stop at some points and read some stuff too though.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	mjrosenb	[13:32:00] Cale: perhaps this weekend.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[14:54:33] A lot of people recommend me Awodey's book and lectures but I just find his book extremely hard to graps, for some reason :( I only got luck after I read Pierce's book on CT
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[15:02:43] notdan: try catsters
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[15:04:35] Yeah I saw them; pretty much the same, unfortunately. But I got better at CT since I watched the Awodey's lectures, so I am giving the casters another shot
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[15:04:57] i watched catsters about 5 times before the stuff became intuitive
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[15:05:04] but catsters is fun, so
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[15:05:31] yeah I agree
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[01:43:05] Hi, can someone please check my proof that `Maybe` is a non-representable functor? http://covariant.me/stuff/tmp/nonrep.html
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[01:43:32] It looks sound to me, but I just started digging into that topic so there is a high chance I am missing something
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tomprince	[01:59:27] notdan: The typesetting of 'fmap' (there appears to almost be a space: 'f map') makes it a bit confusing to parse.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:00:34] I am sorry, I am typesetting it with \mathord
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:00:39] I wonder if there is a better solution
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:01:00] also the slight space between M and 'aybe'. annoying
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:02:16] Also, you seem to have swapped eta and eta^-1
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:03:12] It would be clearer if you write u = eta^-1_A (id_A) rather than u ~ id_A
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:04:52] So that you get for instance, that if eta^-1_A (id_A) = Nothing, then for any g: A -> B,  eta^-1_A g = eta^-1_A (g . id_A) = fmap g (eta^-1_A (id_A)) = fmap g Nothing = Nothing
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:05:36] thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:05:43] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:06:16] it should be eta^-1_B (g), though?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:06:22] oh, oops, yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:06:27] In one case there :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:06:52] yeah, so every 'g' corresponds to Nothing, meaning that no function corresponds to 'Just'
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:07:02] so it's not a bijection
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:07:46] right, or you can explicitly give one which doesn't by using the supposedly inverse map, and show that Nothing = Just x for some x.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:09:01] Not sure what do you mean, sorry. Explicitly give = "... there exists g that corresponds to Just x"?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[02:09:20] ugg, silly hom functors...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[02:09:34] Hom(a, f) = f_* = f o -    right?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:10:05] yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:10:10] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[02:10:24] I always get those mixed up. Thanks :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:10:44] notdan: Well, eta_B (Just x) will be such a function
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:11:16] So on the one hand we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Just x
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:11:34] and on the other hand, we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Nothing
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:11:35] Aaah, sorry, messed up explicitly vs implicitly here
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:11:41] Makes sense; thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:26:07] I still don't grasp what are representable functors good for
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:26:15] I read http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+functor#examples but I don't understand why I should care
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:30:03] notdan: Suppose that C is a Cartesian closed category with coproducts. Show that there is a natural isomorphism: (A x B) + (A x C) ~= A x (B + C).
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:31:09] (Try doing this from first principles, and then try doing it using Yoneda)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:32:44] The key thing is that there are all kinds of nice relationships between Hom and various other constructions.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	BullSherd	[02:32:49] Wow, Google is making really strange things http://goo.gl/YEkaMA
2014-01-28 12:39:00	BullSherd	[02:32:51] funny haha xD
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:33:02] spam link
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:36:32] doing it using Yoneda == show that their Hom-sets are equivalent?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:36:48] yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:37:17] i.e. show that Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:43:12] I am sorry, I am not sure how to do that. I assume I have to dissect Hom(A x (B+C),X) into Hom(A,X) and Hom(B+C,X), but I am not sure how
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[02:43:41] Well, we have an isomorphism Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom(B + C, X^A)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[02:43:58] ah, I forgot about the exponentials
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[06:01:45] How do cardinal numbers relate to limits?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[06:01:45] I figure both are obtained from many objects by a sort of orthogonal process, where we gather everything together and find an encompassing object.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tomprince	[06:06:00] cardinals are limits in the partial order on the ordinals. (They are a particular type of limit ordinal).
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:32:24] Cale: C is a.k.a. bicartesian closed in the above right?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:33:09] sure, if you like
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:33:49] Cale: and we can't just use the distribution of products over coproducts to show the above?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:34:04] Well, heh, if you assume it, that's rather trivial
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:34:21] Cale: ah, I thought it was axiomatic.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:34:25] but obv not
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:37:18] Cale: ah this is trying to show that the yoneda functor preserves isomorphisms right? Er, not preserves.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:37:28] some word that means the opposite of preserves.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:38:09] It's just serving as a useful tool to show that the isomorphisms already had to be there
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:38:37] e.g. if Ff : FA -> FB is an iso then f : A -> B is an iso
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:38:47] Yeah, where F = y here
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:38:52] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:39:12] Oh. Reflects. Thanks google.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:39:35] Well, and the special thing about y is that even if the arrow yA -> yB we constructed isn't explicitly of the form yf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:40:10] we know that there must be such an f
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:40:22] ah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:40:57] Cale: I can't see the proof of the above. But I can sort of view it dimly, as if from a great distance.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:41:24] (The Yoneda embedding is a bijection on hom sets)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[07:41:35] right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:42:35] So, we almost got there, if you'd like to see the rest of the steps -- really you'd have to show all of these are natural isomorphisms, but that's just a lot of tedious, but ultimately easy checking
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:42:48] So, starting from Hom(A x (B + C), X)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:43:04] this is isomorphic to Hom(B + C, X^A) (currying)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:43:27] and that's isomorphic to  Hom(B, X^A) x Hom(C, X^A)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:44:04] and then that's isomorphic to Hom(A x B, X) x Hom(A x C, X)  (uncurrying each of them)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:44:25] and then lastly we get to Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:45:53] So composing together that chain of isomorphisms (or rather the corresponding natural transformations in X) gets us an isomorphism: y (A x (B + C)) -> y ((A x B) + (A x C))
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[07:46:25] and then the Yoneda lemma tells us that there must really have been an isomorphism (A x (B + C)) -> ((A x B) + (A x C)) in the first place.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[07:52:13] ~the yoneeeeeda lemma~
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[07:52:49] that was the second to last lecture in Awodey's lectures, i think?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[07:53:02] i think its also the subject of the talk Reasoning Isomorphically
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[07:55:06] aha, reason, not reasoning
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur_	[07:55:11] http://vimeo.com/16754927
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:06:32] Awodey also does this in his book
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[08:07:32] augur_: thanks for the link
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[08:07:33] Cale: reading
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[08:07:41] Cale: haven't gotten through the awodey book yet
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[08:08:46] Cale: and that last step is because of what we talked about before, that y reflects isos
2014-01-28 12:39:00	ReinH	[08:08:55] ok cool
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[21:07:48] Yay proved that respectful endofunctor is indeed a monad
2014-01-28 12:39:00	notdan	[21:08:28] proving the monadic laws in terms of 'join' and 'return' was fun, but def more harder than proving the usual (>=>) and return laws
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[09:44:15] If someone says F -| G : C -> D is an adjunction
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[09:44:24] That means F : C -> D as a functor and G goes the other way, right?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:55:49] Probably best to be careful about that. It's usually not hard to figure out what's meant in context.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:22] That would be a reasonable convention though.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:56:47] Though maybe it's specifying the type of G :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:57:10] (at the same time as saying that F is left adjoint to it)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[10:03:17] I guess I should ask Edwardk: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-4.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Co.html
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:07:00] Well, it doesn't matter which is C and D there, because those variables don't occur anywhere else
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[10:07:48] hm
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[10:07:52] I suppose your reasoning is sound
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[10:08:07] But still good to check if there's a general convention to this kind of thing
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:12] ah, and his convention can be inferred from the next line
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:30] He says that GF is a monad on D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:08:41] (and that GMF is too)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	tac	[10:08:43] ah, good point.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	tac [10:08:50] should take a nap instead of asking one-off questions on IRC
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:35:28] Did anyone here read Lawveres introductory book "Conceptual mathematics"? Opinions on it? I'm reading it currently, and I find it curious how it's a high school book for 49 pages and then jumps 500% in demand.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:39:59] NickKidman: I've taken a quick look at it, and recommended it to a mathematics interested non-mathematician friend of mine
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:41:07] Wasn't the jump a little like the jump you usually see after the "introduction to set theory" chapter you see in the beginning of a lot of mathematics textbooks :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:44:00] noteventime: No, I mean it really gets suddently harder there. There he introduces the theorem-proof style simulatnously with the section/lifting/retraction concept
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:44:38] I don't think it'll be an easy read for a non-mathematician, although I love the philosophical approach he makes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:44:55] I've read it
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:45:01] I think it's typical of Lawvere, the style I mean
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:45:45] It's okay, it's really weird though.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:45:51] why
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:46:13] If you're used to ordinary mathematics, the perspective he has is quite different :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:47:33] what do you mean
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:49:39] Well, it makes sense once you know what he's doing, he's developing a categorical presentation of a theory of sets. But for someone who is already quite familiar with ZFC set theory, say, it's a radically different approach.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:50:11] What's the relation between Conceptual Mathematics and Sets for Mathematics btw
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:50:16] I never quite figured that out
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:50:17] oh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:50:28] Right, I was thinking of Sets for Mathematics :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:50:42] Because of the remarks that it was like a highschool book :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:50:46] haha
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:50:53] Perhaps conceptual mathematics is like that too!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:51:04] Cale: Well, yes, I think the description still fits
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[22:51:25] Cale: The way I remember it they were quite similar, though I think conceptual mathematics is more basic
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:51:55] Oh, right, yes, I haven't read Conceptual Mathematics, but I have flipped through it before
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:52:37] anyway, something else: A,B in a category, f:A->B a map. I am thinking about the element/global element perspective which I find conceptually interesting. If f is an A-element of B, then I think of A being embedded in B, right?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:52:37] I mean if S^2 is the sphere then smooth e: S^2->R^3 embed that ballsurface in R^3, I can make a mental image and I don't even bother about intersections (the fact that the thing might be deformed and different points of S^2 map to the same spot in R^3).
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:52:37] But then if I consider space R^3 and a physical field, a section \psi in C^2 say, then I have
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:52:37] \psi: R^3->C^2
2014-01-28 12:39:00	NickKidman	[22:52:38] Can I think of this as R^3 embedded in C^2 somehow?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:55:05] Normally you don't use the word "embedding" unless it's injective.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:56:24] (and in some cases, you'd want to be more careful still, in topological settings, it's usual to say that an embedding f: X -> Y is a continuous map which induces a homeomorphism X -> f(X)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:56:27] )
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[22:57:34] But yeah, you can think of any map X -> Y as squishing a copy of X and fitting it into Y somehow (in general it may not be injective)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[10:30:26] here's a fun game:
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[10:31:01] google "cftwm mac lane", then try to figure out what cftwm is
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[10:32:09] it's like the acronym is not in the vicinity of the book title
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:39:14] huh?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:40:20] oh, if you're trying to guess it just from google results?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:40:59] hah, I get a log from #haskell in 2007 which reveals it, as the last result
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:41:08] while searching with: cftwm maclane

2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[10:41:19] Mar 17, 2007 - in MacLane's Category Theory for the Working Mathematician. ... <merus>, +ACTION wants a university that actually has CFTWM in its library.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	joneshf-laptop	[11:06:57] yeah :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[22:45:48] categorists!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[22:46:23] is there any nice relationship between the reader monad, CTicly, and the representable functors, aside from reader being a special case?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[22:46:39] that is to say, are there nice monadic properties related to yoneda?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[00:07:01] augur: Umm, isn't Reader A exactly Hom(A, -)?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[00:07:55] noteventime: yes, i was wondering if there were interactions between the moadicity of reader, and the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[00:08:52] Though I guess it's really the internal Hom
2014-01-28 12:39:00	noteventime	[00:09:12] So it's Encriched-representable
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:41:19] augur: what do you mean by "the monadicity of reader"?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:41:28] johnw: reader is a monad!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:42:50] I don't see what monads have to do with yoneda though
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:43:23] johnw: they dont, but there might be interesting interactions, hence my question
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:43:38] i mean, reader is just the yoneda embedding, so
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:44:02] reader is just the yoneda embedding of what exactly?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:44:34] reader is a -> r, aka Hom(a,-), while yoneda is Nat(Hom(a,-),f)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:45:01] (speaking of course about covariant Yoneda only)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:45:01] no
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:45:11] the yoneda embedding is yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:45:22] y being the embedding
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:45:42] Reader is just y specialized to the category of sets
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:46:21] I don't follow.  In Haskell isn't the yoneda embedding Yoneda f a = forall r. Functor f => (a -> r) -> f r.  How does that fit with yX = Hom(X,-)?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:46:29] no
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:46:32] thats the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:46:44] the lemma is used to prove that y is an embedding
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:47:01] more accurately
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:47:03] ah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:47:18] in nlab is says the embedding is Y : C -> [C^op, Set]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:47:23] interesting
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:47:33] That is the correct type
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:47:34] the yoneda lemma is the iso   forall a f. Functor f => f a ~ (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:47:48] at least, the contravariant yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:47:54] which is my favorite
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:47:54] yX = Hom(X,-), here, Hom(X,-) is a functor C^op -> Set
2014-01-28 12:39:00	johnw	[08:47:55] hi Cale!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:48:10] Hom(X,Y) is a set
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:48:15] johnw: yes, y : C -> [C^op,Set]
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:48:22] y sets X in C to Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:48:27] hence, yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:49:02] er, wait
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:49:04] or in this case i guess we probably want C^op -> [C,Set] since its contravariant
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:49:13] We've messed it up a bit, yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:49:25] Hom(-,X) is the right way around :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:49:36] Cale: shush, im using contra-y :|
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:49:43] its much nicer computationally!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:50:00] i dont know how co-y is supposed to be interpreted
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:51:50] Well, we have for each a: U -> V, a map Hom(a,X): Hom(V,X) -> Hom(U,X) given by precomposition with a.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:52:26] yes yes but i mean, i dont know what the haskell type is that corresponds to it
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:52:36] everything i try to come up with is just bonkers
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:53:11] like, bonkers in the "i dont know if thats constructively provable" bonkers
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:53:15] newtype To b a = MkTo (a -> b)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:53:30] instance Cofunctor (To b) where
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:54:07] i take it you're using Cofunctor here to mean contravariant functor?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:54:08]   cofmap f (MkTo g) = MkTo (g . f)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:54:12] yep
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:54:16] how weird.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:54:53] I just need to swap the arguments of (->) so I can make an instance
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:54:59] ya
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:55:42] but i mean, the lemma type is like.. what   forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a ~ (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r) ???
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[08:55:53] that doesnt make sense
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:58:57] Well, it says for any object X : Hask, and functor F: Set^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of sets Hom(yX, F) ~= FX
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[08:59:16] so, to flatten that out, let's pretend Set = Hask
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:00:08] For any object X : Hask, and functor F: Hask^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of Haskell types Hom(yX, F) ~= F X
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:00:31] and then yX : To X
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:00:34] er
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:00:38] yX = To X
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:01:10] and Hom(To X, F) -- this Hom is in the category of natural transformations, so let's flatten that into a polymorphic function
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:01:16] Hom(yX,F) = forall r. To X r -> F r  =  forall r. (r -> X) -> F r
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:01:21] (forall a. To X a -> F a)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:01:53] yep
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:02:01] this is why i find it so alien, because wtf is the definition here
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:02:02] i mean
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:02:05] hm?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:02:25] lemma :: Cofunctor f => f a -> (r -> a) -> f r
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:02:49] er, Functor f, no Cofunctor
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:02:55] or is it a cofucntor?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:03:01] errrrr
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:05] maybe thats why im caught
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:03:05] it is
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:10] its a Cofunctor?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:30] ok so thats not a problem then
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:35] lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:03:39] also, you've messed up all the vars
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:51] no i havent, not in that direction!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:03:58] the foralls can scope high
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:04:12] forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a -> (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:04:18] thats just the fwd dir of the lemma
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:04:23] lemma :: forall f. (Cofunctor f) => forall a. (forall r. (r -> a) -> F r) -> F a
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:04:31] thats the bwd dir!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:04:34] and that inverse of that
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:04:40] the inverse is what i wrote :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:05:04] yeah, you left off the higher-rankness before
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:05:12] that's important
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:05:19] yeah but for the fwd direction the higher-rankness is irrelevant
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:05:37] a -> forall b. ...  == forall b. a -> ...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:05:37] (also, I mean f not F)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Cale	[09:05:43] yeah, okay
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:05:57] but yeah, so lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:05:58] thats nice
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:07:38] and the bwd direction is ($id) as usual
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:07:52] thats really gorgeous
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:08:17] i mean, the fwd dir of contra-yoneda is just flip fmap
2014-01-28 12:39:00	augur	[09:08:32] so its really nice that fwd co-yoneda is flip cofmap

2014-01-28 20:56:54	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:37:42] okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:38:25] So, let's see some examples
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:38:59] mjrosenb: I don't know what your mathematical background is like, but every branch of mathematics has at least one, if not many rich examples to offer
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:40:05] The idea being that every branch of mathematics is interested in studying some class of objects along with structure-preserving mappings of some sort between those objects, and generally those mappings can be composed in an associative fashion
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:40:06] Cale: pretty sure I took something from every sub-field of math that was offered while I was an undergrad.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:40:17] ah, cool, okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:40:34] So, you have a category of vector spaces and linear transformations between them
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:40:43] and a category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:40:55] and a category of topological spaces and continuous maps
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:41:11] a category of graphs and graph homomorphisms (of various sorts)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:41:18] a category of metric spaces and contraction mappings
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:42:40] Every monoid provides an example of a category in the way I mentioned already: you can build a category with a single object, and take the arrows from that object to itself to be the elements of the monoid, and the composition of arrows to be the monoid multiplication.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:42:58] ahh, topology, there was a conflict when that was offered :-(
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:43:15] anyhow, linear algebra was fun, how about an example from that?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:43:40] Yeah, so given any field F, there's a category whose objects are vector spaces over F
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:44:21] and whose arrows are linear transformations between the vector spaces
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:44:40] Composing linear transformations gives us a linear transformation
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:44:51] (i.e. composing them as functions)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:45:20] and linear transforms are associative.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:45:21] and for every vector space there is an identity linear transformation
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:45:25] and yeah, composition is associative
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:45:36] and so that defines a category
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:45:51] As a weirder example
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:46:09] Let S be any set, and let <= be any reflexive, transitive relation on S
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:46:23] mjrosenb: I mentioned that one in #haskell too: The category Mat(F) is the category of matrices over some field F :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:46:33] i.e. for all x in S, we have x <= x, and for any x, y, z in S, whenever x <= y and y <= z, we have x <= z
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:46:43] Then we can make a category whose objects are the elements of S
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:46:57] and where there is exactly one arrow x -> y whenever x <= y
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:47:00] and no arrow otherwise
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:47:23] (btw, such a relation is called a preorder)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:47:33] This is a poset category iinm
2014-01-28 20:56:54	copumpkin	[09:47:40] Cale: like what I do on amazon, right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:47:47] Cale: so in the first example, the number of elements in the vector is fixed, and the number of objects in the category is dependent on the number of elements in F?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:47:52] Which has a lot of objects and relatively few arrows
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:47:52] Well, it's a poset category if the preorder happens to be a poset
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:48:13] Compared to a monoid or group, which has a lot of arrows and relatively few objects (in fact, only one).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:48:23] mjrosenb: The objects in the category of vector spaces are themselves entire vector spaces
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:48:25] Cale: righto
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:48:36] For example, if we pick F to be the real numbers
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:48:44] Cale: oh um... oh.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:48:46] Then R^n for each n will be an object of the category
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:48:59] As will the space of continuous maps R -> R
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:49:15] and all sorts of weirder examples of vector spaces over the reals
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:50:13] (each of these sets coming equipped with the operations which make it a vector space of course)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:50:28] Cale: so the linear transforms would be arrows from R^2 to R^2, but is there anything between two distinct objects in the category?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:50:38] Cale: continuous maps R->R is a fun one.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:50:56] mjrosenb: There are plenty of linear maps R^n -> R^m in general
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:51:03] the proof that it is the same size as R was one of the ugliest proofs I ever wrote.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:51:31] (they correspond to n-by-m matrices, remember)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:51:52] mjrosenb: why? :P |RxR| = |R| trivially :p
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:52:13] ReinH: The set of all functions R -> R has greater cardinality than R
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:52:25] Cale: oh, linear maps, not linear transforms.  (I took linear algebra in 2005, I may be a bit of on the terminology, still remember the concepts though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:52:28] (it has cardinality 2^|R|)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:52:43] mjrosenb: nono, linear transformations are the same thing :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:53:17] Remember if V and W are vector spaces over F, then a linear transformation (or linear map)  T: V -> W is a function such that
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[09:53:20] Cale: hrmm, what is the thing that is represented by foo a vec = [a*x | x <- vec]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:53:42] for any u,v in V, we have T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:53:55] Cale: right, which is P(R)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:53:56] and for any a in F and v in V, we have T(a*v) = a*T(v)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:54:21] er, which is equal to |P(R)|
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:54:49] ReinH: So, the hard part is showing that if you restrict to just the continuous ones, then the cardinality is the same as that of the reals.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:54:51] Cale: but I said RxR, not R^R :p Maybe I misunderstood what mjrosenb was saying.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:55:01] Cale: ah.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:55:13] ReinH: I don't know what R x R has to do with it, but maybe you have some idea for the proof :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:01] mjrosenb: Our vectors here are just abstract things which have an addition and scalar multiplication defined on them, so they needn't actually be tuples of real numbers
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:56:16] Cale: uh, the cardinality is at least |R| because of const
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:18] (but in some cases of course they will be)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:32] ReinH: right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:56:41] Cale: and at most |R| because the set of real continuous functions injects into R^2
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:49] how?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:57:08] (it does, but that's not exactly *simple* :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	mjrosenb [09:57:16] is curious about that injection as well.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:57:40] Sorry, R^N
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:58:11] R^N could work
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	mjrosenb [09:58:31] is not convinced  R^N is easy.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:58:35] Cale: oh god I'm forgetting, something something rational points
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:58:45] Yeah, there you go!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:58:47] hand wave hand wave QED
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:59:05] Each continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on rational points
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[09:59:13] yeah those are the words :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:00:00] So you have an injection from continuous functions R -> R to all functions Q -> R
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:00:15] and then it comes down to showing the latter set of functions has cardinality |R|
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:00:17] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:00:22] (which you can do with general theorems)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:00:33] (and the countability of Q)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:00:34] where "trivial" means "I am aware of such a proof" ;)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:00:51] *mumble* crazy diagonals *mumble*
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:01:03] yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:01:03] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:01:43] How much work is left there is highly dependent on how much you know about cardinal numbers in general already.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:02:36] Cale: or how much you're allowed to use on the homework.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:02:55] We can form a (rather large) category whose objects are cardinal numbers, and whose arrows are injections between them.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:03:30] or any number of variations on that :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:04:24] Any ordinal number can be made a category based on its ordering, by the process I mentioned before.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:04:43] In particular, that gives you an example of a category for each natural number
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:05:14] Cale: which process?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:05:15] i.e. where the objects are the first n natural numbers {0,...,n-1} and there's exactly one arrow n -> m whenever n <= m, and none otherwise
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:05:22] Ah, I'll repeat it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:05:26] ahh.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:05:51] You can do this with any set S, and relation <= on S which is reflexive and transitive
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:05:52] no need, just many processes were discussed.  that little snippet was enough to figure it out.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:05:56] okay :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:07:26] So, in homotopy theory, groupoids show up very naturally as objects of study, because there you're interested in paths in topological spaces (If you don't know what topological spaces are in general, you can just think of subsets of R^n and get lots of nice examples of them that way)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:33] If S is some topological space, and x and y are points in S, then a path from x to y in S is defined as a continuous function [0,1] -> S (where [0,1] is the unit interval in the real numbers)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:08:34] Cale: oh right, posets require antisymmetry to avoid cycles
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:52] a continuous function f: [0,1] -> S such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:58] ReinH: right!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:09:51] Cale: is there some additional restriction on S other than 'subset', because with a general subset, 'continuous' doesn't make sense.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:10:00] mjrosenb: It still does make sense
2014-01-28 20:56:54	shachaf	[10:10:25] You can "collapse" a preorder into a poset of its cycles, which is roughly the same idea as the skeleton of a category.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:11:45] so if S = { n | n < 5 V n > 7 }, and x = 4, y = 8, what would a continuous function look like?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:12:03] shachaf: ah interesting
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:12:10] ah, well, there might not *be* such a path :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:12:50] mjrosenb: If for any x and y in S, we have a path from x to y, then S is called a path-connected space.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:13:22] Cale: gotcha.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:13:45] so no spaces that look like anti-swiss cheese.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:14:15] Anti-swiss-cheese spaces are okay as spaces, but they're not path connected, yeah.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:16:56] So, now we define an equivalence relation on paths from x to y, by saying that f,g : [0,1] -> S are equivalent when there is a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> S such that:
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:17:03] 1) H(0,x) = f(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:17:08] 2) H(1,x) = g(x) for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:17:25] 3) H(t,0) = x for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:17:31] 3) H(t,1) = y for every t in [0,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:18:00] so this is defining a path between paths by defining a sheet that maps to the unit square?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:18:11] yeah, from the unit square
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:18:41] You can think of the t parameter as being like 'time', and H providing a sort of "animation" which starts with f and ends with g
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:18:42] yes, it can overlap itself.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:19:00] yeah, that is what I meant by path between paths.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:19:03] and where the endpoints stay fixed throughout
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:20:01] Given a topological space S, we can define a category where the objects are the points of S, and the arrows x -> y are the paths from x to y
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:20:05] up to equivalence
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:20:12] (i.e. equivalence classes of paths)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:21:30] For any point p in S, there is a constant path id_p : [0,1] -> S such that id_p(x) = p for every x in [0,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:22:00] (and we're really taking the identity arrow to be the equivalence class of paths containing that path)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:23:30] *nod*
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:23:31] For any path f from x to y and g from y to z, we can define a path g . f from x to z, which runs along f at double speed for values in [0,1/2] and then runs along g at double speed for values in [1/2,1]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:23:43] which would be the set of all loops that can be shrunk to a single point.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:23:54] and this turns out to be associative up to equivalence
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:24:23] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:24:31] that's a nice category
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:24:36] Cale: you are good at explaining things
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:24:41] pls to be writing a book
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:24:45] It's even nicer because every path also has an inverse
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:25:01] so it's a groupoid
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:25:05] yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:25:07] nice
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:25:14] Cale: but seriously please write a book
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:25:23] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:25:43] Cale: one of the things we taked to byorgey about was the need for some sort of "Category Theory for the Working Haskeller"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:26:16] I realize there's Category Theory for Computer Scientists but I want a treatment especially for Haskell
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:26:32] bot cat theory and abstract algebra, in fact
2014-01-28 20:56:54	shachaf	[10:26:42] But note that it's *not* associative without doing the equivalence classes thing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:26:43] I would be worried that people might read my book before Awodey's :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:26:58] Cale: heh, well lots of haskellers aren't mathematicians :p
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:27:19] Well, sure
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:27:27] But if you're studying category theory
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:27:43] Cale: so, if the space looks like a donut, would the equivalence class of closed loops that go around the hole once be another set of identities?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:27:51] I think it's enough of a distraction that you perhaps shouldn't be scared that what you're learning is mathematics.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:28:06] Cale: right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:28:26] Cale: yeah, maybe what I want is really "Applied Category Theory for Haskellers"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:28:58] mjrosenb: They'd be distinct from the identity/constant path, yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:29:36] good, making correct observations about new systems *usually* means I understand what's going on.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:29:48] mjrosenb: It turns out to be really tricky to prove by direct means that R^2 and R^3 are not homeomorphic, i.e. that there are not continuous bijections in both directions between them which are inverses of each other
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:30:11] But we can get a proof of that by poking a hole in each of them by removing one point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:30:55] and then noting that when we remove a point from R^3, we can still contract any loop to a constant path
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:31:25] but if we remove a point from R^2, then a loop which goes around the hole can no longer be continuously contracted to a point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:31:57] Cale: ok, I understand the second part of that, but I still don't believe the first part.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:32:11] You mean the part about R^3?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:32:25] about r^2 and r^3 not being homeomorphic
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:32:26] Or that it's hard to show they're not isomorphic as topological spaces?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:32:56] Or do you think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic? :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	shachaf	[10:32:58] You would still have to show that homeomorphism ought to preserve this property.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:33:03] yeah, you would
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:33:38] There's still a lot of additional work here which I'm skimming over because I'm not giving a full course on this right now :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:33:54] But I just wanted to give an example of something we can do with this
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:33:59] Cale: I think that perhaps they *are* homeomorphic :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:34:03] ah, okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:34:10] Well, this provides a proof that they aren't after all
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:34:19] Cale: I'll believe it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:34:58] So, in addition to this groupoid I mentioned
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:35:13] If you pick any one point and consider the loops starting and ending at that point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:35:17] You get a group
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:35:44] That's called the fundamental group of the pointed topological space (and the groupoid I mentioned is called the fundamental groupoid)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:37:01] okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:37:04] So, functors
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:37:21] Given two categories C and D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:37:30] a functor F: C -> D consists of two things
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:37:46] 1) A mapping sending each object X in C to an object FX in D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:38:02] 2) A mapping sending each arrow  a: X -> Y in C, to an arrow Fa: FX -> FY in D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:38:21] such that for any object X, we have F(id_X) = id_(FX)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:38:42] and for any arrows a and b which compose, we have F(a . b) = Fa . Fb
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:40:03] Note that if a: Y -> Z and b: X -> Y are composable arrows, then you get a diagram which looks like a triangle with X, Y, Z as vertices, and a, b, and (a.b) as sides
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:40:11] in other words, it maps identity arrows to identity arrows
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:40:29] and "commutative triangles to commutative triangles"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:40:37] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:40:41] (though I hadn't actually introduced what commutative triangles are)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:41:14] draw them with ascii art
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:41:46] .oO(a diagrams 1.0 library to draw commutativity diagrams)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:41:52] since they just added arrows (the visual kind)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:41:54] A commutative diagram in a category is a collection of objects and arrows such that composing the arrows along any two paths with the same starting and ending point will give you an equal result
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:42:29] mjrosenb: okay?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:42:41] So a functor is a kind of structure-preserving map between categories
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:43:04] sec, catching up.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:43:34] Cale: and of course diagrams are functors and now I've gone all cross-eyed
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:45:09] yes, diagrams are functors (usually from some category with finitely many objects and arrows), and commutative diagrams are functors from a preorder category
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:45:10] commutative triangle btw http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CommutativeTriangle_1000.gif
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[10:45:25] Cale: gotcha on all of this stuff, but I need to run plan some stuff for tomorrow.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:45:33] mjrosenb: okay, cool
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:45:44] mjrosenb: btw Awodey has a series of video lectures on youtube
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:45:48] cat theory lectures, that is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:45:50] they are very good
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:46:16] So, the fundamental group of a pointed topological space gives an example of a functor
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:46:39] From the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the category of groups and group homomorphisms
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:46:59] (that's a very nontrivial example)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:47:50] (and of course, once we've defined a category of groupoids and functors between them, then the fundamental groupoid of a space gives us another functor)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:48:16] and of course functors between categories form... a category.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:48:28] Turning continuous maps between spaces into functors between their fundamental groupoids :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:49:11] (these are perhaps not the best things to give as baby's first functors, but they're among the most remarkable examples in my mind)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:49:28] and now we can talk about the yoneda lemma :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:49:33] LOL
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:49:37] before he has to go
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:49:41] real quick
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:49:44] hahah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:55:23] Cale: and then we can talk about representable functors
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:55:36] Cale: and finally we can write a memoization library
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[10:56:06] this is of course the obvious way to derive momoization... if you are edwardk.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:58:45] I realise that's a typo, but I really want there to be an anime in which momoization is a thing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:02:33] Oh, I see how he's using them, okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:02:55] Representable profunctors
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:03:57] oh, and ordinary functors as well, okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[11:04:16] heh
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[11:04:46] Cale: to write a memoization library you must first derive the yoneda embedding. Or something.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:04:59] Well, it's sort of cheesy
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:05:24] The Yoneda stuff is all very flattened out when you try to squish it into Haskell
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:05:44] Remarkably, still resulting in something useful somehow!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[11:05:46] Cale: endofunctors make things a bit simpler eh?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[11:05:48] heh
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:06:10] But it loses most of its original point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[11:06:14] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:33] oh, yall are still going
2014-01-28 20:56:54	joneshf-laptop	[11:17:35] good good
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	joneshf-laptop [11:17:51] has a new favorite channel
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[11:37:25] look at all these words 0_0
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[11:47:52] wow   many word   very discussion   such category
2014-01-28 20:56:54	acowley	[12:25:47] Wow, Cale you really do a great job with these things.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	acowley	[12:26:00] You could provide commentary for Awodey's videos!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[12:56:08] ReinH: I have a tendency to not watch things (on youtube, or otherwise)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[12:57:49] mjrosenb: Awodey's lectures are definitely worth watching :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[12:58:04] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKmodCApZwk
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[13:00:04] In 4-5 hours, he goes over quite a significant amount of material in a pretty coherent way. Probably you'd also want to stop at some points and read some stuff too though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	mjrosenb	[13:32:00] Cale: perhaps this weekend.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[14:54:33] A lot of people recommend me Awodey's book and lectures but I just find his book extremely hard to graps, for some reason :( I only got luck after I read Pierce's book on CT
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[15:02:43] notdan: try catsters
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[15:04:35] Yeah I saw them; pretty much the same, unfortunately. But I got better at CT since I watched the Awodey's lectures, so I am giving the casters another shot
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[15:04:57] i watched catsters about 5 times before the stuff became intuitive
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[15:05:04] but catsters is fun, so
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[15:05:31] yeah I agree
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[01:43:05] Hi, can someone please check my proof that `Maybe` is a non-representable functor? http://covariant.me/stuff/tmp/nonrep.html
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[01:43:32] It looks sound to me, but I just started digging into that topic so there is a high chance I am missing something
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tomprince	[01:59:27] notdan: The typesetting of 'fmap' (there appears to almost be a space: 'f map') makes it a bit confusing to parse.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:00:34] I am sorry, I am typesetting it with \mathord
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:00:39] I wonder if there is a better solution
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:01:00] also the slight space between M and 'aybe'. annoying
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:02:16] Also, you seem to have swapped eta and eta^-1
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:03:12] It would be clearer if you write u = eta^-1_A (id_A) rather than u ~ id_A
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:04:52] So that you get for instance, that if eta^-1_A (id_A) = Nothing, then for any g: A -> B,  eta^-1_A g = eta^-1_A (g . id_A) = fmap g (eta^-1_A (id_A)) = fmap g Nothing = Nothing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:05:36] thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:05:43] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:06:16] it should be eta^-1_B (g), though?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:06:22] oh, oops, yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:06:27] In one case there :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:06:52] yeah, so every 'g' corresponds to Nothing, meaning that no function corresponds to 'Just'
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:07:02] so it's not a bijection
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:07:46] right, or you can explicitly give one which doesn't by using the supposedly inverse map, and show that Nothing = Just x for some x.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:09:01] Not sure what do you mean, sorry. Explicitly give = "... there exists g that corresponds to Just x"?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[02:09:20] ugg, silly hom functors...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[02:09:34] Hom(a, f) = f_* = f o -    right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:10:05] yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:10:10] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[02:10:24] I always get those mixed up. Thanks :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:10:44] notdan: Well, eta_B (Just x) will be such a function
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:11:16] So on the one hand we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Just x
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:11:34] and on the other hand, we'll have eta^-1_B (eta_B (Just x)) = Nothing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:11:35] Aaah, sorry, messed up explicitly vs implicitly here
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:11:41] Makes sense; thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:26:07] I still don't grasp what are representable functors good for
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:26:15] I read http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+functor#examples but I don't understand why I should care
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:30:03] notdan: Suppose that C is a Cartesian closed category with coproducts. Show that there is a natural isomorphism: (A x B) + (A x C) ~= A x (B + C).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:31:09] (Try doing this from first principles, and then try doing it using Yoneda)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:32:44] The key thing is that there are all kinds of nice relationships between Hom and various other constructions.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	BullSherd	[02:32:49] Wow, Google is making really strange things http://goo.gl/YEkaMA
2014-01-28 20:56:54	BullSherd	[02:32:51] funny haha xD
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:33:02] spam link
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:36:32] doing it using Yoneda == show that their Hom-sets are equivalent?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:36:48] yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:37:17] i.e. show that Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:43:12] I am sorry, I am not sure how to do that. I assume I have to dissect Hom(A x (B+C),X) into Hom(A,X) and Hom(B+C,X), but I am not sure how
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[02:43:41] Well, we have an isomorphism Hom(A x (B + C), X) ~= Hom(B + C, X^A)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[02:43:58] ah, I forgot about the exponentials
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[06:01:45] How do cardinal numbers relate to limits?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[06:01:45] I figure both are obtained from many objects by a sort of orthogonal process, where we gather everything together and find an encompassing object.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tomprince	[06:06:00] cardinals are limits in the partial order on the ordinals. (They are a particular type of limit ordinal).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:32:24] Cale: C is a.k.a. bicartesian closed in the above right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:33:09] sure, if you like
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:33:49] Cale: and we can't just use the distribution of products over coproducts to show the above?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:34:04] Well, heh, if you assume it, that's rather trivial
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:34:21] Cale: ah, I thought it was axiomatic.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:34:25] but obv not
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:37:18] Cale: ah this is trying to show that the yoneda functor preserves isomorphisms right? Er, not preserves.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:37:28] some word that means the opposite of preserves.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:38:09] It's just serving as a useful tool to show that the isomorphisms already had to be there
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:38:37] e.g. if Ff : FA -> FB is an iso then f : A -> B is an iso
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:38:47] Yeah, where F = y here
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:38:52] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:39:12] Oh. Reflects. Thanks google.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:39:35] Well, and the special thing about y is that even if the arrow yA -> yB we constructed isn't explicitly of the form yf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:40:10] we know that there must be such an f
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:40:22] ah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:40:57] Cale: I can't see the proof of the above. But I can sort of view it dimly, as if from a great distance.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:41:24] (The Yoneda embedding is a bijection on hom sets)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[07:41:35] right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:42:35] So, we almost got there, if you'd like to see the rest of the steps -- really you'd have to show all of these are natural isomorphisms, but that's just a lot of tedious, but ultimately easy checking
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:42:48] So, starting from Hom(A x (B + C), X)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:43:04] this is isomorphic to Hom(B + C, X^A) (currying)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:43:27] and that's isomorphic to  Hom(B, X^A) x Hom(C, X^A)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:44:04] and then that's isomorphic to Hom(A x B, X) x Hom(A x C, X)  (uncurrying each of them)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:44:25] and then lastly we get to Hom((A x B) + (A x C), X)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:45:53] So composing together that chain of isomorphisms (or rather the corresponding natural transformations in X) gets us an isomorphism: y (A x (B + C)) -> y ((A x B) + (A x C))
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[07:46:25] and then the Yoneda lemma tells us that there must really have been an isomorphism (A x (B + C)) -> ((A x B) + (A x C)) in the first place.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[07:52:13] ~the yoneeeeeda lemma~
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[07:52:49] that was the second to last lecture in Awodey's lectures, i think?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[07:53:02] i think its also the subject of the talk Reasoning Isomorphically
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[07:55:06] aha, reason, not reasoning
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur_	[07:55:11] http://vimeo.com/16754927
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:06:32] Awodey also does this in his book
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[08:07:32] augur_: thanks for the link
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[08:07:33] Cale: reading
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[08:07:41] Cale: haven't gotten through the awodey book yet
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[08:08:46] Cale: and that last step is because of what we talked about before, that y reflects isos
2014-01-28 20:56:54	ReinH	[08:08:55] ok cool
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[21:07:48] Yay proved that respectful endofunctor is indeed a monad
2014-01-28 20:56:54	notdan	[21:08:28] proving the monadic laws in terms of 'join' and 'return' was fun, but def more harder than proving the usual (>=>) and return laws
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[09:44:15] If someone says F -| G : C -> D is an adjunction
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[09:44:24] That means F : C -> D as a functor and G goes the other way, right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:55:49] Probably best to be careful about that. It's usually not hard to figure out what's meant in context.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:22] That would be a reasonable convention though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:56:47] Though maybe it's specifying the type of G :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:57:10] (at the same time as saying that F is left adjoint to it)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[10:03:17] I guess I should ask Edwardk: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions-4.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Co.html
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:07:00] Well, it doesn't matter which is C and D there, because those variables don't occur anywhere else
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[10:07:48] hm
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[10:07:52] I suppose your reasoning is sound
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[10:08:07] But still good to check if there's a general convention to this kind of thing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:12] ah, and his convention can be inferred from the next line
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:30] He says that GF is a monad on D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:08:41] (and that GMF is too)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	tac	[10:08:43] ah, good point.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	tac [10:08:50] should take a nap instead of asking one-off questions on IRC
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:35:28] Did anyone here read Lawveres introductory book "Conceptual mathematics"? Opinions on it? I'm reading it currently, and I find it curious how it's a high school book for 49 pages and then jumps 500% in demand.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:39:59] NickKidman: I've taken a quick look at it, and recommended it to a mathematics interested non-mathematician friend of mine
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:41:07] Wasn't the jump a little like the jump you usually see after the "introduction to set theory" chapter you see in the beginning of a lot of mathematics textbooks :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:44:00] noteventime: No, I mean it really gets suddently harder there. There he introduces the theorem-proof style simulatnously with the section/lifting/retraction concept
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:44:38] I don't think it'll be an easy read for a non-mathematician, although I love the philosophical approach he makes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:44:55] I've read it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:45:01] I think it's typical of Lawvere, the style I mean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:45:45] It's okay, it's really weird though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:45:51] why
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:46:13] If you're used to ordinary mathematics, the perspective he has is quite different :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:47:33] what do you mean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:49:39] Well, it makes sense once you know what he's doing, he's developing a categorical presentation of a theory of sets. But for someone who is already quite familiar with ZFC set theory, say, it's a radically different approach.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:50:11] What's the relation between Conceptual Mathematics and Sets for Mathematics btw
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:50:16] I never quite figured that out
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:50:17] oh
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:50:28] Right, I was thinking of Sets for Mathematics :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:50:42] Because of the remarks that it was like a highschool book :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:50:46] haha
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:50:53] Perhaps conceptual mathematics is like that too!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:51:04] Cale: Well, yes, I think the description still fits
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[22:51:25] Cale: The way I remember it they were quite similar, though I think conceptual mathematics is more basic
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:51:55] Oh, right, yes, I haven't read Conceptual Mathematics, but I have flipped through it before
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:52:37] anyway, something else: A,B in a category, f:A->B a map. I am thinking about the element/global element perspective which I find conceptually interesting. If f is an A-element of B, then I think of A being embedded in B, right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:52:37] I mean if S^2 is the sphere then smooth e: S^2->R^3 embed that ballsurface in R^3, I can make a mental image and I don't even bother about intersections (the fact that the thing might be deformed and different points of S^2 map to the same spot in R^3).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:52:37] But then if I consider space R^3 and a physical field, a section \psi in C^2 say, then I have
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:52:37] \psi: R^3->C^2
2014-01-28 20:56:54	NickKidman	[22:52:38] Can I think of this as R^3 embedded in C^2 somehow?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:55:05] Normally you don't use the word "embedding" unless it's injective.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:56:24] (and in some cases, you'd want to be more careful still, in topological settings, it's usual to say that an embedding f: X -> Y is a continuous map which induces a homeomorphism X -> f(X)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:56:27] )
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[22:57:34] But yeah, you can think of any map X -> Y as squishing a copy of X and fitting it into Y somehow (in general it may not be injective)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	joneshf-laptop	[10:30:26] here's a fun game:
2014-01-28 20:56:54	joneshf-laptop	[10:31:01] google "cftwm mac lane", then try to figure out what cftwm is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	joneshf-laptop	[10:32:09] it's like the acronym is not in the vicinity of the book title
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:39:14] huh?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:40:20] oh, if you're trying to guess it just from google results?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:40:59] hah, I get a log from #haskell in 2007 which reveals it, as the last result
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[10:41:08] while searching with: cftwm maclane

2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[22:45:48] categorists!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[22:46:23] is there any nice relationship between the reader monad, CTicly, and the representable functors, aside from reader being a special case?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[22:46:39] that is to say, are there nice monadic properties related to yoneda?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[00:07:01] augur: Umm, isn't Reader A exactly Hom(A, -)?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[00:07:55] noteventime: yes, i was wondering if there were interactions between the moadicity of reader, and the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[00:08:52] Though I guess it's really the internal Hom
2014-01-28 20:56:54	noteventime	[00:09:12] So it's Encriched-representable
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:41:19] augur: what do you mean by "the monadicity of reader"?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:41:28] johnw: reader is a monad!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:42:50] I don't see what monads have to do with yoneda though
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:43:23] johnw: they dont, but there might be interesting interactions, hence my question
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:43:38] i mean, reader is just the yoneda embedding, so
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:44:02] reader is just the yoneda embedding of what exactly?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:44:34] reader is a -> r, aka Hom(a,-), while yoneda is Nat(Hom(a,-),f)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:45:01] (speaking of course about covariant Yoneda only)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:45:01] no
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:45:11] the yoneda embedding is yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:45:22] y being the embedding
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:45:42] Reader is just y specialized to the category of sets
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:46:21] I don't follow.  In Haskell isn't the yoneda embedding Yoneda f a = forall r. Functor f => (a -> r) -> f r.  How does that fit with yX = Hom(X,-)?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:46:29] no
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:46:32] thats the yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:46:44] the lemma is used to prove that y is an embedding
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:47:01] more accurately
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:47:03] ah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:47:18] in nlab is says the embedding is Y : C -> [C^op, Set]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:47:23] interesting
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:47:33] That is the correct type
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:47:34] the yoneda lemma is the iso   forall a f. Functor f => f a ~ (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:47:48] at least, the contravariant yoneda lemma
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:47:54] which is my favorite
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:47:54] yX = Hom(X,-), here, Hom(X,-) is a functor C^op -> Set
2014-01-28 20:56:54	johnw	[08:47:55] hi Cale!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:48:10] Hom(X,Y) is a set
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:48:15] johnw: yes, y : C -> [C^op,Set]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:48:22] y sets X in C to Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:48:27] hence, yX = Hom(X,-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:49:02] er, wait
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:49:04] or in this case i guess we probably want C^op -> [C,Set] since its contravariant
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:49:13] We've messed it up a bit, yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:49:25] Hom(-,X) is the right way around :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:49:36] Cale: shush, im using contra-y :|
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:49:43] its much nicer computationally!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:50:00] i dont know how co-y is supposed to be interpreted
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:51:50] Well, we have for each a: U -> V, a map Hom(a,X): Hom(V,X) -> Hom(U,X) given by precomposition with a.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:52:26] yes yes but i mean, i dont know what the haskell type is that corresponds to it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:52:36] everything i try to come up with is just bonkers
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:53:11] like, bonkers in the "i dont know if thats constructively provable" bonkers
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:53:15] newtype To b a = MkTo (a -> b)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:53:30] instance Cofunctor (To b) where
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:54:07] i take it you're using Cofunctor here to mean contravariant functor?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:54:08]   cofmap f (MkTo g) = MkTo (g . f)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:54:12] yep
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:54:16] how weird.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:54:53] I just need to swap the arguments of (->) so I can make an instance
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:54:59] ya
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:55:42] but i mean, the lemma type is like.. what   forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a ~ (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r) ???
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[08:55:53] that doesnt make sense
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:58:57] Well, it says for any object X : Hask, and functor F: Set^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of sets Hom(yX, F) ~= FX
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[08:59:16] so, to flatten that out, let's pretend Set = Hask
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:00:08] For any object X : Hask, and functor F: Hask^(Hask^op) there's an isomorphism of Haskell types Hom(yX, F) ~= F X
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:00:31] and then yX : To X
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:00:34] er
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:00:38] yX = To X
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:01:10] and Hom(To X, F) -- this Hom is in the category of natural transformations, so let's flatten that into a polymorphic function
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:01:16] Hom(yX,F) = forall r. To X r -> F r  =  forall r. (r -> X) -> F r
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:01:21] (forall a. To X a -> F a)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:01:53] yep
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:02:01] this is why i find it so alien, because wtf is the definition here
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:02:02] i mean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:02:05] hm?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:02:25] lemma :: Cofunctor f => f a -> (r -> a) -> f r
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:02:49] er, Functor f, no Cofunctor
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:02:55] or is it a cofucntor?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:03:01] errrrr
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:05] maybe thats why im caught
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:03:05] it is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:10] its a Cofunctor?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:30] ok so thats not a problem then
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:35] lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:03:39] also, you've messed up all the vars
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:51] no i havent, not in that direction!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:03:58] the foralls can scope high
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:04:12] forall a f. Cofunctor f => f a -> (forall r. (r -> a) -> f r)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:04:18] thats just the fwd dir of the lemma
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:04:23] lemma :: forall f. (Cofunctor f) => forall a. (forall r. (r -> a) -> F r) -> F a
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:04:31] thats the bwd dir!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:04:34] and that inverse of that
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:04:40] the inverse is what i wrote :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:05:04] yeah, you left off the higher-rankness before
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:05:12] that's important
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:05:19] yeah but for the fwd direction the higher-rankness is irrelevant
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:05:37] a -> forall b. ...  == forall b. a -> ...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:05:37] (also, I mean f not F)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cale	[09:05:43] yeah, okay
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:05:57] but yeah, so lemma = flip cofmap
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:05:58] thats nice
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:07:38] and the bwd direction is ($id) as usual
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:07:52] thats really gorgeous
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:08:17] i mean, the fwd dir of contra-yoneda is just flip fmap
2014-01-28 20:56:54	augur	[09:08:32] so its really nice that fwd co-yoneda is flip cofmap

2014-01-29 05:59:19	TauNeutrino	ahh hey guys
2014-01-29 05:59:51	TauNeutrino	How can I solve simple math equations by considering symmetries?? For example solve an equation for x, just by looking at some symmetry
2014-01-29 06:01:00	TauNeutrino	is that even possible?
2014-01-29 06:01:46	tac_	probably, but that's a very open-ended question
2014-01-29 06:02:20	TauNeutrino	hhm
2014-01-29 06:02:31	TauNeutrino	:/
2014-01-29 06:02:40	tac_	Also, probably not a category theory question, a priori.
2014-01-29 06:02:56	tac_	Symmetries tend to mean an algebraic group is involved.
2014-01-29 06:02:57	TauNeutrino	I know, I asked at #math, but no response^^
2014-01-29 06:03:47	TauNeutrino	Any resouces on this?
2014-01-29 06:04:11	tac_	Like I said, your question in too general to give any meaningful answer
2014-01-29 06:04:24	tac_	It sounds a bit like galois theory perhaps, though?
2014-01-29 06:04:42	tac_	Galois theory lets you look at the symmetries to unknown solutions to polynomial equations.
2014-01-29 06:04:47	TauNeutrino	I'm studying abstract algebra right now, and galois theory is in the book
2014-01-29 06:04:52	TauNeutrino	ahh thats good
2014-01-29 06:10:57	TauNeutrino	ok good, I'll see

2014-01-30 01:30:10	sure	hi
2014-01-30 01:30:40	tac	hi sure
2014-01-30 01:31:08	tac	sure: Do you know about vectorspaces?
2014-01-30 01:31:12	sure	yes i do
2014-01-30 01:31:21	sure	i know the isomorphism theorem
2014-01-30 01:31:46	tac	there's is an analog of a "free vectorspace" that is more familiar than a free monoid to most people.
2014-01-30 01:31:55	sure	yes, the tensor algebra ?
2014-01-30 01:32:02	tac	(In fact, it turns out _every_ vectorspace is free, which is why we like them)
2014-01-30 01:32:11	tac	Well, there are free tensor algebras, too
2014-01-30 01:32:19	tac	But just sticking to vectorspaces....
2014-01-30 01:32:25	tac	Let B be a set. Just any old set.
2014-01-30 01:32:31	tac	F(B) is the "free vectorspace on B"
2014-01-30 01:32:42	tac	This means that B is a basis for F(B)
2014-01-30 01:32:45	sure	generated with some basis ?
2014-01-30 01:32:46	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:32:54	tac	if B = {i, j}, then F(B) is isomorphic to R^2
2014-01-30 01:33:09	tac	F(B) is always the "formal linear combinations" of elements in B
2014-01-30 01:33:23	tac	αi + βj for any scalars α, β
2014-01-30 01:33:47	tac	Makes sense, right?
2014-01-30 01:34:02	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:34:08	tac	Next important fact
2014-01-30 01:34:27	sure	so you take coefficient in R^2 (alpha/beta)
2014-01-30 01:34:32	tac	If you want to define a linear map φ, you just need to say what φ does to every basis vector, right?
2014-01-30 01:34:55	sure	yes, if F(B) is indeed a vector space
2014-01-30 01:35:00	tac	If you have a point (α, β) in R^2, then yes, that corresponds to αi + βj
2014-01-30 01:35:24	-->	conehead (~conehead@unaffiliated/conehead) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-30 01:35:42	tac	So if your basis B = {i, j} again, to FULLY define φ, all you need to do is say what φ(i) is and what φ(j) is
2014-01-30 01:35:46	sure	so you can prove that F(B) is effectively a vector space over R ?
2014-01-30 01:35:47	tac	Would you agree with that?
2014-01-30 01:35:56	sure	if and only if F(B) is a vector space yes
2014-01-30 01:35:59	tac	Right
2014-01-30 01:36:06	tac	So is F(B) always a vectorspace?
2014-01-30 01:36:14	tac	If we take the formal linear combinations of elements in B?
2014-01-30 01:36:23	sure	well, to me no
2014-01-30 01:36:33	tac	Why not?
2014-01-30 01:36:36	sure	because tehre is no action of any field on the basis
2014-01-30 01:36:41	sure	you need to define an action
2014-01-30 01:36:47	sure	so i would check it first
2014-01-30 01:36:49	sure	that you can
2014-01-30 01:36:52	tac	B is not a vectorspace, of course
2014-01-30 01:37:01	tac	But F(B) has an action, I'd say
2014-01-30 01:37:12	sure	did you check it ?
2014-01-30 01:37:30	tac	Using B={i, j} as our example still, γ * (αi + βj) = ?
2014-01-30 01:37:33	tac	what should that equal?
2014-01-30 01:37:41	sure	where * is concatenation ?
2014-01-30 01:37:47	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:37:47	tac	It's our field action
2014-01-30 01:37:50	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:37:51	tac	it's scalar multiplication
2014-01-30 01:37:58	tac	we have a scalar and an element of F(B)
2014-01-30 01:38:04	tac	do we end up with an element in F(B) still?
2014-01-30 01:38:13	sure	we do yes
2014-01-30 01:38:17	tac	excellent
2014-01-30 01:38:29	sure	but you're using the caracterisation of vector space here
2014-01-30 01:38:32	sure	we would first need ot know
2014-01-30 01:38:38	sure	from which vectorspace F(B) is a subspace
2014-01-30 01:38:42	tac	hmm
2014-01-30 01:38:44	sure	or we would ahve to do all the definition
2014-01-30 01:38:47	sure	point by points
2014-01-30 01:38:53	tac	We don't actually need to know F(B) is a subspace of any other space
2014-01-30 01:39:10	sure	to show that it is a vector space we do if you only check that it is stable under *
2014-01-30 01:39:22	tac	Right
2014-01-30 01:39:23	sure	otherwise you have to check points by points
2014-01-30 01:39:28	tac	You need to show the other axioms hold for F(B), too
2014-01-30 01:39:30	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:39:34	sure	suppose it holds, go on
2014-01-30 01:39:35	tac	That should be pretty straightforward
2014-01-30 01:39:41	tac	and I'll leave it to you to work on :)
2014-01-30 01:39:44	tac	so φ
2014-01-30 01:39:45	sure	(i will :>)
2014-01-30 01:40:03	tac	To define a map φ : F(B) → V  (to some other vectorspace V)
2014-01-30 01:40:22	tac	we need to define φ(i) and φ(j), both in V
2014-01-30 01:40:29	sure	yes, if V is a R-vector space
2014-01-30 01:40:35	sure	(same field)
2014-01-30 01:40:39	tac	yes, we suppose here that it is a vectorspace over the same field
2014-01-30 01:40:41	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:40:48	tac	For this whole situation, all vectorspaces are over the same field.
2014-01-30 01:40:56	sure	k
2014-01-30 01:41:00	tac	(The vectorspaces over a fixed field k form a category called k-Vect)
2014-01-30 01:41:21	tac	So, more generally, we need to give a V for every B to defined φ : F(B) → V.
2014-01-30 01:41:26	tac	Does that sound reasonable?
2014-01-30 01:41:57	sure	what do you mean by "to give a V" ?
2014-01-30 01:42:10	tac	For for every b in B, we need to define φ(b)
2014-01-30 01:42:14	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:42:18	tac	and φ(b) has to be a vector in V
2014-01-30 01:42:25	sure	ok, so you need to chose the vector space
2014-01-30 01:42:26	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:42:26	tac	(thus, we "give" a V, for each B)
2014-01-30 01:42:31	tac	sounds good, right?
2014-01-30 01:42:33	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:42:59	tac	What's another way to say "for each thing in B, give something in V"
2014-01-30 01:43:23	tac	(hint, it's the most important object in all of mathematics ;)
2014-01-30 01:43:30	sure	a relation on BxV ?
2014-01-30 01:43:56	tac	yes, but in particular, a function from B to V
2014-01-30 01:44:14	tac	"For every B, there exists a unique V" defines a function B → V
2014-01-30 01:44:14	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:44:35	tac	So everything good up to this point? We're just at the punchline.
2014-01-30 01:44:40	sure	yes everything's good
2014-01-30 01:44:40	sure	:>
2014-01-30 01:44:53	tac	Also, you'll want to draw a diagram here.
2014-01-30 01:45:04	tac	Up top, F(B)... below it, B
2014-01-30 01:45:21	sure	and an injection from B to F(B)
2014-01-30 01:45:24	tac	yep
2014-01-30 01:45:24	sure	phi from B to V
2014-01-30 01:45:32	tac	Yep
2014-01-30 01:45:44	tac	err almost
2014-01-30 01:45:52	tac	we'll have a j : B → V
2014-01-30 01:45:55	sure	ah
2014-01-30 01:45:56	tac	(I think Awodey uses j)
2014-01-30 01:46:14	tac	And given that diagram (it should look like a \/-shape)
2014-01-30 01:46:20	sure	(yes)
2014-01-30 01:46:26	tac	You can "fill in the \/ to make an upsidedown triangle"
2014-01-30 01:46:31	tac	Fill it in with what?
2014-01-30 01:46:41	sure	phi ?
2014-01-30 01:46:45	tac	Exactly!
2014-01-30 01:46:49	sure	and phi is uniq
2014-01-30 01:46:56	tac	And the diagram commutes
2014-01-30 01:46:58	sure	so V and j are "given"
2014-01-30 01:47:07	sure	the injection is trivial and given too
2014-01-30 01:47:09	tac	Yep
2014-01-30 01:47:11	sure	and what UMP says is
2014-01-30 01:47:20	sure	the phi is unique because F(B) is "maximal" in size
2014-01-30 01:47:26	sure	thts it ?
2014-01-30 01:47:52	tac	I would say that you can "lift" a regular boring set-function j to a linear map φ
2014-01-30 01:48:02	tac	(often, the thing you defined has a tilde over it)
2014-01-30 01:48:03	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:48:06	sure	i see
2014-01-30 01:48:30	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:48:31	tac	In essence, j tells you what φ(b) is for every b in B, and the universal property "fills in the rest of the definition"
2014-01-30 01:48:33	sure	i think i understood
2014-01-30 01:48:43	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:48:48	sure	to makes everything compatible with structure
2014-01-30 01:48:52	tac	One minor technical point that you should remember here
2014-01-30 01:49:06	tac	This UMP is a bit special compared to the examples of products and corpoducts in that....
2014-01-30 01:49:13	sure	ahah ok
2014-01-30 01:49:17	tac	Two of the arrows (i and j) are set-functions
2014-01-30 01:49:20	tac	No structure, just functions
2014-01-30 01:49:29	tac	But φ is a (k-)linear map
2014-01-30 01:49:37	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:49:45	tac	But that's the idea behind it.
2014-01-30 01:49:50	sure	i think i got it
2014-01-30 01:49:50	tac	Monoids are the same way
2014-01-30 01:49:55	sure	the structure is "strong enough"
2014-01-30 01:49:57	sure	to make phi unique
2014-01-30 01:50:00	sure	thats it ?
2014-01-30 01:50:02	tac	yep
2014-01-30 01:50:04	sure	K
2014-01-30 01:50:05	sure	thx :>
2014-01-30 01:50:10	tac	If it wasn't restricted to be linear
2014-01-30 01:50:20	sure	it woulnd't be unique yes
2014-01-30 01:50:30	tac	you could have φ map i to some vector, j to some other vector, and everything else goes to 0
2014-01-30 01:50:34	sure	yes
2014-01-30 01:50:39	tac	And the commutativity says something very trivial
2014-01-30 01:51:02	sure	ok so you're trying to find the unique map that is "compatible" with a simple set function, but that is also a morphism for some structure
2014-01-30 01:51:04	tac	It says if b is in B, φ(b) is equal to.... whatever we defined φ(b) to be (which we call j(b) in the diagram)
2014-01-30 01:51:06	sure	and structure tells you this map is uniq
2014-01-30 01:51:13	tac	yep
2014-01-30 01:51:14	sure	ok
2014-01-30 01:51:17	sure	i got it
2014-01-30 01:51:20	tac	cool
2014-01-30 01:51:24	sure	and F(B) is "given" too ?
2014-01-30 01:51:29	sure	or does it also work the other way
2014-01-30 01:51:36	tac	We actually gave a definition for F(B)
2014-01-30 01:51:41	sure	if i find function such that .. then F(B) is the "univeral object" ?
2014-01-30 01:51:52	tac	if B is a set, then F(B) are the formal linear combinations of B (with the "obvious" vectorspace structure)
2014-01-30 01:52:05	sure	yes but does it work the other way too ?
2014-01-30 01:52:07	sure	for example
2014-01-30 01:52:13	sure	suppose i have some objects C
2014-01-30 01:52:15	sure	that respect such UMP
2014-01-30 01:52:21	sure	is C isomorph to F(B) ?
2014-01-30 01:52:28	tac	Yes. (Can you prove it?)
2014-01-30 01:52:32	sure	hm
2014-01-30 01:52:36	sure	i should try on a paper
2014-01-30 01:52:37	sure	:>
2014-01-30 01:52:41	tac	Think of a good choice of V for that one
2014-01-30 01:52:51	tac	Anyway, it's been fun, but I gotta get back to work :<
2014-01-30 01:52:55	sure	ahah ok
2014-01-30 01:52:57	sure	thx a lot
2014-01-30 01:52:59	sure	i think i got it
2014-01-30 01:53:05	tac	If you have any questions on Awodey, this is a good channel for that.
2014-01-30 01:53:10	sure	ok :>

2014-01-30 04:48:09	sure	i have a dumb question
2014-01-30 04:49:04	mr-	shoot ;)
2014-01-30 04:49:22	sure	page 21 of awodey's second edition, one can write a functor between two category C and D as a commutative diagram thanks to two map (the one that sends objects to objects, and the one that sends maps to maps + another map that is expressed with the second one)
2014-01-30 04:49:44	sure	awodey is using an "identity map" to represent a category from the set of objects to the set of maps
2014-01-30 04:49:46	sure	he calls it i
2014-01-30 04:49:52	sure	i don't understand this
2014-01-30 04:51:59	sure	how can you represent the identities from the set of objects to the set of maps ?
2014-01-30 04:53:03	noteventime	Send every object to its identity?
2014-01-30 04:53:13	mr-	Well. C_0 is the set of objects, C_1 the set of maps, and C_2 the set of composable objects.
2014-01-30 04:53:41	mr-	There are two maps from C_1 to C_0: given any element f:A->B in C_1, we can send it to A or to B
2014-01-30 04:53:45	sure	how do you see on the diagram that this "i" is such a map noteventime ?
2014-01-30 04:54:07	mr-	There is one map from C_0 to C_1 (this is i): it takes an object A and sends it to the map id:A->A
2014-01-30 04:54:29	sure	how can i know on the diagram that i is such a map mr- ?
2014-01-30 04:54:33	sure	this is my problem
2014-01-30 04:54:38	sure	i could be "anything else" right ?
2014-01-30 04:55:19	mr-	sure: but it says "i is the identity arrow operation".
2014-01-30 04:55:43	sure	ok so i could write its own diagram at the side of this
2014-01-30 04:55:55	-->	ystael (~ystael@64.206.121.41) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-30 04:56:04	sure	to have for all f : A-> B, f°id_A=f and ...
2014-01-30 04:56:19	sure	anyway thx
2014-01-30 04:56:22	sure	it was dumb
2014-01-30 04:57:15	sure	yet you should write the diagrams of i if you want your category to be entirely dfined by such diagrams, right ?
2014-01-30 04:57:45	mr-	i is part of the data of a category, yes.
2014-01-30 04:58:14	mr-	So, the logic is: Start with a category. That allows you to define that diagram.
2014-01-30 04:58:31	sure	yes, but why did awodey not draw the diagrams for i ?
2014-01-30 04:58:35	sure	he should have to
2014-01-30 04:58:40	mr-	what do you mean "diagram for i"?
2014-01-30 04:58:42	sure	or i'm just too autistic ? :>
2014-01-30 04:59:02	sure	well, f°id_A = f and the other one for each g B-> A
2014-01-30 04:59:10	sure	i guess you can write that as a diagram right ?
2014-01-30 04:59:56	sure	the conditions that caracterises the identity

2014-01-30 05:00:16	mr-	He did not give you a "diagram" for cod and dom either. Why do you expect one for i?
2014-01-30 05:00:33	sure	why would I need a diagram for cod and dom ?
2014-01-30 05:00:37	sure	they are entirely caracterized here
2014-01-30 05:00:40	sure	but i isn't
2014-01-30 05:00:56	mr-	Where are they characterized?
2014-01-30 05:01:13	sure	well cod takes one map and gives one object
2014-01-30 05:01:15	sure	so its ok
2014-01-30 05:01:20	sure	but i could give "any map" here
2014-01-30 05:01:24	sure	so its bad
2014-01-30 05:01:39	mr-	cod could also be everything.
2014-01-30 05:01:43	mr-	sorry, anything
2014-01-30 05:02:10	mr-	The point is: You start with a category. i, cod, dom are part of the definition of a category.
2014-01-30 05:02:40	sure	is i any map from Obj to Arw ?
2014-01-30 05:02:45	mr-	No
2014-01-30 05:02:51	sure	then you need to caracterize it right ?
2014-01-30 05:02:55	mr-	i is the map that gives you the identity arrow
2014-01-30 05:03:07	sure	yes, then how can you conclude i is such a map on p21 ?
2014-01-30 05:03:08	sure	you can't
2014-01-30 05:03:17	mr-	Because it is written there
2014-01-30 05:03:25	mr-	page 22, the first sentence.
2014-01-30 05:03:30	sure	well, ok but can't you write it in a diagrammatic form ?
2014-01-30 05:03:34	sure	to have "everything in diagrams" ?
2014-01-30 05:04:06	sure	i don't know, maybe i want to draw too much diagrams but i feel like its would be clearer
2014-01-30 05:04:13	sure	so you don't need to read "i is the identity map"
2014-01-30 05:06:53	mr-	I don't know what diagram you would want to write. i(A) = id_A. That's it
2014-01-30 05:07:13	mr-	just like cod was defined as cod(A->B) = B
2014-01-30 05:07:33	sure	well i don't know
2014-01-30 05:07:40	sure	it would be clearer if it was visible on the diagram
2014-01-30 05:07:44	sure	that i is the identity map
2014-01-30 05:07:53	mr-	it is not the identity map.
2014-01-30 05:07:57	sure	i mean
2014-01-30 05:08:02	mr-	It can't be, C_0 and C_1 are different
2014-01-30 05:08:05	sure	the map that sends object to its identity map
2014-01-30 05:08:38	sure	you don't see it on the diagram whereas you understand easily that cod and dom entirely characterize your arrows
2014-01-30 05:08:45	sure	so its ambiguous to me
2014-01-30 05:09:30	mr-	I really don't get why cod and dom seem easier to you than i. Anyway. All that is besides the point.
2014-01-30 05:10:01	sure	because cod and dom are enough to characterize your arrows: i could be anything on the diagram
2014-01-30 05:10:04	sure	so i don't get it
2014-01-30 05:10:30	mr-	cod and dom could do anything too!
2014-01-30 05:10:36	sure	sure, but even if tehy are random
2014-01-30 05:10:43	sure	they characterise uniquely your arrows, right ?
2014-01-30 05:11:11	tomprince	How do they characterize arrors?
2014-01-30 05:11:18	sure	as in a graph ?
2014-01-30 05:11:24	tomprince	There can be more than one arrow A -> B
2014-01-30 05:11:24	sure	or maybe i'm misunderstnading something
2014-01-30 05:11:34	sure	ah
2014-01-30 05:11:36	sure	thats true
2014-01-30 05:11:39	sure	and you need identity too
2014-01-30 05:12:14	sure	ok i guess i was just making too much analogy with a graph
2014-01-30 05:12:15	sure	thx
2014-01-30 05:12:16	sure	:>
2014-01-30 05:13:21	mr-	no, not too much. Even in a graph there can be more than one edge between two points.
2014-01-30 05:13:33	tomprince	Depends on your definition of graph.
2014-01-30 05:13:37	sure	sure but you have no identity conditions mr-
2014-01-30 05:13:47	mr-	That's the point of that section. Every Category has an underlying graph
2014-01-30 05:13:55	sure	whereas here because of that, any random cod and dom won't be enough to characterize your arrows
2014-01-30 05:14:07	mr-	where you forget about i and \circ
2014-01-30 05:14:10	sure	yes i understood this section and the forgetful functor
2014-01-30 05:14:34	sure	but i was wondering if there was a way to fully characterize your category purely diagrammaticaly
2014-01-30 05:14:46	sure	without additing conditions in text
2014-01-30 05:15:12	tomprince	You can write all the laws as diagrams, if that is what you are asking.
2014-01-30 05:15:16	mr-	There certainly are diagrams you can draw that would tell you when cod, dom, i, \circ are a category.
2014-01-30 05:15:23	mr-	s/are/is/
2014-01-30 05:15:28	sure	could you give me a link for that ?
2014-01-30 05:15:28	sure	:>
2014-01-30 05:15:59	tomprince	Hmm. Representing C_2 as a pullback of C_1 and C_0 might be difficult.
2014-01-30 05:16:12	mr-	No, but do you understand how to translate f\circ g = h to a diagram? Then you can do it yourself
2014-01-30 05:16:24	sure	well its not obvious because of ° and id
2014-01-30 05:16:34	mr-	tomprince: it's written as an equalizer there. That's good enough, isn't it?
2014-01-30 05:16:59	tomprince	I don't know. You need some text or something to say it is an equalizer.
2014-01-30 05:17:34	mr-	tomprince: not really. C_2 = lim{ C_1 => C_0 } :-)
2014-01-30 05:17:51	sure	(i don't know what is a limit yet so i can't get it : ()
2014-01-30 05:18:23	tomprince	That is just saying that C_2 is the pairs of composable arrows.
2014-01-30 05:18:24	mr-	Maybe that's futile..
2014-01-30 05:18:39	sure	how is that futile to write a structure purely diagramamtically ?
2014-01-30 05:18:51	sure	it looks really deep to me
2014-01-30 05:19:58	sure	isn't it what algebra is all about ?
2014-01-30 05:19:59	sure	relations
2014-01-30 05:19:59	mr-	sure: First you have to explan what a diagram is supposed to mean. f ° g = h should be the same as a triangle.
2014-01-30 05:20:00	sure	so diagrams
2014-01-30 05:20:22	mr-	tomprince: I don't know why you wanted to write C_2 as a pullbak :-)
2014-01-30 05:20:24	mr-	ck
2014-01-30 05:20:56	sure	yes and you need to have cod and dom produce an identity map
2014-01-30 05:21:21	mr-	what?

2014-01-30 05:21:26	mr-	cod and dom don't produce maps.
2014-01-30 05:21:41	sure	well if you want to write the structure entirely diagrammatically
2014-01-30 05:21:41	mr-	I'd better be off to bed. Good night
2014-01-30 05:21:42	sure	they do
2014-01-30 05:21:48	sure	as in graph
2014-01-30 05:21:58	sure	gn
2014-01-30 05:25:33	sure	tomprince: did you understand my question ?
2014-01-30 05:30:19	sure	so my question is, for everyone
2014-01-30 05:30:32	sure	is there a way to fully characterize diagrammaticaly, what it means to be a category ?
2014-01-30 05:30:47	sure	as one can make a diagram which says what it is to be associative for a relation
2014-01-30 05:31:00	noteventime	sure: Check out the notion of an internal category
2014-01-30 05:31:05	sure	ok
2014-01-30 05:31:11	sure	and how is that futile seriously
2014-01-30 05:31:21	noteventime	It's a category-like thing inside another category
2014-01-30 05:31:25	sure	ok thx
2014-01-30 05:31:41	noteventime	Since you need some ambient category within which to interpret the diagram
2014-01-30 05:33:26	sure	is this link a good one http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+category ?
2014-01-30 05:33:45	noteventime	Sure

2014-01-30 05:33:53	noteventime	nlab is always good
2014-01-30 05:33:57	noteventime	Well, almost anyway
2014-01-30 05:34:59	noteventime	sure: Not sure about your level, nlab articles often require you to be reasonable comfortable with category theory
2014-01-30 05:35:20	sure	noteventime: i'm good undergraduate in maths bzasically
2014-01-30 05:35:31	sure	and i just begun category theory with awodey's book
2014-01-30 05:35:39	sure	so i'm really bad at it yet
2014-01-30 05:35:40	sure	:>
2014-01-30 05:38:04	tomprince	sure: At some point, you will need some prose to explain what your diagrams mean. Sure, you can capture all (or at least most) with fancy symbols, but at some point you need to explain what those symbols mean.
2014-01-30 05:38:29	sure	why tomprince ?
2014-01-30 05:38:42	sure	if you can have a full characterization purely diagrammatic (so relational)
2014-01-30 05:38:45	sure	its much deeper isn't it ?
2014-01-30 05:39:16	sure	maybe its much more tedious
2014-01-30 05:39:17	sure	but still
2014-01-30 05:39:29	sure	at least "everything's here"
2014-01-30 05:40:00	sure	i think people put text because its easier to express it, thats all
2014-01-30 05:40:15	tomprince	sure: If you didn't know anything about category theory, and I showed you those diagrams, what would you learn?
2014-01-30 05:40:42	sure	tomprince: well i wouldn't understand wht it means, but it would characterize some structure/relations
2014-01-30 05:40:53	tomprince	In some ways, it is circular. Since you need to understand category theory to understand what diagrams means.
2014-01-30 05:41:06	sure	i disagree
2014-01-30 05:41:31	tomprince	commutative diagrams only make sense once you have categories.
2014-01-30 05:41:43	tac	They are useful informally, of course
2014-01-30 05:42:04	tac	But they do urge you to invent categories
2014-01-30 05:42:18	tac	sure: btw, have you seen how a "diagram" is nothing more than the image of a functor?
2014-01-30 05:42:30	sure	tac: not yet
2014-01-30 05:43:26	tomprince	sure: All the category laws can be expressed as equalities between some arrows (in set), so they can be drawn as diagrams.
2014-01-30 05:43:48	sure	i saw that for categories for which the arrows are sets yes
2014-01-30 05:44:06	tomprince	The fact that categories can describe themselves that way is perhaps deep. But doing it isn't.
2014-01-30 05:46:37	sure	why do you claim that it isn't
2014-01-30 05:46:43	sure	if you can draw something diagrammaticaly
2014-01-30 05:46:47	sure	it means you just keep the relations
2014-01-30 05:46:49	sure	its deep
2014-01-30 05:48:01	tomprince	Drawing a diagram, or expressing the same thing in prose is just surface syntax, which isn't very interesting.
2014-01-30 05:48:23	sure	well a diagram is a good way to represent relations
2014-01-30 05:48:45	sure	and when you say "i is the map that takes an object and sends it to its identity map"
2014-01-30 05:48:47	sure	you're cheating
2014-01-30 05:48:59	sure	you're not "just" reformulating a diagram
2014-01-30 05:49:01	sure	you do much more
2014-01-30 05:49:02	tomprince	Why is that cheating?
2014-01-30 05:49:05	sure	so it is much less powerful
2014-01-30 05:49:11	sure	in the sense that you explicite what is i
2014-01-30 05:49:13	sure	you shouldn't
2014-01-30 05:49:28	sure	if you want a full diagramatic description, purely relational
2014-01-30 05:49:35	sure	you need to keep only relations, ie, diagrams
2014-01-30 05:49:53	tomprince	I'm not sure why you keep saying diagrams are relational.
2014-01-30 05:50:00	tomprince	They are typically equational.
2014-01-30 05:50:16	sure	well an arrow is just a "relation"
2014-01-30 05:50:24	sure	so a diagram is relational
2014-01-30 05:50:53	tomprince	Most arrows aren't best thought of relations.
2014-01-30 05:51:04	sure	i know, but still they can be interpreted like that
2014-01-30 05:51:47	tomprince	I don't think that that is useful.
2014-01-30 05:51:57	sure	i don't care if its useful
2014-01-30 05:52:00	sure	its deeper theroetically
2014-01-30 05:52:03	tomprince	I find your use of that word confusing.
2014-01-30 05:52:04	sure	all that matters
2014-01-30 05:52:19	sure	because you only have the "structure"
2014-01-30 05:52:56	tomprince	What do you mean by "relation"?
2014-01-30 05:53:02	sure	algebraic ?
2014-01-30 05:53:08	sure	only the "structure"
2014-01-30 05:53:30	sure	the "links" between the "objects", without refering to any object in particular
2014-01-30 05:53:58	sure	when you say "i is the map that ..." you're refering to an object in partiuclar, you don't characterize it implicitly
2014-01-30 05:53:59	sure	so its bad
2014-01-30 05:54:04	sure	its not "relational"
2014-01-30 05:54:50	tomprince	You can describe everything by diagrams. When you get to particular categories you need to say something more.
2014-01-30 05:55:00	tomprince	There is nothing wrong with that.
2014-01-30 05:55:08	sure	yes when you explicit something
2014-01-30 05:55:14	sure	but expliciting is going away from the structure
2014-01-30 05:55:23	tomprince	"relation" has various technical meanings which don't match how you are using it, hence the confusion.
2014-01-30 05:55:27	sure	ok sorry
2014-01-30 05:55:31	sure	excuse my use i'm not a mathematician
2014-01-30 05:58:00	sure	i guess its just the difference between implicit and explicit

2014-01-30 05:58:37	sure	what is implicit denotes nothing in particular, and is therefore much more "powerful" than something "explicited" in the sense of "an object in particular, that can be computed/evaluated"
2014-01-30 05:58:37	tomprince	It *is* sudductive to try and use diagrams and skip writting any prose. Just like it is sudductive to to try to solve problems or prove things just using mathematical notation, rather than prose.
2014-01-30 05:59:02	tomprince	But there is a reason that textbooks, manuscipts and papers are still full of prose.
2014-01-30 05:59:35	tomprince	Lacking prose to explain what is going on, bare diagrams or notation is *very* implicit.
2014-01-30 05:59:36	sure	thats not what i mean by "purely diagrammatic"
2014-01-30 05:59:44	sure	thats the point
2014-01-30 05:59:47	sure	implicit is theoric
2014-01-30 05:59:49	sure	explicit is not
2014-01-30 06:00:09	sure	a theorem is never something explicit
2014-01-30 06:00:31	tomprince	Why is implict theoretical and explicit not?
2014-01-30 06:00:42	sure	because explicit denotes not any object in partiuclar
2014-01-30 06:00:52	noteventime	tomprince: I usually find the opposite more seductive :P
2014-01-30 06:01:00	noteventime	My texts always have way too much prose
2014-01-30 06:01:15	sure	tomprince: think about group theory
2014-01-30 06:01:21	sure	an abstract group is a table group
2014-01-30 06:01:27	sure	it is 100% implicit
2014-01-30 06:01:30	sure	you only have relations
2014-01-30 06:01:32	tomprince	"because explicit denotes not any object in partiuclar" this doesn't convey anything to me
2014-01-30 06:01:42	sure	it is not an object at all, it is just relational
2014-01-30 06:01:49	sure	then, you can "find" this structure in object one can construct
2014-01-30 06:01:54	tomprince	sure: By a table group do mean a group given by a multiplication table?
2014-01-30 06:01:54	sure	like Z_2 as Z/2Z
2014-01-30 06:01:57	sure	yes
2014-01-30 06:02:04	tomprince	That is very explicity to me.
2014-01-30 06:02:15	tomprince	It is about as explicit as you can get.
2014-01-30 06:02:16	sure	ok, then maybe i should use relational ?
2014-01-30 06:02:23	sure	yes but the objects, x, y, z
2014-01-30 06:02:27	sure	are "nobody in particular"

2014-01-30 06:02:36	sure	they are not "the equivalent class of integer with relation.."
2014-01-30 06:02:37	sure	you see ?
2014-01-30 06:02:46	tomprince	They are the symbols 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
2014-01-30 06:02:53	tomprince	Quite particualr to me.
2014-01-30 06:02:57	sure	ahah
2014-01-30 06:03:00	sure	symbol doesn't denote anything
2014-01-30 06:03:08	sure	they denote potentially everyone :>
2014-01-30 06:03:22	tomprince	Neither do the the symbols '1', '2', '3' denote anything.
2014-01-30 06:03:34	sure	well they do if you take Z/2Z
2014-01-30 06:04:05	tomprince	But something different if you take Z, or N, or R, or C, or Q.
2014-01-30 06:04:16	tomprince	Or even Z/3Z.
2014-01-30 06:04:36	sure	the point is
2014-01-30 06:04:41	sure	ZF/ZFC doesn't ake any difference
2014-01-30 06:04:48	sure	between "object" and "nothing in particular"
2014-01-30 06:04:55	sure	thats why you don't understand the difference
2014-01-30 06:04:58	sure	but there is one !
2014-01-30 06:05:23	sure	logician should make a theory of what it means to be "implicit" and "explicit"
2014-01-30 06:05:25	sure	and you would get it
2014-01-30 06:05:40	tomprince	Why is there one?
2014-01-30 06:06:06	sure	because on one side
2014-01-30 06:06:12	sure	your object is "what it is" and has some property
2014-01-30 06:06:15	sure	on the other side
2014-01-30 06:06:22	sure	you don't have an "object", you just have relations
2014-01-30 06:06:36	sure	and certainly you can find those relation in "true objects"
2014-01-30 06:06:38	sure	like Z/Z2
2014-01-30 06:06:42	sure	you find the abstract group Z/Z2
2014-01-30 06:06:44	tomprince	You seem to be inventing distinctions that don't exist.
2014-01-30 06:06:52	sure	well they don't exist in ZFC yes
2014-01-30 06:07:01	tomprince	How do you determine if an object is a "true object"?
2014-01-30 06:07:01	sure	but there is one
2014-01-30 06:07:27	sure	tomprince: you need to make such a theory
2014-01-30 06:07:28	tomprince	You say that, but you haven't given me any reason to believe that there is one.
2014-01-30 06:07:29	sure	it doesnt exist yet
2014-01-30 06:07:38	sure	there are
2014-01-30 06:07:44	sure	think about the richard's paradox
2014-01-30 06:08:01	tac	I come back and we're onto philosophy?
2014-01-30 06:08:49	sure	tac: i'm trying to explain why exprssing everything as a diagram is much deeper
2014-01-30 06:10:12	tomprince	sure: I'm fairly certain that you are talking nonsense. Or, at least ideas that are well-formed enough to be sensible.
2014-01-30 06:11:24	sure	tomprince: well, i think one needs to work hard to make such a theory viable, and suhc a theory would explain many thing
2014-01-30 06:11:42	sure	but there is clearly a deep difference between structure (relation) and objects
2014-01-30 06:11:55	tomprince	Not at all clear.
2014-01-30 06:12:43	sure	a structure is something you can find in many objects
2014-01-30 06:12:51	sure	it is in some sense an "interpretation" of the object
2014-01-30 06:13:02	sure	like, you can see R as a set, a vector space over itself, ...
2014-01-30 06:13:06	sure	but the object is "R"
2014-01-30 06:13:26	tomprince	Which "R"?
2014-01-30 06:13:41	sure	well, take (R,+,x)
2014-01-30 06:13:46	sure	you can also interprete it as a set right ?
2014-01-30 06:13:52	tomprince	The one defined by ded

2014-01-30 06:14:30	sure	:>
2014-01-30 06:14:40	sure	as object maybe not thats true
2014-01-30 06:14:49	tomprince	They are isomorphic (in classical set theory), but they are identical.
2014-01-30 06:15:13	tomprince	And in various flavours of intuitionistic set theory, they aren't.
2014-01-30 06:15:40	sure	(doesn't surprise me)
2014-01-30 06:17:58	sure	anyway, as tac said, this now is more philosophical rather than maths
2014-01-30 06:18:10	sure	but maybe one day something will make a theory on that

2014-01-30 21:41:54	sure	hi, is there a name for a category such that there exist an internal category that can be defined without any reference to "set theory" ?
2014-01-30 21:42:16	sure	like, in the usual definition of what is an internal category, you need the product C_1xC_1 and C_0xC_1 + enough pullbacks
2014-01-30 21:42:26	sure	you can define the pullback purely diagrammaticaly so it is satisfying
2014-01-30 21:42:43	sure	and i would like to know if there is a name for category such that even the products are defined internally
2014-01-30 21:44:12	sure	in other word
2014-01-30 21:44:13	sure	i'm just looking for the "required" condition for a category to define an internal category "purely internally"
2014-01-30 21:44:18	sure	 ie, without any reference to anything else than Obj(C), Arw(C), °, Id
2014-01-30 21:45:57	mr-	If you are fine with pullbacks, you should look at the notion of a "limit". Note that Pullbacks and Products are special forms of limits.
2014-01-30 21:46:20	sure	ok
2014-01-30 21:46:21	sure	thx
2014-01-30 21:46:46	sure	is there a name for an internal category that can be define purely internaly in this above sense ?
2014-01-30 21:48:16	mr-	If your category has a terminal object, you can see the product as pullback, even. In any case, the product is described by its universal property. Which is diagramatical, if you will.
2014-01-30 21:49:01	sure	ok, so i should look at that first
2014-01-30 21:49:02	sure	thx :>
2014-01-30 21:49:28	mr-	(In other words, if pullbacks are fine, products are even finer)
2014-01-30 21:50:22	sure	so the map "c" in an internal category lives in its ambient category too

2014-01-30 21:53:14	sure	and so is the object C_1xC_1, right mr- ?

2014-01-30 21:56:07	sure	(ahha no thanks, just did a research plan, i'm over with this stuff)

2014-01-30 22:02:41	sure	thx for references mr-
2014-01-30 22:03:45	mr-	If you understood pullbacks via their universal property, you practically understood limits.

2014-01-31 01:24:03	sure	because in Mon, f is a monomorphism iff |f| (in Sets) is injective, but g is epic doesn't imply |g| surjective
2014-01-31 01:24:26	sure	does it mean that in set, |f| monic, |f|^op not surjective ?
2014-01-31 01:24:33	sure	so the dual in set of an ijnjection is not a surjection ?
2014-01-31 01:25:25	tac	What do you mean by |f|^op?
2014-01-31 01:25:36	sure	the same function in its opposite category
2014-01-31 01:25:45	tomprince	sure: In Sets, epic == surjective.
2014-01-31 01:25:55	sure	yes i know that
2014-01-31 01:25:58	tac	Ah I see what you're asking
2014-01-31 01:26:11	sure	but there is an asymetry for algebraic structure
2014-01-31 01:26:16	sure	so you have to see it when you restrict your morphisms to set
2014-01-31 01:26:18	sure	don't you ?
2014-01-31 01:26:35	sure	its kind of weird
2014-01-31 01:26:46	sure	it means the opposite functor doesn't commute with the forgetful functor ?
2014-01-31 01:26:55	sure	or i'm misundertnading something
2014-01-31 01:27:11	tomprince	It does commute.
2014-01-31 01:27:15	sure	hm
2014-01-31 01:27:51	sure	i don't understand this asymmetry thhen
2014-01-31 01:28:02	tomprince	|g| surjective does imply g epic, but not the other way around.
2014-01-31 01:28:05	sure	yes
2014-01-31 01:28:22	sure	but i don't understand why

2014-01-31 01:28:35	tomprince	It has to do with the specific nature of the categories.
2014-01-31 01:28:37	sure	in Sets sorry
2014-01-31 01:28:58	sure	i'm trying to understand what it means regarding to the opposite functor + forgetful functor
2014-01-31 01:29:03	sure	it says something on them right ?
2014-01-31 01:29:19	tomprince	It is somewhat of an accident that monic === injective and epic === surjective in sets.
2014-01-31 01:29:37	sure	sure i understand that, because there's no algebraic structure

2014-01-31 01:29:57	tac	tomprince: Why do you say that? :)
2014-01-31 01:30:12	sure	but the fact that it is equal in sets means something on the opposite functor + forgetful functor in Mon for example, right ?
2014-01-31 01:30:19	sure	i should try to write it
2014-01-31 01:30:41	sure	its like they doesn't commute
2014-01-31 01:30:54	tomprince	Well, a morphism in Mon^op is epic iff its image in Set^op is epic.
2014-01-31 01:31:26	sure	 F_forget ° F_op^mon =/= F_op^set°F_forget
2014-01-31 01:31:28	sure	is that true or false
2014-01-31 01:31:34	sure	its false to me
2014-01-31 01:31:48	tomprince	sure: The point is that functors don't preserve monic, or epic.
2014-01-31 01:31:54	sure	ok so thats it
2014-01-31 01:31:55	tomprince	The functors do commute.
2014-01-31 01:32:03	sure	 F_forget ° F_op^mon =/= F_op^set°F_forget is true therefore ?
2014-01-31 01:32:04	sure	ah
2014-01-31 01:32:09	sure	i don't get it then
2014-01-31 01:32:26	tomprince	Why wouldn't they commute?
2014-01-31 01:32:26	sure	functor do preserves associativity
2014-01-31 01:32:33	sure	how comes they don't preserve epic and monic
2014-01-31 01:33:10	sure	because the opposite of an epi is mono, and in set a mono is injective
2014-01-31 01:33:15	sure	but in Mon an epic is not surjective
2014-01-31 01:33:51	sure	(whereas it is in set)
2014-01-31 01:34:39	sure	i just wrote the 4 Category
2014-01-31 01:34:44	tomprince	A morphism is monic if when you precompose it with *any* two morphism and get the same thing, those two morphisms must have been the same.
2014-01-31 01:35:14	sure	ok, thats why the forgetful functon doesn't preserve monic and epic
2014-01-31 01:35:18	sure	because there are much more maps in Sets
2014-01-31 01:35:22	sure	right ?

2014-01-31 01:58:20	tomprince	So injective/surjective don't make sense there.
2014-01-31 01:58:38	sure	ah
2014-01-31 01:58:49	sure	because a function is a graph between sets
2014-01-31 01:58:53	sure	thats it ?
2014-01-31 01:59:06	sure	o you can't take the opposite easily ?
2014-01-31 01:59:34	tac	sure: Think of what a morphism in the opposite category of sets looks like
2014-01-31 01:59:43	tac	You have two sets A and B
2014-01-31 02:00:11	tac	and for every b in B (the codomain), you have a unique element a in A (the domain)
2014-01-31 02:00:43	tac	Draw a little circle around 3 elements and call it a set and label it A, draw another copy and label it B
2014-01-31 02:00:54	tac	Figure out what a function looks like, intuitively.
2014-01-31 02:01:30	sure	so it would be the identity ?
2014-01-31 02:01:41	tac	there is more than one.
2014-01-31 02:01:57	sure	yes but if you start from a morphism
2014-01-31 02:02:00	sure	then you take the opposite
2014-01-31 02:02:02	sure	and then you go to set
2014-01-31 02:02:10	sure	to set^op

2014-01-31 02:17:48	Cale	What?
2014-01-31 02:18:16	Cale	sure: Are you referring to the opposite category?
2014-01-31 02:18:18	sure	yes
2014-01-31 02:18:35	Cale	An arrow f: A -> B in Set^op is just a function B -> A
2014-01-31 02:18:38	sure	i'm trying to understand why the forgetful functor and the opposite functor commutes
2014-01-31 02:18:59	sure	and tomprince told me its because in Set^op you have "injective^op" maps
2014-01-31 02:19:24	Cale	Wait, what does injectivity have to do with anything?
2014-01-31 02:19:32	sure	my problem was
2014-01-31 02:19:41	mr-	and that is not what he said
2014-01-31 02:19:41	sure	<sure> take in Mon, f,g : N -> M, where f and g are respectively monic and epic
2014-01-31 02:19:42	sure	<sure> f^op g^op are respectively epic and monic
2014-01-31 02:19:42	sure	<sure> |f^op| and |g^op| are respectively "i don't know" and injective
2014-01-31 02:19:51	sure	<sure> |f| and |g| are respectively injective and "i dont know"
2014-01-31 02:19:51	sure	<sure> |f|^op and |g|^op are therefore surjective and "i dont know"
2014-01-31 02:19:52	sure	<sure> rght ?
2014-01-31 02:19:52	sure	<sure> i can't conclude anythng on the commutativity of opposite and forgetful functor
2014-01-31 02:20:08	Cale	btw, the opposite category construction isn't a functor
2014-01-31 02:20:15	sure	ah
2014-01-31 02:20:28	mr-	no?
2014-01-31 02:21:09	sure	it maps object to objects, maps to opposite maps, and conserve associativity isn't it ?
2014-01-31 02:21:25	Cale	Functors are required to preserve the direction of arrows
2014-01-31 02:21:36	sure	"contravariant" functor then ?
2014-01-31 02:21:54	Cale	I suppose you could say it's a contravariant functor, but that's nothing but a functor from the opposite category
2014-01-31 02:22:02	sure	ok
2014-01-31 02:22:33	Cale	(i.e. you could take the identity functor on the opposite category, and regard that as a contravariant functor C -> C^op
2014-01-31 02:22:36	Cale	)
2014-01-31 02:22:44	sure	yes, ok
2014-01-31 02:23:32	sure	but my question can still be formulated this way right ?
2014-01-31 02:23:33	Cale	So, what do you mean by "commutes with the forgetful functor"? You'll need two separate forgetful functors here.
2014-01-31 02:23:40	sure	yes
2014-01-31 02:23:47	Cale	One which is C -> Set, and one which is C^op -> Set
2014-01-31 02:23:48	sure	i need the one from Mon to Set
2014-01-31 02:23:50	sure	ye
2014-01-31 02:23:54	sure	yes
2014-01-31 02:24:01	Cale	Mon is monoids?
2014-01-31 02:24:05	sure	i mean, does all this stuff form a commutative square ?
2014-01-31 02:24:05	sure	yes
2014-01-31 02:24:19	Cale	What's the "forgetful" functor C^op -> Set?
2014-01-31 02:24:24	Cale	er, Mon^op -> Set
2014-01-31 02:24:30	sure	Mon^op to Set^op
2014-01-31 02:24:37	Cale	oh
2014-01-31 02:24:46	sure	it doesn't make sense ?
2014-01-31 02:24:47	sure	:>
2014-01-31 02:24:48	sure	i dunno
2014-01-31 02:24:57	Cale	Well, then your composites don't start and end at the same place, so you can't compare them
2014-01-31 02:25:22	sure	wait, my question is
2014-01-31 02:26:00	sure	does F_for^op°F_mon^op = F_for°F_set^op
2014-01-31 02:26:06	sure	from Mon to Set^op
2014-01-31 02:26:16	sure	is that true ?
2014-01-31 02:26:49	sure	wait sorry
2014-01-31 02:26:51	Cale	Could you write the types of those functors?
2014-01-31 02:27:09	sure	the type ?
2014-01-31 02:27:30	sure	does F_for^op°F_mon^op = F_set^op° F_for ?
2014-01-31 02:27:40	sure	where F_for is forgetful from Mon to set

2014-01-31 02:27:51	sure	F_set^op is opposit "functor" from Set to Set^op
2014-01-31 02:28:06	sure	F_mon^op is opposite "functor" from Mon to Mon^op
2014-01-31 02:28:20	sure	and F_for^op is forgetful fuctor from Mon^op to Set^op
2014-01-31 02:29:13	sure	and naively, by looking at the asymetry between monic and epic in Mon
2014-01-31 02:29:19	sure	i though the equality was false
2014-01-31 02:30:20	sure	and the problem is, that i did a mistake from Mon^op to Set^op where i assumed that a monic in Mon^op is injective in Set^op, if i understood well, but i still want an answer for the equality :>
2014-01-31 02:31:10	Cale	You shouldn't be worried about monic or epic anything
2014-01-31 02:31:57	sure	well its weird that its not symmetrical
2014-01-31 02:32:02	sure	by reverting of arrows
2014-01-31 02:32:06	Cale	hm?
2014-01-31 02:32:24	sure	its symmetrical in Set but not in Mon
2014-01-31 02:32:27	sure	this is quite weird
2014-01-31 02:32:31	Cale	What is?
2014-01-31 02:32:49	sure	if g is monic, g is injective, if f is epic, f is surjective
2014-01-31 02:32:51	sure	in Set
2014-01-31 02:33:10	sure	and because g^op is epic it is surjective in Set
2014-01-31 02:33:13	tac	sure: That shouldn't be completely unexpected if you look at other, sillier categories
2014-01-31 02:33:14	sure	whereas in Mon
2014-01-31 02:33:37	sure	g is monic => |g| is injective
2014-01-31 02:33:48	sure	but you don't have this implication for f epic
2014-01-31 02:34:14	sure	this is why i tried something with opposite categories and set categories
2014-01-31 02:34:21	sure	because it looks like it says something on them
2014-01-31 02:34:37	tac	Cale, correct me if I'm wrong here, but    sure: in a poset category, every arrow is monic _and_ epic
2014-01-31 02:34:57	sure	yes this is true
2014-01-31 02:34:59	tac	(But not necessarily iso)
2014-01-31 02:35:06	sure	because you only have one arrow from p to q
2014-01-31 02:35:10	Cale	right
2014-01-31 02:35:10	sure	right ?
2014-01-31 02:35:12	tac	The problem you're having sure
2014-01-31 02:35:32	sure	hm, i don't see how this solve my problem
2014-01-31 02:35:33	tac	is that epic and monic are only *part* of what you need to make something surjective or injective
2014-01-31 02:35:55	sure	yes
2014-01-31 02:35:56	tac	The category of monoids happens to be missing the other part, which is (I believe) they are not "balanced"
2014-01-31 02:36:12	tac	no
2014-01-31 02:36:13	tac	regular?
2014-01-31 02:36:18	tac	I forget the term. I think it's regular....
2014-01-31 02:36:19	sure	how comes then in Mon, monic <=> injective
2014-01-31 02:36:28	tac	Because you can prove it :P
2014-01-31 02:36:34	tac	Because it does
2014-01-31 02:36:35	sure	this has to say "something"
2014-01-31 02:36:39	tac	Yes
2014-01-31 02:36:42	sure	on the relations between Set and Mon
2014-01-31 02:36:45	tac	The arrows are inherently pointed, right?
2014-01-31 02:36:46	sure	this i what i tried to show
2014-01-31 02:36:59	tac	Why do you expect symmetry in something where there's clearly a favored direction involved?
2014-01-31 02:37:19	sure	because of the fact that in C^op
2014-01-31 02:37:21	sure	a monic is epic
2014-01-31 02:37:24	sure	and an epic is monic
2014-01-31 02:37:27	tac	err
2014-01-31 02:37:32	tac	be hygienic when you say that :)
2014-01-31 02:37:45	tac	If f is epic in C, then it's monic in C^op
2014-01-31 02:37:47	tac	and vice versa
2014-01-31 02:37:48	Cale	Well, do you know about the *example* of a non-surjective epimorphism in the category of monoids?
2014-01-31 02:37:59	sure	i do Cale
2014-01-31 02:38:07	sure	the injection N in Z
2014-01-31 02:38:21	sure	but still, how comes you have a monic-epic symmetry in Mon/Mon^op
2014-01-31 02:38:22	Cale	yeah, that's the standard example :)
2014-01-31 02:38:42	sure	a surjective-injective symmetry in Set/Set^op
2014-01-31 02:38:50	sure	but no such symmetry in Mon/Mon^op
2014-01-31 02:39:19	sure	this has to say something on the square i gave you Cale, right ?
2014-01-31 02:39:35	Cale	hm?
2014-01-31 02:39:38	Cale	I don't see why
2014-01-31 02:39:59	sure	maybe i'm doing some bad reasonning

2014-01-31 02:40:10	tac	Yeah. You are claiming a broken symmetry, but I think you just haven't gotten everything quite straight.
2014-01-31 02:40:33	tac	Take some time to let your mind soak it up :)
2014-01-31 02:40:38	Cale	All that's left to check is that arrows in the category of monoids are monic if and only if they're injective
2014-01-31 02:40:45	sure	i know that
2014-01-31 02:40:57	sure	tac: well i tried to put that in a square with functors
2014-01-31 02:40:58	Cale	Because we know that not all epimorphisms are surjective there
2014-01-31 02:41:03	Cale	and then we'll be done
2014-01-31 02:41:06	Cale	right?
2014-01-31 02:41:13	sure	thats not my problem Cale
2014-01-31 02:41:22	Cale	Okay, what *is* your problem then? :)
2014-01-31 02:41:29	sure	my problem is, it appears that the square i gave you doesn't commute
2014-01-31 02:41:31	sure	is that true or fale ?
2014-01-31 02:41:32	sure	s
2014-01-31 02:42:09	Cale	That commutes, if you set it up correctly.
2014-01-31 02:42:17	sure	i don't get it then
2014-01-31 02:42:18	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 02:42:29	Cale	I don't really understand what you're trying to get at.
2014-01-31 02:43:27	sure	i would like to find a characterisation of this "broken symmetry"
2014-01-31 02:43:29	sure	diagrammaticaly
2014-01-31 02:44:41	sure	but the square i gave you is just a necessary condition
2014-01-31 02:44:45	sure	its not sufficient
2014-01-31 02:44:58	sure	(supposing its not false)
2014-01-31 02:50:10	Cale	sure: Okay, well, if you want a more abstract way to think about it, the forgetful functor is right adjoint to the free monoid functor.
2014-01-31 02:51:12	Cale	sure: and right adjoints preserve limits, in particular, they preserve equalisers.
2014-01-31 02:51:50	sure	i'm only at chapter2 of awodey's
2014-01-31 02:51:54	sure	i didnt see that yet
2014-01-31 02:51:55	sure	:
2014-01-31 02:51:56	sure	:<
2014-01-31 02:52:13	Cale	oksy
2014-01-31 02:52:17	Cale	okay*
2014-01-31 02:52:53	Cale	Well, the forgetful functor isn't completely unbiased in what relationships it preserves
2014-01-31 02:53:28	Cale	Or which ones it reflects
2014-01-31 02:53:51	sure	yes, and i would like to "show" it on a diagram for Mon to Set
2014-01-31 02:53:57	sure	but maybe my reasonning is just false there
2014-01-31 02:54:03	Cale	Well, you can show it by example
2014-01-31 02:57:25	Cale	The thing which is taking place here with respect to epimorphisms is somewhat special to monoids
2014-01-31 02:57:57	sure	which means that the structure breaks the symmetry
2014-01-31 02:58:07	sure	so you should see it on a diagram
2014-01-31 02:58:14	Cale	There was no symmetry to begin with
2014-01-31 02:58:19	sure	well in Set there is
2014-01-31 02:59:07	sure	and "adding a structure" breaks the symmetry
2014-01-31 02:59:17	sure	so "removing" it should restore it
2014-01-31 02:59:27	sure	so it has to be seen with forgetful functor
2014-01-31 03:03:36	Cale	I think it would be good to be more precise about what you mean there
2014-01-31 03:04:10	sure	I want to have a diagrammatic characterisation of the fact that epic is not surjective in Mon while it is in Set
2014-01-31 03:04:42	Cale	What counts as diagrammatic?
2014-01-31 03:04:44	sure	so of course the symmetry monic/epic and therefore injective/surjective in Sets hold between Sets and Set^op
2014-01-31 03:05:02	Cale	I mean, you have a specific example that epis aren't surjective in Mon
2014-01-31 03:05:05	Cale	So, that's done
2014-01-31 03:05:13	sure	everything that use only "canonical" functors, and °, Id, Obj(C), Arw(C)
2014-01-31 03:05:18	sure	no
2014-01-31 03:05:19	sure	thats bad
2014-01-31 03:05:22	sure	because its a specific example
2014-01-31 03:05:28	Cale	Why is it bad?
2014-01-31 03:05:34	sure	because its proper to Mon
2014-01-31 03:05:44	Cale	You can't hope for anything better than a counterexample to show why something fails.
2014-01-31 03:05:46	sure	if you can find a diagrammatic characterisation it will hold everywhere
2014-01-31 03:05:54	sure	well thats what you think
2014-01-31 03:06:23	Cale	If you think something more general is true, then state it, and then we can think about whether it really is true or not.
2014-01-31 03:06:39	sure	i stated it with my square
2014-01-31 03:06:43	sure	but its false you told me
2014-01-31 03:06:52	sure	and it is just a sufficient condition anyway, not necessary
2014-01-31 03:06:57	Cale	That square commutes, if I understood you correctly.
2014-01-31 03:07:23	Cale	Here's another difference between Sets and Monoids
2014-01-31 03:07:23	sure	i will try to think about it
2014-01-31 03:07:38	Cale	In the category of sets, every function A -> B is determined by its composites with maps 1 -> A
2014-01-31 03:08:26	Cale	i.e. f and g : A -> B are equal if for every a: 1 -> A we have f . a = g . a
2014-01-31 03:08:59	Cale	In the category of monoids, we still have a terminal object 1 which is the one-element monoid
2014-01-31 03:09:47	Cale	But there's exactly one arrow a: 1 -> A for any A -- our hands are tied when constructing a homomorphism, we have to send the one element of 1 to the identity element in A.
2014-01-31 03:10:05	sure	yes
2014-01-31 03:10:08	sure	because of the structure
2014-01-31 03:10:30	Cale	and because there are multiple homomorphisms between monoids in general, we won't have that maps A -> B are determined by their composites with maps 1 -> A
2014-01-31 03:10:40	sure	yes
2014-01-31 03:10:54	sure	and here too, you might be able to find a diagram that shows it, thanks to forgetful functor
2014-01-31 03:11:12	Cale	I don't understand what you mean by "diagram that shows it"
2014-01-31 03:11:30	sure	a diagram that is only using canonical elements of category theory
2014-01-31 03:11:34	sure	in the sense
2014-01-31 03:11:37	sure	it stays abstract
2014-01-31 03:11:47	sure	you don't explicit the functions, you just "constraint" them
2014-01-31 03:11:55	sure	and they are constrained enough
2014-01-31 03:11:56	Cale	We're not talking about *arbitrary* categories here
2014-01-31 03:12:02	Cale	We're talking about *specific* categories
2014-01-31 03:12:04	sure	well sure but still
2014-01-31 03:12:07	sure	this would work for Group
2014-01-31 03:12:16	Cale	The things I'm saying don't hold in general
2014-01-31 03:12:18	sure	and any other kind of such structure
2014-01-31 03:12:19	Cale	one way or the other
2014-01-31 03:12:25	sure	no but they do for lots of structure
2014-01-31 03:12:42	sure	Grp Ring
2014-01-31 03:12:43	sure	etc etc
2014-01-31 03:12:54	Cale	Well, in order to make sense, we'd need to be explicit about which notions of structure we were discussing
2014-01-31 03:13:08	sure	well thats the point
2014-01-31 03:13:11	sure	the diagram would say
2014-01-31 03:13:17	Cale	???
2014-01-31 03:13:20	sure	"if you're a category such that your forgetful functor, 1 map and ..."
2014-01-31 03:13:29	sure	"then you belong to this kind of structure"
2014-01-31 03:14:03	sure	you give a name for all structures that share ths property that their arrows can't be determined by composites with 1 -> A map
2014-01-31 03:14:11	sure	and you show a characterization of why it fals
2014-01-31 03:14:12	sure	fails
2014-01-31 03:14:27	sure	so Mon will respect the diagram, Grp, Ring, etc etc
2014-01-31 03:14:52	Cale	Well, if I've already said that arrows A -> B aren't determined by composites with 1 -> A then I can conclude my assumption.
2014-01-31 03:15:13	sure	but you're using the fact that you know its a monoid
2014-01-31 03:15:22	sure	you don't make a characterization only diagrammatic
2014-01-31 03:15:26	sure	that you "have" to be a "kind of monoid"
2014-01-31 03:15:29	sure	so its "bad"
2014-01-31 03:15:42	Cale	This doesn't happen one way or the other in general
2014-01-31 03:15:57	Cale	Different specific categories will have different properties here
2014-01-31 03:16:03	sure	well, the point is
2014-01-31 03:16:11	sure	Grp Ring Mon all shares this property right ?
2014-01-31 03:16:16	sure	so their might be something universal behind
2014-01-31 03:16:21	sure	true for this class of objects
2014-01-31 03:16:28	Cale	Also, forgetful functors are kind of meaningless, apart from the fact that they are right adjoint to free functors.
2014-01-31 03:17:02	Cale	I don't think there is something universal to be had on the negative side here
2014-01-31 03:17:27	Cale	However, you might be able to show that forgetful functors which are right adjoints *will* preserve monic arrows.
2014-01-31 03:17:43	sure	but not epic
2014-01-31 03:17:46	sure	right ?
2014-01-31 03:17:51	Cale	You can't say anything about epic
2014-01-31 03:17:53	sure	yes
2014-01-31 03:17:57	sure	so my diagram is correct
2014-01-31 03:18:02	Cale	They may or may not preserve epic arrows
2014-01-31 03:18:08	Cale	huh?
2014-01-31 03:18:11	Cale	What diagram?
2014-01-31 03:18:15	sure	the square i gave you
2014-01-31 03:18:26	Cale	What about it?
2014-01-31 03:18:32	sure	precisely it says nothing about epic
2014-01-31 03:18:33	Cale	All it did was a bunch of trivial stuff
2014-01-31 03:18:36	sure	so you can't conclude
2014-01-31 03:18:45	Cale	It didn't say anything about monic or epic arrows
2014-01-31 03:18:50	sure	it did
2014-01-31 03:18:54	Cale	no it didn't
2014-01-31 03:19:47	sure	i should think more on how to express what i want
2014-01-31 03:20:07	sure	but maybe i don't have the tools yet so
2014-01-31 03:20:08	sure	:>
2014-01-31 03:23:19	Cale	You should note as well that it's also possible to have monomorphisms whose images under a forgetful functor are not injective
2014-01-31 03:24:14	sure	yes but in this case, such monomorphism are "already" not injective in the category they are from
2014-01-31 03:24:14	sure	right ?
2014-01-31 03:24:26	Cale	What does injective mean?
2014-01-31 03:24:34	sure	true
2014-01-31 03:24:38	Cale	It's a property of functions between sets
2014-01-31 03:24:41	sure	the restriction map
2014-01-31 03:24:41	sure	yes
2014-01-31 03:25:03	sure	which means you don't have the equivalence
2014-01-31 03:25:08	sure	|f| injective <=> f mono
2014-01-31 03:29:07	Cale	However, in a concrete category you will generally always have |f| injective => f monic, because if you consider some case like f . g_1 = f . g_2, then we'll have |f . g_1| = |f . g_2| and so |f| . |g_1| = |f| . |g_2|, but since |f| is injective, we have that |f| is monic (this holds in the category of sets), and so |g_1| = |g_2|. If this implies that g_1 = g_2, then f must be monic.
2014-01-31 03:29:26	sure	yes i was just demonstrating it on my sheet
2014-01-31 03:29:27	sure	ahha
2014-01-31 03:29:40	sure	why do you need to be in a concrete category ?
2014-01-31 03:29:44	Cale	Usually it does, because the forgetful functor doesn't lose any information
2014-01-31 03:30:05	Cale	Because we're talking about the relationship between injective and monic
2014-01-31 03:30:20	Cale	If you don't have a way to turn things into sets and functions, "injective" doesn't mean anything.
2014-01-31 03:30:28	sure	thats true
2014-01-31 03:30:36	sure	and here the way to do it is the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 03:35:59	Cale	By a similar argument, |f| surjective => f epic will commonly be the case. (That is, whenever |g_1| = |g_2| implies g_1 = g_2)
2014-01-31 03:36:27	sure	yes, so this is the structure that breaks the <= ide
2014-01-31 03:36:28	sure	side
2014-01-31 03:39:13	Cale	So, let's look at the other way. Suppose that f is monic. We have that for any g_1 and g_2 such that f . g_1 = f . g_2, that g_1 = g_2. However, this *doesn't* tell us that f is injective. If we apply the forgetful functor to things we can get that if |f| . |g_1| = |f| . |g_2| then |g_1| = |g_2|, but that only tells us about functions which happened to come from arrows under our forgetful functor.
2014-01-31 03:40:37	sure	yes, you don't know about the other ones
2014-01-31 03:40:50	sure	but in Mon, if f is monic, |f| is injective right ?
2014-01-31 03:41:07	sure	because of UMP
2014-01-31 03:41:48	<--	chris2 (~chris@vuxu.org) が終了 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2014-01-31 03:42:15	Cale	Well, because there's a free monoid on one generator we can use to separate them via a sneaky argument.
2014-01-31 03:42:31	sure	yes
2014-01-31 03:42:49	<--	tac (~tac-tics@cip-248.trustwave.com) が ##categorytheory から退出 ("Leaving")
2014-01-31 03:43:59	Cale	So, whenever there's this free/forgetful pairing, a similar argument can typically be made to work
2014-01-31 03:44:34	Cale	But we won't generally have some kind of universal widget to characterise maps from the other side.
2014-01-31 03:44:57	sure	from set to structure
2014-01-31 03:44:59	sure	you mean?
2014-01-31 03:45:43	sure	because clearly here you have what i mean by "diagramatic characterization"
2014-01-31 03:45:45	sure	with UMP
2014-01-31 03:45:46	Cale	For example, monoid homomorphisms A -> B are determined by their composites with maps from the free monoid on one generator to A, i.e. F(1) -> A
2014-01-31 03:46:36	Cale	However, there's no monoid U such that knowing the composites of f: A -> B with all the maps B -> U will tell us what f was
2014-01-31 03:47:27	sure	ok
2014-01-31 03:47:32	sure	thats what you call "the other side"
2014-01-31 03:47:42	sure	but in some sense
2014-01-31 03:47:53	sure	in Sets, knowing all the composites with 1 -> A
2014-01-31 03:47:54	Cale	So we can't make the analogous sneaky argument for monoids
2014-01-31 03:47:56	-->	chris2 (~chris@vuxu.org) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-31 03:48:12	sure	is equivalent in structures with having the ump property
2014-01-31 03:48:17	sure	for free monoid with one generator
2014-01-31 03:48:50	sure	and i bet this holds in Grp, Ring, and so on
2014-01-31 03:48:59	Cale	Yeah, if you can get something which has the universal property of a free object on one generator, then that argument will go through
2014-01-31 03:49:08	sure	ok group works then
2014-01-31 03:49:10	Cale	It's always going to be somewhat specific to the category you're working with
2014-01-31 03:49:24	sure	yes but you have your caracterisation
2014-01-31 03:49:27	Cale	There are some wide classes of categories we could make this work in
2014-01-31 03:49:32	sure	its "having the ump of free object with one generator"
2014-01-31 03:49:39	Cale	but you haven't read enough of Awodey to understand those yet :)
2014-01-31 03:49:44	sure	ahah yes
2014-01-31 03:49:55	sure	i took the 2nd edition btw Cale
2014-01-31 03:49:58	sure	not the one you gave me
2014-01-31 03:50:01	sure	its better
2014-01-31 03:50:22	Cale	Oh, I didn't know there was another edition
2014-01-31 03:54:37	Cale	sure: So, the thing which *really* characterises the forgetful functor in general is that it's "right adjoint" to the free functor
2014-01-31 03:55:36	sure	ok
2014-01-31 03:55:54	Cale	i.e. If F: Set -> Mon is the free monoid functor, and |-|: Mon -> Set is the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 03:56:36	Cale	Then we have that monoid homomorphisms FX -> M are in exact correspondence with functions X -> |M|
2014-01-31 03:57:00	sure	ok
2014-01-31 03:57:06	sure	which is the UMP
2014-01-31 03:57:09	Cale	yeah
2014-01-31 03:57:11	sure	its a formulation of the ump
2014-01-31 03:57:12	sure	i see
2014-01-31 03:58:06	sure	you make me want to understand that asap
2014-01-31 03:58:06	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 03:58:30	sure	adjoint: page 200
2014-01-31 03:58:31	sure	: (
2014-01-31 04:00:32	Cale	Well, almost the entire rest of the book (and classical category theory done around the 1960's) is built up around trying to express what universal mapping properties "are"
2014-01-31 04:00:49	Cale	in more and more general ways
2014-01-31 04:00:53	sure	i see
2014-01-31 04:04:18	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-31 04:06:47	Cale	Now, in the category of sets, the trick to prove that every epimorphism f: X -> Y is surjective is to compose it with both g_1: Y -> 2 which acts by g_1(y) = 1 if y is in f(X), and g_1(y) = 0 otherwise, and g_2: Y -> 2 which is just the constant function giving 1
2014-01-31 04:07:47	Cale	Then we see that (g_1 . f)(x) = g_1(f(x)) = 1, and (g_2 . f)(x) = g_2(f(x)) = 1 for every x in X, so g_1 . f = g_2 . f
2014-01-31 04:08:03	Cale	and by f being epic, we have g_1 = g_2
2014-01-31 04:08:31	Cale	But this means that for every y in Y, g_1(y) = 1, so y is in f(X).
2014-01-31 04:08:55	sure	thus, f is surjective
2014-01-31 04:08:58	Cale	yes
2014-01-31 04:09:01	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:09:05	sure	nice proof
2014-01-31 04:09:06	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:11:27	Cale	To be able to generalise that to another category, we need a suitable generalisation of 2.
2014-01-31 04:11:39	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:11:47	sure	that is not "too constrained" by the structure
2014-01-31 04:11:49	sure	as for 1
2014-01-31 04:11:54	sure	thats it ?
2014-01-31 04:12:00	sure	(for arrows)
2014-01-31 04:12:25	Cale	The free monoid functor was a *left* adjoint to the forgetful functor. (i.e. the forgetful functor was right adjoint to it)
2014-01-31 04:12:52	Cale	It turns out the right thing to make this argument work is that we need a *right* adjoint to the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 04:13:22	sure	so basically, the characterisation i was looking for
2014-01-31 04:13:25	Cale	Or rather to lift the argument to another category the way we did with monoids and the free/forgetful thing
2014-01-31 04:13:29	sure	is given by the existence of an adjoint
2014-01-31 04:13:33	Cale	yeah
2014-01-31 04:13:33	sure	a right adjoint
2014-01-31 04:13:35	sure	ok
2014-01-31 04:14:06	sure	but its weird because you don't need the Op category
2014-01-31 04:14:12	Cale	For example, in the category of topological spaces, the forgetful functor Top -> Set has both a left and right adjoint
2014-01-31 04:14:14	sure	whereas the symmetry on set holds in op
2014-01-31 04:14:23	Cale	The left adjoint makes the discrete topology on a set
2014-01-31 04:14:31	Cale	the right adjoint makes the indiscrete topology
2014-01-31 04:14:55	sure	so the adjoint
2014-01-31 04:14:58	sure	"lift" up the structure
2014-01-31 04:14:58	Cale	Using the indiscrete topology on 2 = {0,1}
2014-01-31 04:15:01	sure	the set to the structure
2014-01-31 04:15:27	Cale	We can make a similar argument go through
2014-01-31 04:16:30	Cale	Using the indiscrete topology here is important, because if we tried to use the discrete topology on {0,1}, then the map g_1 we considered before might not be continuous
2014-01-31 04:16:53	Cale	(i.e. the map which sends the range of f to 1 and everything else to 0)
2014-01-31 04:17:25	sure	ok
2014-01-31 04:17:29	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:17:33	sure	so you can gneralize exactly the same prof
2014-01-31 04:17:42	sure	so in Top, epic <=> surjective
2014-01-31 04:17:53	Cale	yeah
2014-01-31 04:18:15	sure	what about the concept of site ?
2014-01-31 04:18:24	Cale	This also works out in some categories where we don't get a right adjoint to the forgetful functor, for various other reasons, but that's a pretty general way to get it.
2014-01-31 04:19:13	Cale	For example, in the category of groups, this is quite tricky iirc.
2014-01-31 04:19:30	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:19:32	sure	so it not universal
2014-01-31 04:19:44	sure	so the existence of an adjoint (right)
2014-01-31 04:19:47	sure	is just a sufficient condition
2014-01-31 04:19:50	sure	its not even necessary
2014-01-31 04:19:52	Cale	yeah
2014-01-31 04:19:58	sure	so its not a "good" concept
2014-01-31 04:19:58	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:20:08	sure	(i mean, it is, but its not perfect)
2014-01-31 04:20:17	Cale	The same thing is true on the other side with monomorphisms
2014-01-31 04:20:42	Cale	If our forgetful functor doesn't have a left adjoint, then that argument won't work
2014-01-31 04:21:02	sure	i guess this concept of adjoint is what i was looking for
2014-01-31 04:21:04	Cale	(but usually we wouldn't call something a forgetful functor unless it had a left adjoint)
2014-01-31 04:21:13	sure	(but of course i wouldn't find it alone)
2014-01-31 04:21:44	sure	so maybe there's a better concept to characterise the equivalence between epic and monic
2014-01-31 04:21:51	sure	that is also a necessary condition
2014-01-31 04:22:03	sure	erm
2014-01-31 04:22:06	sure	epic and surjective sorry
2014-01-31 04:22:09	Cale	In general, this question gets so hairy, that I doubt there's any simple necessary and sufficient condition.

2014-01-31 04:22:20	sure	well, you have to be creative ,}
2014-01-31 04:22:49	sure	if there is none, it means the question "why epic is equivalent to surjective in some case and not other ?" is a bad question
2014-01-31 04:22:49	Cale	Especially characterising the epimorphisms of arbitrary categories tends to get ridiculously hard
2014-01-31 04:23:40	tomprince	sure: It isn't a bad question. It just doesn't have a simple answer.

2014-01-31 04:25:03	tomprince	No. There are is lots of interesting mathematics to explore/discover trying to answer. So it isn't a bad question.
2014-01-31 04:25:28	sure	it is a bad question in the sense that there might be a better question to ask and answer tomprince
2014-01-31 04:25:31	sure	a better "view point"
2014-01-31 04:25:52	tomprince	That doesn't make bad.
2014-01-31 04:25:57	Cale	sure: It's a very good question in general what the epimorphisms or monomorphisms in a category are, precisely *because* it tells you something nontrivial about your category.
2014-01-31 04:26:10	sure	yes, like the existence of adjoints
2014-01-31 04:26:12	tomprince	Things are typically black and white.
2014-01-31 04:26:13	sure	as you told me
2014-01-31 04:26:19	Cale	If they were always easily characterised, then it would be a boring question :)
2014-01-31 04:26:23	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:26:27	sure	thats true too
2014-01-31 04:26:28	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:26:34	sure	oh by the way
2014-01-31 04:26:36	sure	yesterday
2014-01-31 04:26:46	sure	i was looking for a characterization of what it is to be a category, inside a category
2014-01-31 04:26:58	Cale	Ah, there are some ways to do that :)
2014-01-31 04:27:01	tomprince	Just because there isn't a good answer, doesn't mean that a question is bad. In fact, in mathematics, you could argue that that is part of the definition of a *good* question.
2014-01-31 04:27:02	sure	and someone (was it you tomprince?) refered me to the concept of inertal category
2014-01-31 04:27:26	sure	so i checked it today, but is there a way to express the product from the "new" composite map "c" from C_1xC_1 purely internaly ?
2014-01-31 04:27:27	<--	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) が終了 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2014-01-31 04:27:42	sure	ie, only with Id_A, °, Obj(C), Arw(C) where C is the ambient category ?
2014-01-31 04:28:05	sure	(internal category sory)
2014-01-31 04:28:23	Cale	sure: You generally need to have pullbacks to be able to express when arrows are composable
2014-01-31 04:28:29	sure	yes i saw that
2014-01-31 04:28:32	Cale	If that's what you're asking
2014-01-31 04:28:39	sure	but its ok, you can "assume" you have enough pullbacks
2014-01-31 04:28:47	sure	they are here, in the category ambient
2014-01-31 04:28:53	sure	but what about C_1xC_1 ?
2014-01-31 04:29:02	sure	is it an object of the ambient category ? if yes, how to know if its there ?
2014-01-31 04:29:28	-->	Eduard_Munteanu (~EduardMun@188.25.93.188) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-01-31 04:29:34	Cale	Well, C_1 x C_1 may exist (it probably does in any category which also has all the pullbacks you need, unless something strange is taking place)
2014-01-31 04:29:47	Cale	But it expresses something which isn't so important
2014-01-31 04:30:09	sure	you need it in order to have a composite map right ?
2014-01-31 04:30:11	Cale	It's an object which represents arbitrary pairs of arrows which might not line up
2014-01-31 04:30:42	Cale	In order to have a composite map, you need the pullback of C_1 and C_1 along the source and target maps to C_0
2014-01-31 04:31:14	sure	so pullbacks ensure the existnce of C_1xC_1 ?
2014-01-31 04:31:17	Cale	This is often just written C_1 x_(C_0) C_1, to give the impression that it has something to do with the product of C_1 and C_1
2014-01-31 04:31:23	sure	ok
2014-01-31 04:31:24	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:31:28	sure	so i didn't understand this notation
2014-01-31 04:31:33	Cale	If you have all pullbacks and you have a terminal object, then you have all products.
2014-01-31 04:31:40	sure	ok
2014-01-31 04:31:59	sure	well, thats really elegant
2014-01-31 04:32:05	sure	to characterize what it is to be a category
2014-01-31 04:32:10	sure	inside category theory itself
2014-01-31 04:32:11	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:32:19	Cale	There's also lots of other fun ways to do it
2014-01-31 04:32:32	sure	i saw that you can do the same with functors
2014-01-31 04:32:41	sure	so i guess you can also code lots of funny things internally
2014-01-31 04:32:50	Cale	There's a 2-category of spans of sets, where a span of sets is a diagram which looks like  A <- S -> B
2014-01-31 04:33:53	Cale	and you define a composite of spans A <- S_1 -> B and B <- S_2 -> C by taking a pullback of the diagram S_1 -> B <- S_2
2014-01-31 04:33:59	Cale	and then composing down the sides
2014-01-31 04:34:42	Cale	and given two spans with the same "domain" and "codomain": say A <- S_1 -> B and A <- S_2 -> B
2014-01-31 04:34:54	Cale	then you can define maps between them as functions S_1 -> S_2 which make the diagram commute
2014-01-31 04:35:05	Cale	and that gets you a 2-category structure
2014-01-31 04:35:09	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:35:27	sure	this reminds me of the concept of slice category
2014-01-31 04:35:34	sure	how you "transport" diagrams
2014-01-31 04:35:35	Cale	For any 2-category, you can talk about monads *in* that category
2014-01-31 04:35:37	sure	to create arrows
2014-01-31 04:36:08	sure	what's a monad ?
2014-01-31 04:36:18	Cale	oh, you haven't got to those yet :)
2014-01-31 04:36:20	Cale	right
2014-01-31 04:36:35	sure	i'm at chapter 2 of awodey
2014-01-31 04:36:38	Cale	I suppose it would be a bit awkward to talk about this generalisation of them :)
2014-01-31 04:36:42	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:36:56	Cale	Yeah, I was sort of assuming that you were coming from Haskell or something.
2014-01-31 04:37:03	sure	ahah no
2014-01-31 04:37:05	sure	i'm beginner
2014-01-31 04:37:06	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:37:22	Eduard_Munteanu	Indeed, if you talk CT in #haskell, chances are you know about monads already. :)
2014-01-31 04:37:33	Cale	(People who learn category theory because of functional programming tend to learn everything in a weird order)
2014-01-31 04:37:43	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:37:47	sure	i learn it for physics :>
2014-01-31 04:37:53	Cale	ah, okay
2014-01-31 04:38:06	sure	i think its the future
2014-01-31 04:38:09	sure	but nobody agrees with me
2014-01-31 04:38:09	sure	:<
2014-01-31 04:38:15	Cale	Well, it's the present
2014-01-31 04:38:18	sure	true
2014-01-31 04:38:27	Cale	At least, of mathematics
2014-01-31 04:38:40	Cale	Category theoretical notation has worked its way into pretty much every corner of mathematics
2014-01-31 04:38:54	sure	so its a "must know" theory
2014-01-31 04:39:09	ystael	well, if you do PDE or something, you might still be mostly cheerfully oblivious :)
2014-01-31 04:39:23	Cale	yeah, there are some areas of analysis where you see a bit less of it
2014-01-31 04:40:00	Cale	But it's amazing to think that before CT came along, people didn't write f: A -> B
2014-01-31 04:40:09	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:40:10	Eduard_Munteanu	Oh?
2014-01-31 04:40:14	sure	i didn't know that
2014-01-31 04:40:15	Cale	and if you go look at old books, they really didn't!
2014-01-31 04:40:46	sure	what interests me is also the links of CT with fundation of mathematics
2014-01-31 04:40:49	Cale	Though you did see some odd things like f: A subset B
2014-01-31 04:40:56	sure	like, topos and stuff, i would like to understand them :<
2014-01-31 04:41:23	Eduard_Munteanu	sure: Baez worked on getting CT to express things physics, btw.
2014-01-31 04:41:31	Cale	sure: Lately I've been drinking the homotopy type theory kool-aid pretty hard.
2014-01-31 04:41:52	sure	Eduard_Munteanu: yes i heard about that
2014-01-31 04:41:55	sure	but he is doing higher categories
2014-01-31 04:43:13	Eduard_Munteanu	sure: http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage
2014-01-31 04:43:46	Cale	sure: I think that ultimately constructive mathematics might be more appropriate for physics. Constructive (intuitionist) logic is more natural from a category theoretical perspective.
2014-01-31 04:44:16	Cale	There are a bunch of foundational things which worry me about the present state of physics
2014-01-31 04:45:49	sure	Cale: yes, i'm "intuitionist" anyway
2014-01-31 04:46:02	sure	well there should be a theory of what is a physical theory
2014-01-31 04:46:09	sure	this is missing
2014-01-31 04:46:37	Cale	I'm actually not, I'm more of a formalist, but I think intuitionist logic and constructive mathematics are useful, so we should study them :)
2014-01-31 04:47:00	sure	i would describe me as
2014-01-31 04:47:01	Eduard_Munteanu	Yes, leave sphere multiplication to religion or politics. :P
2014-01-31 04:47:05	sure	an "dynamical intuitionist"
2014-01-31 04:47:10	sure	or "interationist"
2014-01-31 04:47:15	Cale	One of my concerns with the state of physics is just a social thing: physicists tend to be quite lax when it comes to formalising things mathematically.
2014-01-31 04:47:29	sure	i think physics needs a logif of truth/knowledge that is dyamical in the sense of linear logic
2014-01-31 04:47:42	sure	yes Cale, because they don't want to put the effort into learning the maths
2014-01-31 04:47:45	sure	and i hate that
2014-01-31 04:47:49	sure	most of them are doing shitty physics
2014-01-31 04:47:51	sure	for example QFT
2014-01-31 04:47:58	Cale	I think this is a dangerous thing: in order to be meaningful, our physical models need to predict some things and not others.
2014-01-31 04:48:12	sure	you have a rigorous formulation (AQF) that proves that what physicist do and "hope" with usual QFT is meaningless
2014-01-31 04:48:27	Cale	If by accident, you introduce a contradiction into your mathematics, then logic will let you prove (or predict!) anything
2014-01-31 04:48:32	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:48:34	sure	totally
2014-01-31 04:48:39	sure	this is the case with renormalization

2014-01-31 04:48:49	sure	renormalization is something i never understood (and never will)
2014-01-31 04:49:46	sure	but its a matter of effort
2014-01-31 04:49:53	sure	most physicists don't want to work hard
2014-01-31 04:49:57	Cale	But if something you're doing to calculate predictions is working, despite not actually following the usual rules, we should certainly figure out what the computations are that you're doing and formulate the theory in terms of those.
2014-01-31 04:49:59	sure	they don't want to lern maths
2014-01-31 04:50:45	Cale	I suppose the other thing which is important about constructive mathematics is that you're guaranteed in some ways to be able to compute things.
2014-01-31 04:51:24	sure	yes
2014-01-31 04:51:34	sure	and thats what you want in physics
2014-01-31 04:51:35	Cale	With classical mathematics, LEM and the axiom of choice can destroy the computational nature of results, and you might end up with a physical theory which nonetheless you cannot compute anything it predicts.
2014-01-31 04:51:41	sure	having a theory in which you can formulate models where things are computable
2014-01-31 04:51:54	sure	LEM = ?
2014-01-31 04:51:59	Cale	Law of excluded middle
2014-01-31 04:52:03	sure	oh yes
2014-01-31 04:52:04	sure	true
2014-01-31 04:52:26	sure	thats why intuitionism is more "physical"
2014-01-31 04:52:27	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:52:35	sure	you are ony convinced of what you can compute and express explicitly
2014-01-31 04:52:40	sure	otherwise you don't conclude anything
2014-01-31 04:53:08	sure	but the "good" logic of physics isn ot classical
2014-01-31 04:53:19	sure	i think it is something dynamical and related to "knowledge"
2014-01-31 04:53:25	Cale	However, I think classical mathematics is still a) really fun to do, and b) can be carried out in a way that the results are still useful even if all the applications are making use of the constructive fragment of mathematics.
2014-01-31 04:53:26	sure	a kind of modified epistemic logic
2014-01-31 04:53:44	sure	the problem of classical mathematics is that iti s only interested in atemporal truth
2014-01-31 04:53:49	sure	ie, with "properties" that commutes with everyone
2014-01-31 04:53:59	sure	a "quantum mathematics", with a dynamical logic
2014-01-31 04:54:09	sure	where some properties are incompatible at some time, where results don't commute
2014-01-31 04:54:14	sure	would be much deeper
2014-01-31 04:54:20	sure	and classica mathematics would be the center of that
2014-01-31 04:54:27	sure	"what commutes with everyone"
2014-01-31 04:54:48	Cale	I haven't yet been convinced that we need a notion of time down at the level of our logic, but perhaps.
2014-01-31 04:54:59	sure	linear logic puts a dynamic
2014-01-31 04:55:11	sure	the linear implication "eats" the premice and give you the results
2014-01-31 04:55:22	Cale	(in any case, it's worth studying such things, and how we can embed them as modalities into our more general logics)

2014-01-31 04:56:10	sure	well
2014-01-31 04:56:14	sure	classical logic isn't more general
2014-01-31 04:56:22	sure	the more general logic is the one that allows non commutative "truthes"
2014-01-31 04:56:37	Cale	Well, okay
2014-01-31 04:56:39	sure	classical logic is embed inside that
2014-01-31 04:56:41	sure	as the "center" of it
2014-01-31 04:56:46	sure	what commutes with everyone
2014-01-31 04:57:03	Cale	Yeah, I suppose I didn't mean general in the formal sense :)
2014-01-31 04:57:07	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 04:57:26	sure	i don't know why mathematicians want to keep their classical logic with axiom of choice and stuff
2014-01-31 04:57:41	sure	considering there are a LOTS of new results and funny thing to discover in "non commutative logic"
2014-01-31 04:57:51	Cale	Well, the axiom of choice is actually a very natural thing to expect in many ways
2014-01-31 04:58:03	sure	well, if you're formalist yes
2014-01-31 04:58:14	sure	if you're constructivist, even the real are hard to understand
2014-01-31 04:58:25	Cale	Yes, you can't compute what it gives you, but somehow it feels natural that products of nonempty sets should be inhabited.
2014-01-31 04:58:40	sure	what does a product of uncountable set means ?
2014-01-31 04:58:43	sure	of course ZF tells you
2014-01-31 04:58:49	sure	but i can't make sense of that "philosophicall"
2014-01-31 04:58:56	sure	sorry
2014-01-31 04:59:00	sure	what does an uncontable product of set means
2014-01-31 04:59:01	sure	this way
2014-01-31 04:59:02	sure	:>
2014-01-31 04:59:08	Cale	Note that there are products of uncountably infinite families of sets even in constructive mathematics
2014-01-31 04:59:18	Cale	and frequently they'll even be provably inhabited
2014-01-31 04:59:31	sure	the point is, you can construct them
2014-01-31 04:59:35	sure	so you're convinced that they exist
2014-01-31 04:59:44	sure	constructing is a way to cnvince you
2014-01-31 04:59:51	sure	truth is not accessible to us, only what is provable is
2014-01-31 04:59:57	sure	so we need to be "convined"
2014-01-31 04:59:58	sure	+c
2014-01-31 05:00:23	Cale	Well, I'm a formalist, so truth is what we make it, as far as I'm concerned.
2014-01-31 05:00:27	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:00:28	sure	ye
2014-01-31 05:00:30	sure	you're consistent
2014-01-31 05:00:30	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:00:56	Cale	But we can have different notions of truth, and certainly, constructibility is a very useful one to keep at hand.
2014-01-31 05:01:17	sure	just one question
2014-01-31 05:01:25	sure	can a formalist be platonician ?
2014-01-31 05:01:30	sure	or its just contradictory
2014-01-31 05:01:39	Cale	Maybe, but I'm extremely opposed to Platonism.
2014-01-31 05:01:47	sure	yes, thats what i think

2014-01-31 05:02:18	Cale	Platonism feels like religion to me
2014-01-31 05:02:23	sure	well, it is
2014-01-31 05:02:28	sure	but there's no good science without beliefs

2014-01-31 05:02:33	sure	n
2014-01-31 05:02:49	sure	as a physicit, i need to believe in the principle i use
2014-01-31 05:02:51	Cale	Occam's Razor is important to me
2014-01-31 05:02:53	sure	as a "religion" almost
2014-01-31 05:02:54	ReinH	and now we're talking about *extremely* abstract nonsense, I guess.

2014-01-31 05:03:28	sure	i believe in the theories, not the models
2014-01-31 05:03:43	Cale	sure: You just have to follow the scientific method and see where it gets you
2014-01-31 05:03:48	sure	ahah no
2014-01-31 05:03:56	sure	to you, its like nothing has an absolute meaning

2014-01-31 05:05:11	sure	a theory in physics is like saying "A category is made of a collection of ..."
2014-01-31 05:05:14	sure	its totally implicit
2014-01-31 05:05:16	sure	you have principle
2014-01-31 05:05:18	ReinH	...
2014-01-31 05:05:20	sure	and it tells you what are the "objects"
2014-01-31 05:05:34	sure	a model in physics, would be a concrete category like Set
2014-01-31 05:05:39	sure	something explicited
2014-01-31 05:05:44	sure	where yoiu "know" what are the objects and the arrows
2014-01-31 05:05:50	sure	but a model can be wrong
2014-01-31 05:05:59	sure	yet the theoretical framework a good one
2014-01-31 05:06:02	ReinH	Let's not use the word "theory" when we mean, perhaps, "axiomatic system"?
2014-01-31 05:06:24	ReinH	And I don't think you're using the word "model" in the same way we are either.
2014-01-31 05:06:26	sure	well, a physical theory is not just an axiomatic system
2014-01-31 05:07:00	sure	you have to give a "map" that takes some quantity and gives you explicit perdiction
2014-01-31 05:07:08	sure	this map goes from the "set" of models
2014-01-31 05:07:13	sure	to the set of predictions
2014-01-31 05:07:15	sure	in some sense
2014-01-31 05:07:19	Cale	I'm using the term "physical model" to mean an axiomatic system together with a means of extracting predictions from the theorems of that system.
2014-01-31 05:07:35	ReinH	Wait, why are we talking about physics now? Because Cale said "physical model"?
2014-01-31 05:07:37	sure	Cale: there are two level of predictions in physics, as there are in maths
2014-01-31 05:08:17	Cale	For me, science is fundamentally about making predictions. Models are good if they make predictions which are successful, and if they make predictions which are incorrect, then they are bad.
2014-01-31 05:08:22	Cale	This is different from mathematics
2014-01-31 05:08:37	sure	again, there are two level in physics
2014-01-31 05:08:52	sure	the level of the theory, which is a framework, and the model that BELONGS to the theory, and makes prediction
2014-01-31 05:08:57	sure	a model can be false, it doesn't tell you that th theory is
2014-01-31 05:08:59	ReinH	Ok, I'll pop back by later to see if anyone wants to talk about category theory :)
2014-01-31 05:09:05	sure	ahah ReinH
2014-01-31 05:09:08	sure	we just did for hours
2014-01-31 05:09:09	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:09:11	Cale	ReinH: What did you want to talk about?
2014-01-31 05:09:13	ReinH	and I missed it :)
2014-01-31 05:09:45	Cale	sure: If your theory doesn't make predictions, it's not science, as far as I'm concerned.
2014-01-31 05:09:51	ReinH	Cale: well, we could talk about (a) category of proofs. And its relationship to lattice-like structures. I think they're poset categories, right?
2014-01-31 05:10:12	Cale	Categories of proofs are not poset (or even preorder) categories
2014-01-31 05:10:22	sure	Cale: the theory can make universal predictions, in its principle or what are a logical consequences of it, but it won't tell you "such systems behave like that" (you ened an explicit model for that)
2014-01-31 05:10:25	ReinH	alrighty
2014-01-31 05:10:26	Cale	Categories of provability are preorder categories
2014-01-31 05:10:31	ReinH	ah yes
2014-01-31 05:10:56	Cale	(and still not usually posets, unless you do something to take equivalence classes)
2014-01-31 05:12:04	Cale	sure: Anyway, it's totally okay to do formal stuff which is detached from prediction, and that's what I'd tend to simply refer to as mathematics.
2014-01-31 05:12:28	Cale	sure: Yes, it might have an eye toward being useful to physics, but it's not physics unless you can get concrete predictions out of it somehow.
2014-01-31 05:12:39	sure	Cale: this is why someone has to theorizes what it means to be a physical theory
2014-01-31 05:13:04	sure	well, if you can predict that with your definition of physical theory, that are uncomputable phenomenon for example
2014-01-31 05:13:12	sure	this would be a prediction ;)
2014-01-31 05:13:18	sure	"physics is incomplete"
2014-01-31 05:13:26	Cale	sure: I would be extremely in favour of a physics which was more explicit about exactly how predictions are to be extracted from the formalism.
2014-01-31 05:14:16	Cale	sure: In fact, I even consider Newtonian mechanics to be a bit deficient in that regard.
2014-01-31 05:14:30	sure	to be incomplete in this sense ?
2014-01-31 05:14:38	sure	do you have an explicit example ?
2014-01-31 05:14:47	sure	or about predictions
2014-01-31 05:15:16	Cale	I mean, when people draw those diagrams on the blackboard with various bodies connected by string and springs and so on
2014-01-31 05:15:31	Cale	It's typically not completely formalised what can go there :)
2014-01-31 05:15:35	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:15:38	sure	this is modelization
2014-01-31 05:15:42	sure	not newtonian mechanics
2014-01-31 05:15:43	sure	but yes
2014-01-31 05:15:48	sure	one has to say "what it means to be a model"
2014-01-31 05:15:55	sure	"inside a physical theory"
2014-01-31 05:15:59	sure	so "what it means to be a physical theory"
2014-01-31 05:16:02	sure	i totally agree
2014-01-31 05:16:47	Cale	(though computer programs implementing such things can be considered to be formalisations of that, I suppose)
2014-01-31 05:17:02	sure	well you know Cale, in physics
2014-01-31 05:17:04	Cale	(it's just that they're typically messy and not easily studied directly)
2014-01-31 05:17:07	sure	we only have 4 or 5 theoretical framework
2014-01-31 05:17:19	sure	the rest is modelisation
2014-01-31 05:19:48	sure	moreover
2014-01-31 05:19:55	sure	a question i would like to answer
2014-01-31 05:20:01	sure	"is physics invariant with change of logic ?"
2014-01-31 05:20:10	sure	i'm sure the answer is no
2014-01-31 05:20:11	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:20:20	Cale	Well, okay. I think it would be worthwhile to *do away* with the distinction that you're making, by building the mechanism for posing physical conditions and computing the predictions which follow from them into the formal system.
2014-01-31 05:20:54	Eduard_Munteanu	Logic transcends physics, not the other way around, to say so.
2014-01-31 05:21:00	Cale	sure: I'm not sure that question is even well-posed :)
2014-01-31 05:21:09	sure	physics as the scienc
2014-01-31 05:21:09	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:21:12	sure	not the nature
2014-01-31 05:21:12	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:22:12	Cale	Well, if you change the underlying logic, it becomes awfully hard to compare the results you get in one logic with the results you get in another, because often changes to the logic can mean that the "same" statements can mean something completely different.
2014-01-31 05:22:24	sure	thats true
2014-01-31 05:22:42	Cale	For example, if you're naive about how you translate the axiom of choice into constructive mathematics, you end up with a statement which is trivially true :)
2014-01-31 05:22:51	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:22:59	sure	well, thats the problem of interpretation
2014-01-31 05:23:01	sure	when you do a theory
2014-01-31 05:23:08	sure	you're talking about something abstract that "means" something
2014-01-31 05:23:12	sure	then you have to identify a real object
2014-01-31 05:23:15	sure	with what you mean
2014-01-31 05:23:17	sure	and see if it "fit"
2014-01-31 05:23:24	sure	thats more a philosophical question
2014-01-31 05:23:26	sure	unsolvable one
2014-01-31 05:23:49	Cale	But yeah, if we were more precise about the way in which our physical systems were machines for computing predictions from specified conditions
2014-01-31 05:23:55	Cale	then we could compare them as programs
2014-01-31 05:24:19	Cale	(provided we could translate the conditions!)
2014-01-31 05:24:41	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:24:43	sure	but again
2014-01-31 05:24:47	sure	physics is not about predictions
2014-01-31 05:24:48	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:24:56	sure	but i know, you're formalist so
2014-01-31 05:25:00	Cale	As far as I'm concerned, that's all it's about
2014-01-31 05:25:03	sure	yes
2014-01-31 05:25:12	sure	to me its about finding a "better" meaning
2014-01-31 05:25:19	sure	in the sense that it is deeper
2014-01-31 05:25:20	Cale	I don't even believe there's anything more than that for it to be about :)
2014-01-31 05:25:25	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:25:33	sure	so you don't believe in consciousness either ?
2014-01-31 05:25:35	sure	i mean
2014-01-31 05:25:38	sure	we're just machine ? ;)
2014-01-31 05:26:05	Cale	We're machines to the extent that considering us as such is useful to predict how we work.
2014-01-31 05:26:12	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:26:18	sure	so you really don't want to believe something a bit "hard"
2014-01-31 05:26:39	sure	you're too cautious imo
2014-01-31 05:26:40	sure	:>
2014-01-31 05:27:14	ReinH	Cautiousness of this sort seems to me like a desirable quality for a scientist...
2014-01-31 05:27:19	Cale	How we decide on what is true at the end of the day is a matter of usefulness, and is inherently subjective. Any scrap of objectivity in it comes from agreement on what it means to be useful :)
2014-01-31 05:27:43	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:27:46	sure	again i diagree
2014-01-31 05:27:48	sure	i would say
2014-01-31 05:27:52	sure	i don't care about truth
2014-01-31 05:27:55	sure	i care about meaning ;)
2014-01-31 05:28:17	ReinH	I have no idea what those words mean.
2014-01-31 05:29:17	ReinH	Well I do, but it's "whatever the speaker intends them to mean" ;)
2014-01-31 05:29:23	sure	ahah
2014-01-31 05:29:33	sure	what does meaning mean ?
2014-01-31 05:29:34	sure	:}}
2014-01-31 05:29:42	ReinH	It's subjective turtles all the way down
2014-01-31 05:29:50	ReinH	swimming in a sea of subjectivity
2014-01-31 05:30:49	ReinH	Words like "truth" and "meaning" only have meaning (sigh) within some axiomatic system. If you want to call using that axiomatic system "believing in it" then so be it.
2014-01-31 05:31:24	sure	well, some existential truth are "transcending" the relative nature of truth
2014-01-31 05:31:31	sure	like "it is true that this axiomatic system is consistent"
2014-01-31 05:31:35	sure	you can "believe" in such truth
2014-01-31 05:31:38	sure	even though you can't prove it
2014-01-31 05:31:58	ReinH	I wouldn't say I "believe" in it.
2014-01-31 05:32:06	Cale	Given that what's useful can seemingly vary quite a lot from situation to situation and person to person, I don't like to commit myself to insisting on any one system of reasoning, or to thinking that there might be some objective ideal system which would always produce better results (whatever that means!) than any other.
2014-01-31 05:32:06	ReinH	I would say I find it useful to operate under that assumption
2014-01-31 05:32:35	ReinH	one can derive interesting results in ZFC without "believing" that it is "true" in any metaphysical sense
2014-01-31 05:32:46	Cale	We can compare our methods of reaching conclusions and see what works in practice, and work on the better ones and discard the things which don't seem to work
2014-01-31 05:32:56	Cale	all without assuming that there's some single truth to things
2014-01-31 05:32:57	sure	thats true ReinH but when yoiu work in it you have to "believe" in it in some sense
2014-01-31 05:33:06	sure	Cale: well, then there's no meaning for you
2014-01-31 05:33:11	ReinH	Sure, but that sense isn't the one you seem to want it to be :)
2014-01-31 05:33:35	sure	thats true ;>
2014-01-31 05:34:06	ReinH	If you want to call modus ponens a form of "believing in Q" then ok :)
2014-01-31 05:34:07	Cale	Everything is a big game to me, even when it's a useful game :)
2014-01-31 05:34:34	sure	to me, there are some objects that exist, and some absolute meaning one can put of them, like, point of views
2014-01-31 05:34:42	sure	and an axiomatic system is a point of view on those objects
2014-01-31 05:35:02	ReinH	but you can have axiomatic systems that are totally inconsistent with "the real world"
2014-01-31 05:35:04	sure	and there are "better" dscription of them :>
2014-01-31 05:35:06	ReinH	in fact you almost always do
2014-01-31 05:35:20	Cale	sure: I can see why you might want to make assumptions like that. I just don't like committing myself to one particular way of looking at things at a foundational level like that.
2014-01-31 05:35:30	sure	yes, but the objects i'm talking about are abstract ReinH
2014-01-31 05:35:40	Cale	I prefer to put all my assumptions about what exists into relative contexts.
2014-01-31 05:35:54	sure	Cale: well, your context is what i would call "a question"
2014-01-31 05:35:57	ReinH	I like my carts firmly affixed to the rear of my horses :)
2014-01-31 05:36:45	sure	but i would also add Cale, thatn ot all question have the same value
2014-01-31 05:36:49	sure	so in some sense
2014-01-31 05:36:52	ReinH	or possibly affixed by some sort of yoke system but you get the point
2014-01-31 05:36:54	sure	i'm a lot "absolutist" ahah

2014-01-31 16:50:27	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:30:28] thats true
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:30:36] and here the way to do it is the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:35:59] By a similar argument, |f| surjective => f epic will commonly be the case. (That is, whenever |g_1| = |g_2| implies g_1 = g_2)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:36:27] yes, so this is the structure that breaks the <= ide
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:36:28] side
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:39:13] So, let's look at the other way. Suppose that f is monic. We have that for any g_1 and g_2 such that f . g_1 = f . g_2, that g_1 = g_2. However, this *doesn't* tell us that f is injective. If we apply the forgetful functor to things we can get that if |f| . |g_1| = |f| . |g_2| then |g_1| = |g_2|, but that only tells us about functions which happened to come from arrows under our forgetful functor.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:40:37] yes, you don't know about the other ones
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:40:50] but in Mon, if f is monic, |f| is injective right ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:41:07] because of UMP
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:42:15] Well, because there's a free monoid on one generator we can use to separate them via a sneaky argument.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:42:31] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:43:59] So, whenever there's this free/forgetful pairing, a similar argument can typically be made to work
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:44:34] But we won't generally have some kind of universal widget to characterise maps from the other side.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:44:57] from set to structure
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:44:59] you mean?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:45:43] because clearly here you have what i mean by "diagramatic characterization"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:45:45] with UMP
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:45:46] For example, monoid homomorphisms A -> B are determined by their composites with maps from the free monoid on one generator to A, i.e. F(1) -> A
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:46:36] However, there's no monoid U such that knowing the composites of f: A -> B with all the maps B -> U will tell us what f was
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:47:27] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:47:32] thats what you call "the other side"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:47:42] but in some sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:47:53] in Sets, knowing all the composites with 1 -> A
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:47:54] So we can't make the analogous sneaky argument for monoids
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:48:12] is equivalent in structures with having the ump property
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:48:17] for free monoid with one generator
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:48:50] and i bet this holds in Grp, Ring, and so on
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:48:59] Yeah, if you can get something which has the universal property of a free object on one generator, then that argument will go through
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:08] ok group works then
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:49:10] It's always going to be somewhat specific to the category you're working with
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:24] yes but you have your caracterisation
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:49:27] There are some wide classes of categories we could make this work in
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:32] its "having the ump of free object with one generator"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:49:39] but you haven't read enough of Awodey to understand those yet :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:44] ahah yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:55] i took the 2nd edition btw Cale
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:49:58] not the one you gave me
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:50:01] its better
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:50:22] Oh, I didn't know there was another edition
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:54:37] sure: So, the thing which *really* characterises the forgetful functor in general is that it's "right adjoint" to the free functor
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:55:36] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:55:54] i.e. If F: Set -> Mon is the free monoid functor, and |-|: Mon -> Set is the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:56:36] Then we have that monoid homomorphisms FX -> M are in exact correspondence with functions X -> |M|
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:57:00] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:57:06] which is the UMP
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[03:57:09] yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:57:11] its a formulation of the ump
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:57:12] i see
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:58:06] you make me want to understand that asap
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:58:06] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:58:30] adjoint: page 200
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[03:58:31] : (
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:00:32] Well, almost the entire rest of the book (and classical category theory done around the 1960's) is built up around trying to express what universal mapping properties "are"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:00:49] in more and more general ways
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:00:53] i see
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:06:47] Now, in the category of sets, the trick to prove that every epimorphism f: X -> Y is surjective is to compose it with both g_1: Y -> 2 which acts by g_1(y) = 1 if y is in f(X), and g_1(y) = 0 otherwise, and g_2: Y -> 2 which is just the constant function giving 1
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:07:47] Then we see that (g_1 . f)(x) = g_1(f(x)) = 1, and (g_2 . f)(x) = g_2(f(x)) = 1 for every x in X, so g_1 . f = g_2 . f
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:08:03] and by f being epic, we have g_1 = g_2
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:08:31] But this means that for every y in Y, g_1(y) = 1, so y is in f(X).
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:08:55] thus, f is surjective
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:08:58] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:09:01] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:09:05] nice proof
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:09:06] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:11:27] To be able to generalise that to another category, we need a suitable generalisation of 2.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:11:39] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:11:47] that is not "too constrained" by the structure
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:11:49] as for 1
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:11:54] thats it ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:12:00] (for arrows)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:12:25] The free monoid functor was a *left* adjoint to the forgetful functor. (i.e. the forgetful functor was right adjoint to it)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:12:52] It turns out the right thing to make this argument work is that we need a *right* adjoint to the forgetful functor
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:13:22] so basically, the characterisation i was looking for
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:13:25] Or rather to lift the argument to another category the way we did with monoids and the free/forgetful thing
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:13:29] is given by the existence of an adjoint
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:13:33] yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:13:33] a right adjoint
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:13:35] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:14:06] but its weird because you don't need the Op category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:14:12] For example, in the category of topological spaces, the forgetful functor Top -> Set has both a left and right adjoint
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:14:14] whereas the symmetry on set holds in op
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:14:23] The left adjoint makes the discrete topology on a set
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:14:31] the right adjoint makes the indiscrete topology
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:14:55] so the adjoint
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:14:58] "lift" up the structure
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:14:58] Using the indiscrete topology on 2 = {0,1}
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:15:01] the set to the structure
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:15:27] We can make a similar argument go through
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:16:30] Using the indiscrete topology here is important, because if we tried to use the discrete topology on {0,1}, then the map g_1 we considered before might not be continuous
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:16:53] (i.e. the map which sends the range of f to 1 and everything else to 0)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:17:25] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:17:29] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:17:33] so you can gneralize exactly the same prof
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:17:42] so in Top, epic <=> surjective
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:17:53] yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:18:15] what about the concept of site ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:18:24] This also works out in some categories where we don't get a right adjoint to the forgetful functor, for various other reasons, but that's a pretty general way to get it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:19:13] For example, in the category of groups, this is quite tricky iirc.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:30] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:32] so it not universal
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:44] so the existence of an adjoint (right)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:47] is just a sufficient condition
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:50] its not even necessary
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:19:52] yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:58] so its not a "good" concept
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:19:58] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:20:08] (i mean, it is, but its not perfect)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:20:17] The same thing is true on the other side with monomorphisms
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:20:42] If our forgetful functor doesn't have a left adjoint, then that argument won't work
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:21:02] i guess this concept of adjoint is what i was looking for
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:21:04] (but usually we wouldn't call something a forgetful functor unless it had a left adjoint)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:21:13] (but of course i wouldn't find it alone)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:21:44] so maybe there's a better concept to characterise the equivalence between epic and monic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:21:51] that is also a necessary condition
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:22:03] erm
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:22:06] epic and surjective sorry
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:22:09] In general, this question gets so hairy, that I doubt there's any simple necessary and sufficient condition.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:22:20] well, you have to be creative ,}
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:22:49] if there is none, it means the question "why epic is equivalent to surjective in some case and not other ?" is a bad question
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:22:49] Especially characterising the epimorphisms of arbitrary categories tends to get ridiculously hard
2014-01-31 16:50:27	tomprince	[04:23:40] sure: It isn't a bad question. It just doesn't have a simple answer.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:24:05] http://mathoverflow.net/questions/109/what-do-epimorphisms-of-commutative-rings-look-like
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:24:11] tomprince: so its a bad question ;}
2014-01-31 16:50:27	tomprince	[04:25:03] No. There are is lots of interesting mathematics to explore/discover trying to answer. So it isn't a bad question.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:25:28] it is a bad question in the sense that there might be a better question to ask and answer tomprince
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:25:31] a better "view point"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	tomprince	[04:25:52] That doesn't make bad.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:25:57] sure: It's a very good question in general what the epimorphisms or monomorphisms in a category are, precisely *because* it tells you something nontrivial about your category.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:10] yes, like the existence of adjoints
2014-01-31 16:50:27	tomprince	[04:26:12] Things are typically black and white.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:13] as you told me
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:26:19] If they were always easily characterised, then it would be a boring question :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:23] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:27] thats true too
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:28] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:34] oh by the way
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:36] yesterday
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:26:46] i was looking for a characterization of what it is to be a category, inside a category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:26:58] Ah, there are some ways to do that :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	tomprince	[04:27:01] Just because there isn't a good answer, doesn't mean that a question is bad. In fact, in mathematics, you could argue that that is part of the definition of a *good* question.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:27:02] and someone (was it you tomprince?) refered me to the concept of inertal category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:27:26] so i checked it today, but is there a way to express the product from the "new" composite map "c" from C_1xC_1 purely internaly ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:27:42] ie, only with Id_A, °, Obj(C), Arw(C) where C is the ambient category ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:28:05] (internal category sory)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:28:23] sure: You generally need to have pullbacks to be able to express when arrows are composable
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:28:29] yes i saw that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:28:32] If that's what you're asking
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:28:39] but its ok, you can "assume" you have enough pullbacks
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:28:47] they are here, in the category ambient
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:28:53] but what about C_1xC_1 ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:29:02] is it an object of the ambient category ? if yes, how to know if its there ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:29:34] Well, C_1 x C_1 may exist (it probably does in any category which also has all the pullbacks you need, unless something strange is taking place)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:29:47] But it expresses something which isn't so important
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:30:09] you need it in order to have a composite map right ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:30:11] It's an object which represents arbitrary pairs of arrows which might not line up
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:30:42] In order to have a composite map, you need the pullback of C_1 and C_1 along the source and target maps to C_0
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:14] so pullbacks ensure the existnce of C_1xC_1 ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:31:17] This is often just written C_1 x_(C_0) C_1, to give the impression that it has something to do with the product of C_1 and C_1
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:23] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:24] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:28] so i didn't understand this notation
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:31:33] If you have all pullbacks and you have a terminal object, then you have all products.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:40] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:31:59] well, thats really elegant
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:32:05] to characterize what it is to be a category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:32:10] inside category theory itself
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:32:11] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:32:19] There's also lots of other fun ways to do it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:32:32] i saw that you can do the same with functors
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:32:41] so i guess you can also code lots of funny things internally
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:32:50] There's a 2-category of spans of sets, where a span of sets is a diagram which looks like  A <- S -> B
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:33:53] and you define a composite of spans A <- S_1 -> B and B <- S_2 -> C by taking a pullback of the diagram S_1 -> B <- S_2
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:33:59] and then composing down the sides
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:34:42] and given two spans with the same "domain" and "codomain": say A <- S_1 -> B and A <- S_2 -> B
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:34:54] then you can define maps between them as functions S_1 -> S_2 which make the diagram commute
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:35:05] and that gets you a 2-category structure
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:35:09] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:35:27] this reminds me of the concept of slice category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:35:34] how you "transport" diagrams
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:35:35] For any 2-category, you can talk about monads *in* that category
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:35:37] to create arrows
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:36:08] what's a monad ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:36:18] oh, you haven't got to those yet :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:36:20] right
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:36:35] i'm at chapter 2 of awodey
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:36:38] I suppose it would be a bit awkward to talk about this generalisation of them :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:36:42] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:36:56] Yeah, I was sort of assuming that you were coming from Haskell or something.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:37:03] ahah no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:37:05] i'm beginner
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:37:06] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[04:37:22] Indeed, if you talk CT in #haskell, chances are you know about monads already. :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:37:33] (People who learn category theory because of functional programming tend to learn everything in a weird order)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:37:43] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:37:47] i learn it for physics :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:37:53] ah, okay
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:38:06] i think its the future
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:38:09] but nobody agrees with me
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:38:09] :<
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:38:15] Well, it's the present
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:38:18] true
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:38:27] At least, of mathematics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:38:40] Category theoretical notation has worked its way into pretty much every corner of mathematics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:38:54] so its a "must know" theory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ystael	[04:39:09] well, if you do PDE or something, you might still be mostly cheerfully oblivious :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:39:23] yeah, there are some areas of analysis where you see a bit less of it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:40:00] But it's amazing to think that before CT came along, people didn't write f: A -> B
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:40:09] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[04:40:10] Oh?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:40:14] i didn't know that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:40:15] and if you go look at old books, they really didn't!
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:40:46] what interests me is also the links of CT with fundation of mathematics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:40:49] Though you did see some odd things like f: A subset B
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:40:56] like, topos and stuff, i would like to understand them :<
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[04:41:23] sure: Baez worked on getting CT to express things physics, btw.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:41:31] sure: Lately I've been drinking the homotopy type theory kool-aid pretty hard.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:41:52] Eduard_Munteanu: yes i heard about that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:41:55] but he is doing higher categories
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[04:43:13] sure: http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:43:46] sure: I think that ultimately constructive mathematics might be more appropriate for physics. Constructive (intuitionist) logic is more natural from a category theoretical perspective.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:44:16] There are a bunch of foundational things which worry me about the present state of physics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:45:49] Cale: yes, i'm "intuitionist" anyway
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:46:02] well there should be a theory of what is a physical theory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:46:09] this is missing
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:46:37] I'm actually not, I'm more of a formalist, but I think intuitionist logic and constructive mathematics are useful, so we should study them :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:00] i would describe me as
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[04:47:01] Yes, leave sphere multiplication to religion or politics. :P
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:05] an "dynamical intuitionist"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:10] or "interationist"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:47:15] One of my concerns with the state of physics is just a social thing: physicists tend to be quite lax when it comes to formalising things mathematically.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:29] i think physics needs a logif of truth/knowledge that is dyamical in the sense of linear logic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:42] yes Cale, because they don't want to put the effort into learning the maths
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:45] and i hate that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:49] most of them are doing shitty physics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:47:51] for example QFT
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:47:58] I think this is a dangerous thing: in order to be meaningful, our physical models need to predict some things and not others.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:48:12] you have a rigorous formulation (AQF) that proves that what physicist do and "hope" with usual QFT is meaningless
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:48:27] If by accident, you introduce a contradiction into your mathematics, then logic will let you prove (or predict!) anything
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:48:32] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:48:34] totally
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:48:39] this is the case with renormalization
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:48:49] renormalization is something i never understood (and never will)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:49:46] but its a matter of effort
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:49:53] most physicists don't want to work hard
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:49:57] But if something you're doing to calculate predictions is working, despite not actually following the usual rules, we should certainly figure out what the computations are that you're doing and formulate the theory in terms of those.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:49:59] they don't want to lern maths
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:50:45] I suppose the other thing which is important about constructive mathematics is that you're guaranteed in some ways to be able to compute things.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:51:24] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:51:34] and thats what you want in physics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:51:35] With classical mathematics, LEM and the axiom of choice can destroy the computational nature of results, and you might end up with a physical theory which nonetheless you cannot compute anything it predicts.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:51:41] having a theory in which you can formulate models where things are computable
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:51:54] LEM = ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:51:59] Law of excluded middle
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:03] oh yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:04] true
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:26] thats why intuitionism is more "physical"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:27] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:35] you are ony convinced of what you can compute and express explicitly
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:52:40] otherwise you don't conclude anything
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:08] but the "good" logic of physics isn ot classical
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:19] i think it is something dynamical and related to "knowledge"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:53:25] However, I think classical mathematics is still a) really fun to do, and b) can be carried out in a way that the results are still useful even if all the applications are making use of the constructive fragment of mathematics.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:26] a kind of modified epistemic logic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:44] the problem of classical mathematics is that iti s only interested in atemporal truth
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:49] ie, with "properties" that commutes with everyone
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:53:59] a "quantum mathematics", with a dynamical logic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:54:09] where some properties are incompatible at some time, where results don't commute
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:54:14] would be much deeper
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:54:20] and classica mathematics would be the center of that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:54:27] "what commutes with everyone"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:54:48] I haven't yet been convinced that we need a notion of time down at the level of our logic, but perhaps.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:54:59] linear logic puts a dynamic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:55:11] the linear implication "eats" the premice and give you the results
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:55:22] (in any case, it's worth studying such things, and how we can embed them as modalities into our more general logics)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:10] well
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:14] classical logic isn't more general
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:22] the more general logic is the one that allows non commutative "truthes"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:56:37] Well, okay
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:39] classical logic is embed inside that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:41] as the "center" of it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:56:46] what commutes with everyone
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:57:03] Yeah, I suppose I didn't mean general in the formal sense :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:57:07] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:57:26] i don't know why mathematicians want to keep their classical logic with axiom of choice and stuff
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:57:41] considering there are a LOTS of new results and funny thing to discover in "non commutative logic"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:57:51] Well, the axiom of choice is actually a very natural thing to expect in many ways
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:03] well, if you're formalist yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:14] if you're constructivist, even the real are hard to understand
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:58:25] Yes, you can't compute what it gives you, but somehow it feels natural that products of nonempty sets should be inhabited.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:40] what does a product of uncountable set means ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:43] of course ZF tells you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:49] but i can't make sense of that "philosophicall"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:58:56] sorry
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:00] what does an uncontable product of set means
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:01] this way
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:02] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:59:08] Note that there are products of uncountably infinite families of sets even in constructive mathematics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[04:59:18] and frequently they'll even be provably inhabited
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:31] the point is, you can construct them
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:35] so you're convinced that they exist
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:44] constructing is a way to cnvince you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:51] truth is not accessible to us, only what is provable is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:57] so we need to be "convined"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[04:59:58] +c
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:00:23] Well, I'm a formalist, so truth is what we make it, as far as I'm concerned.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:00:27] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:00:28] ye
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:00:30] you're consistent
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:00:30] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:00:56] But we can have different notions of truth, and certainly, constructibility is a very useful one to keep at hand.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:17] just one question
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:25] can a formalist be platonician ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:30] or its just contradictory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:01:39] Maybe, but I'm extremely opposed to Platonism.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:47] yes, thats what i think
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:54] i'm extremely opposed to non platonism
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:01:55] ;>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:02:18] Platonism feels like religion to me
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:23] well, it is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:28] but there's no good science without beliefs
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:33] thats what i thik
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:33] n
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:49] as a physicit, i need to believe in the principle i use
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:02:51] Occam's Razor is important to me
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:53] as a "religion" almost
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:02:54] and now we're talking about *extremely* abstract nonsense, I guess.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:02:56] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:02:59] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:03:20] sure: I don't think you have to *believe* in your models
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:03:28] i believe in the theories, not the models
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:03:43] sure: You just have to follow the scientific method and see where it gets you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:03:48] ahah no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:03:56] to you, its like nothing has an absolute meaning
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:03:56] I'm a utilitarian. I don't "believe" in them, they're either more or less useful.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:11] to me, there are some kind of absolute meaning
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:04:18] I don't believe in an objective notion of reality.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:22] and the goal of the physicist (or mathematician), i to find the most meaningful ones
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:30] well, i'm neither a realist
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:37] but i believe in an objective notion of principles, and relations
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:39] structur
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:04:43] Of course, *when applying a physical model*, I will happily say that the universe in that model "exists"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:04:50] But it's relative to that model :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:53] again
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:04:56] a model is not a theory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:11] a theory in physics is like saying "A category is made of a collection of ..."
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:14] its totally implicit
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:16] you have principle
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:05:18] ...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:20] and it tells you what are the "objects"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:34] a model in physics, would be a concrete category like Set
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:39] something explicited
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:44] where yoiu "know" what are the objects and the arrows
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:50] but a model can be wrong
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:05:59] yet the theoretical framework a good one
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:06:02] Let's not use the word "theory" when we mean, perhaps, "axiomatic system"?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:06:24] And I don't think you're using the word "model" in the same way we are either.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:06:26] well, a physical theory is not just an axiomatic system
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:07:00] you have to give a "map" that takes some quantity and gives you explicit perdiction
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:07:08] this map goes from the "set" of models
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:07:13] to the set of predictions
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:07:15] in some sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:07:19] I'm using the term "physical model" to mean an axiomatic system together with a means of extracting predictions from the theorems of that system.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:07:35] Wait, why are we talking about physics now? Because Cale said "physical model"?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:07:37] Cale: there are two level of predictions in physics, as there are in maths
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:08:17] For me, science is fundamentally about making predictions. Models are good if they make predictions which are successful, and if they make predictions which are incorrect, then they are bad.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:08:22] This is different from mathematics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:08:37] again, there are two level in physics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:08:52] the level of the theory, which is a framework, and the model that BELONGS to the theory, and makes prediction
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:08:57] a model can be false, it doesn't tell you that th theory is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:08:59] Ok, I'll pop back by later to see if anyone wants to talk about category theory :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:09:05] ahah ReinH
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:09:08] we just did for hours
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:09:09] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:09:11] ReinH: What did you want to talk about?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:09:13] and I missed it :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:09:45] sure: If your theory doesn't make predictions, it's not science, as far as I'm concerned.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:09:51] Cale: well, we could talk about (a) category of proofs. And its relationship to lattice-like structures. I think they're poset categories, right?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:10:12] Categories of proofs are not poset (or even preorder) categories
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:10:22] Cale: the theory can make universal predictions, in its principle or what are a logical consequences of it, but it won't tell you "such systems behave like that" (you ened an explicit model for that)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:10:25] alrighty
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:10:26] Categories of provability are preorder categories
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:10:31] ah yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:10:56] (and still not usually posets, unless you do something to take equivalence classes)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:12:04] sure: Anyway, it's totally okay to do formal stuff which is detached from prediction, and that's what I'd tend to simply refer to as mathematics.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:12:28] sure: Yes, it might have an eye toward being useful to physics, but it's not physics unless you can get concrete predictions out of it somehow.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:12:39] Cale: this is why someone has to theorizes what it means to be a physical theory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:13:04] well, if you can predict that with your definition of physical theory, that are uncomputable phenomenon for example
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:13:12] this would be a prediction ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:13:18] "physics is incomplete"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:13:26] sure: I would be extremely in favour of a physics which was more explicit about exactly how predictions are to be extracted from the formalism.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:14:16] sure: In fact, I even consider Newtonian mechanics to be a bit deficient in that regard.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:14:30] to be incomplete in this sense ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:14:38] do you have an explicit example ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:14:47] or about predictions
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:15:16] I mean, when people draw those diagrams on the blackboard with various bodies connected by string and springs and so on
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:15:31] It's typically not completely formalised what can go there :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:35] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:38] this is modelization
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:42] not newtonian mechanics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:43] but yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:48] one has to say "what it means to be a model"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:55] "inside a physical theory"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:15:59] so "what it means to be a physical theory"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:16:02] i totally agree
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:16:47] (though computer programs implementing such things can be considered to be formalisations of that, I suppose)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:17:02] well you know Cale, in physics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:17:04] (it's just that they're typically messy and not easily studied directly)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:17:07] we only have 4 or 5 theoretical framework
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:17:19] the rest is modelisation
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:19:48] moreover
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:19:55] a question i would like to answer
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:20:01] "is physics invariant with change of logic ?"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:20:10] i'm sure the answer is no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:20:11] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:20:20] Well, okay. I think it would be worthwhile to *do away* with the distinction that you're making, by building the mechanism for posing physical conditions and computing the predictions which follow from them into the formal system.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Eduard_Munteanu	[05:20:54] Logic transcends physics, not the other way around, to say so.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:21:00] sure: I'm not sure that question is even well-posed :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:21:09] physics as the scienc
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:21:09] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:21:12] not the nature
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:21:12] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:22:12] Well, if you change the underlying logic, it becomes awfully hard to compare the results you get in one logic with the results you get in another, because often changes to the logic can mean that the "same" statements can mean something completely different.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:22:24] thats true
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:22:42] For example, if you're naive about how you translate the axiom of choice into constructive mathematics, you end up with a statement which is trivially true :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:22:51] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:22:59] well, thats the problem of interpretation
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:01] when you do a theory
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:08] you're talking about something abstract that "means" something
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:12] then you have to identify a real object
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:15] with what you mean
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:17] and see if it "fit"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:24] thats more a philosophical question
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:23:26] unsolvable one
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:23:49] But yeah, if we were more precise about the way in which our physical systems were machines for computing predictions from specified conditions
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:23:55] then we could compare them as programs
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:24:19] (provided we could translate the conditions!)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:24:41] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:24:43] but again
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:24:47] physics is not about predictions
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:24:48] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:24:56] but i know, you're formalist so
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:25:00] As far as I'm concerned, that's all it's about
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:03] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:12] to me its about finding a "better" meaning
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:19] in the sense that it is deeper
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:25:20] I don't even believe there's anything more than that for it to be about :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:25] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:33] so you don't believe in consciousness either ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:35] i mean
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:25:38] we're just machine ? ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:26:05] We're machines to the extent that considering us as such is useful to predict how we work.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:26:12] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:26:18] so you really don't want to believe something a bit "hard"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:26:39] you're too cautious imo
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:26:40] :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:27:14] Cautiousness of this sort seems to me like a desirable quality for a scientist...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:27:19] How we decide on what is true at the end of the day is a matter of usefulness, and is inherently subjective. Any scrap of objectivity in it comes from agreement on what it means to be useful :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:27:43] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:27:46] again i diagree
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:27:48] i would say
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:27:52] i don't care about truth
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:27:55] i care about meaning ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:28:17] I have no idea what those words mean.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:29:17] Well I do, but it's "whatever the speaker intends them to mean" ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:29:23] ahah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:29:33] what does meaning mean ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:29:34] :}}
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:29:42] It's subjective turtles all the way down
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:29:50] swimming in a sea of subjectivity
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:30:49] Words like "truth" and "meaning" only have meaning (sigh) within some axiomatic system. If you want to call using that axiomatic system "believing in it" then so be it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:31:24] well, some existential truth are "transcending" the relative nature of truth
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:31:31] like "it is true that this axiomatic system is consistent"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:31:35] you can "believe" in such truth
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:31:38] even though you can't prove it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:31:58] I wouldn't say I "believe" in it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:32:06] Given that what's useful can seemingly vary quite a lot from situation to situation and person to person, I don't like to commit myself to insisting on any one system of reasoning, or to thinking that there might be some objective ideal system which would always produce better results (whatever that means!) than any other.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:32:06] I would say I find it useful to operate under that assumption
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:32:35] one can derive interesting results in ZFC without "believing" that it is "true" in any metaphysical sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:32:46] We can compare our methods of reaching conclusions and see what works in practice, and work on the better ones and discard the things which don't seem to work
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:32:56] all without assuming that there's some single truth to things
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:32:57] thats true ReinH but when yoiu work in it you have to "believe" in it in some sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:33:06] Cale: well, then there's no meaning for you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:33:11] Sure, but that sense isn't the one you seem to want it to be :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:33:35] thats true ;>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:34:06] If you want to call modus ponens a form of "believing in Q" then ok :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:34:07] Everything is a big game to me, even when it's a useful game :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:34:34] to me, there are some objects that exist, and some absolute meaning one can put of them, like, point of views
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:34:42] and an axiomatic system is a point of view on those objects
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:35:02] but you can have axiomatic systems that are totally inconsistent with "the real world"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:35:04] and there are "better" dscription of them :>
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:35:06] in fact you almost always do
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:35:20] sure: I can see why you might want to make assumptions like that. I just don't like committing myself to one particular way of looking at things at a foundational level like that.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:35:30] yes, but the objects i'm talking about are abstract ReinH
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cale	[05:35:40] I prefer to put all my assumptions about what exists into relative contexts.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:35:54] Cale: well, your context is what i would call "a question"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:35:57] I like my carts firmly affixed to the rear of my horses :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:36:45] but i would also add Cale, thatn ot all question have the same value
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:36:49] so in some sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ReinH	[05:36:52] or possibly affixed by some sort of yoke system but you get the point
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sure	[05:36:54] i'm a lot "absolutist" ahah

2014-01-31 23:22:11	sure	I'm trying to show that the product category defined as it is is indeed a product
2014-01-31 23:22:21	sure	but how can i show the uniqueness of the functor injection map ?

2014-01-31 23:30:13	tomprince	The map from A to AxC?
2014-01-31 23:30:18	sure	yes
2014-01-31 23:30:24	tomprince	It isn't unique.
2014-01-31 23:30:25	sure	from X to AxB
2014-01-31 23:30:40	sure	no the <F_1, F_2> map
2014-01-31 23:31:46	tomprince	Well, it is only unique among maps satisfying a certain condition.
2014-01-31 23:32:17	sure	suppose i have constructed AxB, i have the projections map too
2014-01-31 23:32:34	sure	now i take a category X with functor F_1 from X to A and F_2 from X to B
2014-01-31 23:32:48	sure	it is easy to show the commutativity of the diagram for <F_1,F_2> map from X to AxB
2014-01-31 23:32:51	sure	but i can't show the uniqueness
2014-01-31 23:32:55	tomprince	It hinges on what elements of AxB look like, and what you can deduce about an element p of AxB, given F_1(p) and F_2(p)
2014-01-31 23:34:13	sure	ok i guess its trivial if you explicit the object and arrows
2014-01-31 23:34:26	sure	i was trying to do it without components

2014-01-31 23:55:26	tomprince	sure: Typically, when proving something about a particular object, you need to use particular features about that object.
2014-01-31 23:55:32	augur	sure: you can (and usually must) use the details of the definition
2014-01-31 23:55:52	augur	if you define products in way W, you can use the facts about way W to justify the claim that it defines a product
2014-01-31 23:56:03	tomprince	But, once you proven that there exists a product of categories, you can use its abstract definition (which doesn't refer to particulars) to reason about it.
2014-01-31 23:56:22	augur	the CT toolkit only tells you how to think about things that you know beforehand have these properties
2014-01-31 23:56:34	tomprince	But, before you've shown that a particular construction does satisfy some universal property, you do need look at particulars.
2014-01-31 23:56:44	augur	the toolkit doesnt create the properties but merely describes them
2014-01-31 23:58:41	sure	yes you're both right
2014-01-31 23:58:54	sure	you can't stick to the "implicit" framework so obviously i had to explicit things
2014-01-31 23:58:55	sure	thx

2014-02-01 03:35:35	sure	question
2014-02-01 03:35:41	sure	for any arbitrary category
2014-02-01 03:35:46	sure	are all products isomorph ?
2014-02-01 03:36:31	tomprince	2x2 != 3x3
2014-02-01 03:36:41	sure	ahah
2014-02-01 03:36:47	sure	true
2014-02-01 03:37:01	tac	sure: If you have two products for the same pair, they will be isomorphic, yes.
2014-02-01 03:37:11	sure	yes i mean
2014-02-01 03:37:16	sure	for the same pair of objects
2014-02-01 03:37:18	tac	AxB and BxA   in sets  are going to be isomorphic to each other
2014-02-01 03:37:29	sure	even with differents projections ?
2014-02-01 03:37:35	tomprince	It is fairly straightforward to show.
2014-02-01 03:37:37	sure	ok
2014-02-01 03:37:39	sure	i'm going to show it then
2014-02-01 03:37:59	tac	sure: They are isomorphic in the category. But also, as "wedges", they are *uniquely* isomorphic
2014-02-01 03:38:25	sure	ok i see how to prove it
2014-02-01 03:38:34	sure	as usual with UMP
2014-02-01 03:38:39	sure	so everytime one has a UMP
2014-02-01 03:38:47	sure	the "objects" constructed is unique up to isomorphism ?
2014-02-01 03:38:59	tac	pretty much
2014-02-01 03:39:11	sure	what do you mean by wedges ?
2014-02-01 03:39:33	tac	If you have objects A and B fixed
2014-02-01 03:39:36	tomprince	Which is why you can get away with just using the universal property, once you have shown there is an object that satisfies it.
2014-02-01 03:39:53	tac	a "wedge" (or cone) over A and B is an object W together with the two projection maps W -> A and W -> B
2014-02-01 03:40:16	tac	Technically, the product is the whole wedge, not just the underlying object
2014-02-01 03:40:25	sure	ok you mean the diagram A <- W -> B is called a wedge
2014-02-01 03:40:29	sure	yes
2014-02-01 03:40:33	tac	(A wedge might also be written as    (W, π_1, π_2)
2014-02-01 03:40:35	sure	but because they are all isomorphic
2014-02-01 03:40:52	sure	in some sense it is "enough" to write the wedge if yu know it is a product
2014-02-01 03:40:53	sure	right
2014-02-01 03:40:55	tac	The terminal wedge is the product
2014-02-01 03:41:03	tac	there might be more than one terminal wedge
2014-02-01 03:41:03	sure	yes
2014-02-01 03:41:05	-->	NickKidman (~Adium@p3E9E9B72.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-02-01 03:41:16	tac	but because they are terminal, they point at each other with only one arrow
2014-02-01 03:41:17	sure	ah you mean
2014-02-01 03:41:25	sure	the product is a terminal wedge in the category of wedge ?
2014-02-01 03:41:31	tac	yep
2014-02-01 03:41:36	tac	(wedges over A and B)
2014-02-01 03:41:39	sure	up to isomorphism then ?
2014-02-01 03:41:43	sure	wait
2014-02-01 03:41:44	sure	no
2014-02-01 03:41:46	sure	you're right
2014-02-01 03:41:48	tac	You also have "wedge morphisms", which are the dashed arrows you draw.
2014-02-01 03:41:49	sure	i showed it yes
2014-02-01 03:41:51	sure	yes i agree
2014-02-01 03:41:51	sure	:<
2014-02-01 03:41:56	sure	yes sure
2014-02-01 03:41:56	sure	i see
2014-02-01 03:42:18	sure	are ump always some kind of "terminal objects" ?
2014-02-01 03:42:23	sure	or initial
2014-02-01 03:42:44	sure	because of uniqueness i wound say yes ?
2014-02-01 03:42:54	tac	yeah
2014-02-01 03:43:05	tac	In fact, an initial object is just a terminal object in the opposite category
2014-02-01 03:43:10	sure	yes
2014-02-01 03:43:31	tac	So they all boil down to just the one notion: "there exists a unique map" into some object
2014-02-01 03:43:37	sure	and given a terminal object, can I find a "non trivial" UMP for this object ?
2014-02-01 03:44:11	tac	That's the magic of category theory, in my opinion. You express all of these wonderful constructions: products, coproducts, equalizers, free groups, abelianizations, pullbacks, equalizers, etc...
2014-02-01 03:44:11	sure	(i know this question is ratehr fuzzy but still)
2014-02-01 03:44:22	tac	all using just ONE notion: there exists a unique arrow.
2014-02-01 03:44:39	sure	i'm just at "product" and free objects right now
2014-02-01 03:44:40	sure	ahah
2014-02-01 03:44:43	sure	but yes
2014-02-01 03:44:46	sure	its a strong characterization
2014-02-01 03:45:01	sure	thats what i was asking for, for a "purely diagrammatic characterization
2014-02-01 03:45:01	sure	"
2014-02-01 03:45:22	sure	tac: what is the notation C_1x_{C_0) C_1 ?
2014-02-01 03:45:29	sure	what does this x_C0 mean
2014-02-01 03:45:34	tac	dunno
2014-02-01 03:45:37	tac	is it in awodey?
2014-02-01 03:45:45	sure	no i found it in internal category
2014-02-01 03:45:53	sure	i though it was a standard product but it appears that its different
2014-02-01 03:45:57	tac	oh
2014-02-01 03:46:05	tac	a × with a subscript?
2014-02-01 03:46:08	sure	yes
2014-02-01 03:46:14	tac	That's a fibered product (or pullback)
2014-02-01 03:46:17	sure	ok
2014-02-01 03:46:26	sure	over C_0
2014-02-01 03:46:28	sure	i see
2014-02-01 03:46:30	tac	They are what happen when you modify the notion of a wedge just a little bit
2014-02-01 03:46:35	tac	instead of "wedges over A and B"
2014-02-01 03:46:46	tac	You add a third element C, and arrows A -> C and B -> C
2014-02-01 03:47:16	sure	btw
2014-02-01 03:47:22	tac	then a wedge (or a cone) over A -> C <- B    is an object Z together with *three* arrows, Z -> A, A -> B, and Z -> C that make everything commute
2014-02-01 03:47:35	tac	So Z -> A -> C is the same as going directly from Z -> C through the wedge arrow
2014-02-01 03:47:55	sure	i see
2014-02-01 03:47:58	sure	btw
2014-02-01 03:48:08	sure	as far as i understand rudiments of CT
2014-02-01 03:48:24	sure	it looks like one can express powerful characterization without any quantifiers
2014-02-01 03:48:43	tomprince	What do you mean without any quantifiers?
2014-02-01 03:48:48	sure	isn't it a proof that CT is much more powerful to express things than first order logic ?
2014-02-01 03:48:55	tac	The choice of category often puts enough restrictions on the thing you're interested in.
2014-02-01 03:49:00	sure	yes thats why
2014-02-01 03:49:04	sure	the restriction are so "har"
2014-02-01 03:49:05	sure	hard
2014-02-01 03:49:12	sure	that you don't need any quantifier to express a propert
2014-02-01 03:49:14	sure	that you don't need any quantifier to express a property
2014-02-01 03:49:18	sure	you just have "a diagram"
2014-02-01 03:49:19	tomprince	"There exists a unique arrow" has two quantifiers (in first-order logic)
2014-02-01 03:49:42	sure	hm true for uniqueness
2014-02-01 03:49:44	sure	how can you remove it
2014-02-01 03:49:47	tac	You don't.
2014-02-01 03:50:07	sure	do you need it ?
2014-02-01 03:50:07	sure	no
2014-02-01 03:50:10	sure	you can show uniqueness
2014-02-01 03:50:14	sure	its a consequence of the diagram
2014-02-01 03:50:15	sure	right ?
2014-02-01 03:50:23	tac	When you reason about categories, you still use you usual logic
2014-02-01 03:50:41	tac	Categories don't replace set theory outright. And they don't replace logic.
2014-02-01 03:50:49	sure	sure it won't replace logic
2014-02-01 03:50:55	sure	you need a logic but what i want to say is
2014-02-01 03:50:58	tac	You still use quantifiers in your logic
2014-02-01 03:51:04	tomprince	sure: A diagram is just some lines and labels. It doesn't mean anything without context.
2014-02-01 03:51:06	sure	i feel that you can express powerful characterization without any quantifier
2014-02-01 03:51:13	tac	When you say "for any category, suppose A and B are objects and let W be a wedge over A and B..."
2014-02-01 03:51:18	tac	You're swimming in quantifiers
2014-02-01 03:51:35	sure	because you think too much "classicaly"
2014-02-01 03:51:45	tac	One word of warning from my experience
2014-02-01 03:51:49	sure	what if my axioms of my theory is just category theory and the "operation" i'm allowed to do
2014-02-01 03:51:58	tac	Don't try to abandon classical thinking so quickly :) You waste a lot of time.
2014-02-01 03:52:21	sure	i really feel that you can express powerful ideas without any quantifier in CT
2014-02-01 03:52:24	tac	People believe that you can do category theory and avoid having to worry about "EVIL" (thinking about exact equality) and work with, say, type theory instead of sets.
2014-02-01 03:52:28	tomprince	The axioms of category theory are full of quantifiers.
2014-02-01 03:52:41	tac	But most of category theory is still written by working mathematicians, and we think about them classically.
2014-02-01 03:53:01	sure	thats true tomprince but can't you reformulate it without any ?
2014-02-01 03:53:03	tac	A category is just a funny algebraic structure. A generalization of a monoid.
2014-02-01 03:53:04	sure	considering
2014-02-01 03:53:10	sure	you can characterize what it means to be a category INSIDE CT ?
2014-02-01 03:53:24	tac	sure: If you want to work like that, you need topos theory, probably.
2014-02-01 03:53:26	tomprince	You'll still be swimming in quantifiers.
2014-02-01 03:53:34	tac	That's fine, but no one in the world (except Lawvere) does it that way.
2014-02-01 03:53:35	sure	then i guess i need topos
2014-02-01 03:53:42	tomprince	What do you have against quantifiers, anyway?
2014-02-01 03:53:43	tac	and yeah, it's still got quantifiers
2014-02-01 03:53:45	sure	can i have some references ?
2014-02-01 03:54:00	sure	tomprince: they link variables and don't make any difference between implicit and explicit object
2014-02-01 03:54:05	sure	they are pretty bad actuall
2014-02-01 03:54:05	sure	y
2014-02-01 03:54:17	tac	Try Leinster's  "Rethinking Set Theory"
2014-02-01 03:54:23	sure	k thx tac
2014-02-01 03:54:30	tac	But don't waste too much time with trying to throw away your logic
2014-02-01 03:54:34	tac	It's a fool's game.
2014-02-01 03:54:38	tomprince	sure: That's 'cause there isn't a difference.
2014-02-01 03:54:41	tac	Like trying to remove the floor from beneath your feet.
2014-02-01 03:54:51	sure	because of quantifiers firt order logic doesn't make any difference between implicit and explicit
2014-02-01 03:55:10	tac	anyway, I have to run
2014-02-01 03:55:10	sure	tac: i don't want to remove my logic, i want to rethink it
2014-02-01 03:55:22	sure	thx for references
2014-02-01 03:55:31	sure	tomprince: well i'm convinced there is
2014-02-01 03:55:40	sure	thats the difference between a theorem and a property
2014-02-01 03:56:02	sure	a theorem is something "syntaxic" in some sense, full of implicit, linked variable that doesn't denote anything in particular
2014-02-01 03:56:05	tomprince	sure: If you want to talk about what you are calling "implicit" and "explicit" you should come up with different words, since the way you are using them don't match up with the convential mathematical meanings.
2014-02-01 03:56:14	sure	hm
2014-02-01 03:56:16	sure	how could i name them
2014-02-01 03:56:20	tomprince	And then come up with some unambiguous definitions.
2014-02-01 03:56:30	sure	well i would need to define a working theory for that
2014-02-01 03:56:31	sure	ahah
2014-02-01 03:56:31	tomprince	.... or, maybe do it in the opposite order.
2014-02-01 03:56:46	sure	give me some time to think about how to do it
2014-02-01 03:56:49	sure	:>
2014-02-01 03:57:11	sure	but clearly, for all n,m n+m = (n+m)
2014-02-01 03:57:14	sure	is different than 2+3 = 5
2014-02-01 03:57:25	tomprince	Sure, one is quantified, the other isn't.
2014-02-01 03:57:28	sure	yes
2014-02-01 03:57:40	sure	and being quantified is related to something that is not yet evaluated
2014-02-01 03:57:43	sure	its implicit
2014-02-01 03:57:56	sure	it doesn't denote anything in particular
2014-02-01 03:58:05	tomprince	It seems quite explicit to me.
2014-02-01 03:58:19	sure	well think about richard paradox
2014-02-01 03:58:30	sure	do you know it ?
2014-02-01 03:58:59	sure	it tries to denote "the smallest integer that can be written with less than 50 syllabes" (say)
2014-02-01 03:59:04	sure	50 words if you wish
2014-02-01 03:59:12	sure	this is an implicit definition
2014-02-01 03:59:22	sure	that is supposed to characterize this integer, and contains less than 50 word
2014-02-01 03:59:26	sure	so it denotes nothing
2014-02-01 03:59:36	sure	because what is "implicit" in this sense is allowed to denote nothing
2014-02-01 03:59:39	sure	yet there's no contradiction
2014-02-01 03:59:45	tomprince	I looked it up. I find the resolution there perfectly satisfactory. That "can be written" isn't well defined.
2014-02-01 03:59:54	sure	yes this is true too
2014-02-01 04:00:02	sure	what about some algebra
2014-02-01 04:00:08	sure	suppose i define an algebra with a set of relations and generators
2014-02-01 04:00:15	sure	i dont KNOW at all if such algebra exist
2014-02-01 04:00:24	sure	if i can find an explicit object that satisfy those abstract relation
2014-02-01 04:00:32	sure	this definition can be true only in the empty set
2014-02-01 04:00:42	sure	and yet without any logical contradicton
2014-02-01 04:01:04	sure	thats the difference between something implicit and explicit
2014-02-01 04:02:04	tomprince	I still don't know what you are trying to get at. :
2014-02-01 04:02:07	tomprince	:/
2014-02-01 04:02:24	sure	well trying to understand teh difference between implicit and explicit
2014-02-01 04:02:51	sure	between abstract relations/definitions and objets with properties
2014-02-01 04:03:04	sure	there can be abstract relations/definition that are not satisfied by any objects
2014-02-01 04:03:06	sure	reciprocly
2014-02-01 04:03:15	sure	there can be some objects that can't be defiend by any abstract relation/definition
2014-02-01 04:03:24	sure	there's a big difference between the two
2014-02-01 04:04:12	sure	and there are many abstract characterization that denotes the same objects
2014-02-01 04:04:25	sure	a characterization could be define as an abstract definition which is only satisfied by one object
2014-02-01 04:04:36	sure	you can define such "intuitive" concets
2014-02-01 04:04:47	sure	if you succeed in making the difference between implicit and explicit

2014-02-01 04:05:48	sure	plus, there might be some "conservation of information"
2014-02-01 04:06:00	sure	for example, an equivalence would conserve come quantity
2014-02-01 04:06:03	sure	some quantity

2014-02-01 04:56:49	cads	Let F : C -> Cat be a functor. The sum category Sigma_C(F) is a category with objects (a, x) where a is an object in C and x is an object in F(a). The morphisms (f,g) : (a, x) -> (b, y) of Sigma_C(F) are morphisms with types f : a -> b and   g : F(f)(x) -> y.

2014-02-01 05:05:27	cads	I'm still not sure what it is :)
2014-02-01 05:06:05	tomprince	Well, if C is discrete, it is the disjoint union of F(c) for c in C.
2014-02-01 05:06:50	tomprince	If C isn't discrete, then it something like that, except for glue together.
2014-02-01 05:09:12	tomprince	I think the wreath product may be an example.

2014-02-01 14:14:59	rola	hm?*
2014-02-01 14:15:07	augur	rola: $ is more or less nonsense in CT
2014-02-01 14:15:27	augur	there is no application in category theory
2014-02-01 14:15:45	rola	In Lawvere's treatment of sets, an element x of a set A is a map x : 1 → A. so for every map f : A → B, you have f.x
2014-02-01 14:15:48	augur	except in special kinds of categories where you make it possible
2014-02-01 14:16:00	augur	yes, thats correct
2014-02-01 14:18:28	rola	Can you tell me a little more about why there's no application or redirect me to somewherethat explains why?
2014-02-01 14:18:50	augur	there's no application because it's just not part of the definition of a category
2014-02-01 14:19:52	augur	the closest thing is application in a CCC where you have exponential objects that are kind of like functions at least from their appearance/behavior
2014-02-01 14:20:44	augur	in |Set, exponentials just are functions, so Hom(A,B) x A -> B makes sense, since Hom(A,B) is an exponential in |Set
2014-02-01 14:20:58	augur	but in general categories its just a nonsense thing to write Hom(A,B) x A -> B
2014-02-01 14:21:24	augur	nevermind $, the type itself is meaningless
2014-02-01 14:22:29	augur	again, except in the very special case of CCCs like |Set, where you have objects that correspond to homsets
2014-02-01 14:23:30	augur	its not quite the same thing tho since its not necessarily a set
2014-02-01 14:25:51	augur	night
2014-02-01 14:25:55	rola	thanks !
2014-02-01 14:26:02	rola	good night.
2014-02-01 14:26:19	augur	rola: just think tho about where $ would have to live
2014-02-01 14:26:29	augur	A and B would be objects in |C
2014-02-01 14:26:35	augur	x would have to be a product on |C
2014-02-01 14:26:45	augur	so Hom(A,B) would have to be an object of |C?
2014-02-01 14:26:57	augur	but Hom(A,B) is a set, so its not an object in arbitrary |C
2014-02-01 14:27:26	augur	and besides, what does application mean in an arbitrary category where objects dont necessarily "contain" values?
2014-02-01 14:27:41	augur	etc
2014-02-01 14:27:44	augur	ok night

2014-02-01 20:59:48	sure	question
2014-02-01 21:00:07	sure	suppose i have a category C such that each pair of object in C admits a product
2014-02-01 21:01:34	sure	one can show that there exists a functor x : CxC -> C, where CxC is the category of pairs with usual composition, to C, such that x(A,B) = A<-AxB ->B and x( (f,g)) = fxg the unique isomorphism thx to ump
2014-02-01 21:01:46	sure	unique arrow sorry
2014-02-01 21:02:00	sure	is x an "inverticle functor" ?
2014-02-01 21:02:12	sure	b
2014-02-01 21:03:42	Saizan	can you explain what you mean by x(A,B) = A<-AxB ->B?
2014-02-01 21:03:59	sure	i take a pair (A,B) of objects in CxC, where A and B are objects of C
2014-02-01 21:04:08	sure	and i send it to a product of A and B
2014-02-01 21:04:19	sure	because of ump, all products are isomorphic, so i can chose any of them
2014-02-01 21:04:39	sure	with of course, the projection maps
2014-02-01 21:04:41	sure	p_1, p_2
2014-02-01 21:05:19	sure	if C is small, so is CxC, so is the arrow x in Cat epic, monic, or an isomorphism ?
2014-02-01 21:05:25	sure	or does it really depends on the structure of C ?
2014-02-01 21:06:05	sure	i guess it won't be an isomorphism because you can have the pair (A,B) and (B,A) that would form the same produc in C
2014-02-01 21:06:13	sure	i dunno
2014-02-01 21:08:57	sure	the composition in x(CxC) is given by (f'xg')°(fxg) = (f'°f)x(g'°g)
2014-02-01 21:09:25	sure	where again, fxg is just the unique arrow <f,g> here noted fxg
2014-02-01 21:09:59	sure	<f°p_1,g°p_2> = fxg sorry

2014-02-01 21:17:39	sure	i can't prove it
2014-02-01 21:19:42	Saizan	i'd try to work with the definitions directly
2014-02-01 21:19:58	Saizan	and the fact that 1xA~A
2014-02-01 21:20:17	sure	what is 1 ?
2014-02-01 21:20:48	Saizan	oh, maybe you're not assuming it exists, but it'd be the terminal object
2014-02-01 21:21:04	sure	does it always exists ?
2014-02-01 21:21:07	Saizan	i.e. the nullary product
2014-02-01 21:21:14	Saizan	not always
2014-02-01 21:25:46	sure	if small, i guess there's a terminal object ?
2014-02-01 21:28:13	Saizan	not necessarily, e.g. the category with 3 objects {0,1,2} and two (non identity) arrows 0 -> 1, 0 -> 2 has no terminal object

2014-02-02 04:34:14	sure	i feel that a book is much more exhaustive
2014-02-02 04:34:21	augur_	i enjoy watching someone explain something more than reading about the thing
2014-02-02 04:34:39	sure	i guess it can help yes
2014-02-02 04:34:42	sure	but at least when you read a book

2014-02-02 22:40:57	carter	NickKidman: i'd expect it to contribute to th theory of integrals over very very very abstract things that make R^n look simple and concrete
2014-02-02 22:41:01	carter	i can ask a friend though
2014-02-02 22:41:22	carter	though threre is kinda an algebraic theory of integral like operations
2014-02-02 22:41:29	NickKidman	yes
2014-02-02 22:41:54	NickKidman	I know, vaguely, hopf algebras are deeply related to combinatorics and integration is some kind of collecting
2014-02-02 22:41:55	carter	though its largely a different community that the geometrist / algebraists
2014-02-02 22:42:55	NickKidman	I also know that on the nLab, there are some freaky perspectives on integral transforms.
2014-02-02 22:44:34	NickKidman	also, Pontryagin duality and stuff is somewhat mappy
2014-02-02 22:46:11	carter	NickKidman: that said, i'd be very very suprised if categorical approach handles topics like "wellposedness" and "numerical stability" and other things that matter for actually evaluating the integrals in finite time
2014-02-02 22:46:20	carter	(though that would be cool)
2014-02-02 22:56:45	noteventime	There's also motivic integration
2014-02-02 22:58:00	noteventime	carter: I could imagine CT cropping up in symbolic integration
2014-02-02 22:58:25	carter	not really
2014-02-02 22:58:35	carter	integration isnt analytica
2014-02-02 23:00:20	noteventime	Also, there have been attempts to formalise probability theory involving CT, and arguably probability theory is a lot about doing integrals without doing integrals :P
2014-02-02 23:00:24	noteventime	carter: What do you mean?
2014-02-02 23:00:49	carter	not every integral has an analytically expressible solution
2014-02-02 23:01:18	carter	is all
2014-02-02 23:01:24	NickKidman	this isn't necessarily CT, but related to integration: is there some "reason" why the Gamma function seems to be so important? In the way that the Riemann function is important or the exponential function (I'd argue factorization in rings and exponential maps in manifolds for the latter). The Gamma function relates to both, comes up intependendly in any case - but ... is kind of not related to any "structure" in this sense, as far as I can se
2014-02-02 23:01:48	carter	thats veering into number thoery, of which i know little
2014-02-02 23:01:52	noteventime	carter: What does that have to do with whether it could be useful in symbolic integration though? (I agree that symbolic integration is somewhat limited in scope)
2014-02-02 23:02:23	carter	well, namely that its not a total map :)
2014-02-02 23:02:30	NickKidman	symbolic integration is heavy Galois theory, right? So that's smells like CT is relevant
2014-02-02 23:02:49	carter	NickKidman: really?! any good exposition on that?
2014-02-02 23:03:12	NickKidman	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm
2014-02-02 23:03:13	NickKidman	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_%28differential_algebra%29
2014-02-02 23:03:37	carter	wikipedia isn't an good exposition, but thanks!
2014-02-02 23:04:02	noteventime	NickKidman: Isn't it enough that its an extension of the factorial?
2014-02-02 23:04:14	NickKidman	yeah, well...I know of one book
2014-02-02 23:04:31	NickKidman	maybe this
2014-02-02 23:04:31	NickKidman	http://www.springer.com/mathematics/algebra/book/978-3-540-21493-9
2014-02-02 23:04:32	carter	noteventime: NickKidman  i very much like formalisms where theres a constructive solution procedure that just works ™
2014-02-02 23:04:58	carter	partly 'cause i spend too much time trying to build numerical computing toolsls
2014-02-02 23:05:01	NickKidman	yeah, that was it
2014-02-02 23:05:53	NickKidman	that would have been the proper Wiki link:
2014-02-02 23:05:53	NickKidman	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Galois_theory
2014-02-02 23:06:31	NickKidman	noteventime: not sure if that doesn't just shift the problem
2014-02-02 23:06:48	noteventime	How so?
2014-02-02 23:07:28	NickKidman	why is a non integer factorical important. Factorial, I can explain as being the cardinal of a finite group.
2014-02-02 23:07:49	NickKidman	smooth interpolations of descrete transformations are abstruse
2014-02-02 23:08:15	noteventime	Couldn't the gamma function arise as the limit of discrete ones then?
2014-02-02 23:08:34	NickKidman	limit towards what?
2014-02-02 23:08:50	noteventime	obviously not the limit of single factorials, but stuff like rational functions of factorials, or similar
2014-02-02 23:09:02	noteventime	Not sure, was just a thought
2014-02-02 23:09:36	NickKidman	My approach: the Riemann zeta function is -effectively- the Mellin transform of the prime counting function. it's the smooth object containing the spectrum information of numbers. Now I see the Gamma function is the Mellin transform of the exponential function...
2014-02-02 23:10:10	NickKidman	there is a SE thread on "groking" the gamma function, it relates to probablities
2014-02-02 23:10:29	NickKidman	http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3444/intuition-for-the-definition-of-the-gamma-function
2014-02-02 23:11:17	NickKidman	CT isn't the very best friend of categories, as I understand, so maybe there's my problem in seeing structrue

2014-02-04 17:47:29	prine	let C be a category which admits binary products: is it possible that two different kind of product exist inside this category ?
2014-02-04 17:48:21	mr-	Both would have to satisfy the universal property. That induces an isomorphism between the products. Does that answer your question?
2014-02-04 17:48:57	prine	no, i know that for two product of A and B, there is an isomorphism
2014-02-04 17:49:20	prine	but suppose i have A, B, C as objects
2014-02-04 17:49:31	prine	is it possible that AxB and BxC has a different "structure product" ?
2014-02-04 17:50:00	mr-	Sorry, I don't understand that question. What is the "structure product"?
2014-02-04 17:50:04	prine	in Sets, because one can show that the cartesian product works for all objects (A,B), there is only "one kind" of product
2014-02-04 17:50:22	prine	but one can imagine that there exists different "kind" of product in any arbitrary category right ?
2014-02-04 17:50:39	mr-	That's not true, though. You can define A x B = {(b,a)}, if you like.
2014-02-04 17:51:03	prine	but it will be isomorphic to the other one
2014-02-04 17:51:07	prine	by UMP
2014-02-04 17:51:20	Saizan	if you formalize Set through e.g. ZF you can have different representations of products
2014-02-04 17:51:23	mr-	Indeed, like in any category. I am still trying to figure out what the question is :-)
2014-02-04 17:51:34	prine	hm, let me try to formulate it with a false example
2014-02-04 17:51:45	prine	suppose i have a category with 3 objects, A, B, C
2014-02-04 17:52:17	prine	is it possible that the product of AxB is the union of sets for example, and the product of AxC is disjoint union ? (ok i know this is co product)
2014-02-04 17:52:34	prine	those are "two different kind" of products
2014-02-04 17:52:37	prine	inside the same category
2014-02-04 17:53:16	prine	UMP only tells me product is the same for the two same objects
2014-02-04 17:53:27	prine	it doesnt tell me that the "structure" of product is the same (modulo isomorphism) for the others ones, right ?
2014-02-04 17:53:42	mr-	ake Set x Set^op,
2014-02-04 17:53:45	Saizan	there's some uniformity that products of different objects need to satisfy, e.g. you can prove that x is associative
2014-02-04 17:54:20	Saizan	but how varied they can be depends on the category
2014-02-04 17:54:29	prine	well it can be associative and has "different kind" of product too
2014-02-04 17:54:56	Saizan	that's what i'm saying :)
2014-02-04 17:55:10	prine	so the answer of my question is yes ?
2014-02-04 17:55:16	Saizan	in a sense the category must hide those differences though, afaiu

2014-02-04 17:56:34	mr-	I think you could cook up examples in Set x Set^op, with B = ({},B_2) and C = (C_1, {*}) _or something_
2014-02-04 17:56:44	prine	i could try mr-, thx
2014-02-04 17:56:51	mr-	examples in the sense that the products "look" different.
2014-02-04 17:57:22	prine	i need 3 objets for my example
2014-02-04 17:57:28	prine	because of course with 2 objects it will be isomorphic
2014-02-04 17:57:35	mr-	Yes. And A = (A_1, A_2) ;-)
2014-02-04 17:57:45	prine	ok ahah
2014-02-04 17:57:58	prine	then what does it mean on the category, if i can find a "universal construction" of product
2014-02-04 17:58:04	prine	like cartesian product or disjoint union for coproduct
2014-02-04 17:58:16	prine	that the category is "regular" in some sense ?
2014-02-04 17:58:26	prine	is there a criterion to know that ?
2014-02-04 17:59:00	mr-	I don't know a good definition of "universal construction" in your sense.
2014-02-04 17:59:08	prine	(i mean, an explicit definition of what AxB is for all (A,B) in category)
2014-02-04 17:59:22	prine	simply a definition that works for all objects that admits a product
2014-02-04 17:59:29	prine	if (A,B) satisfy a product, then AxB is of the form ...
2014-02-04 17:59:36	prine	(modulo isomorphism, always)
2014-02-04 17:59:48	Saizan	tbf trying to determine the concrete definitions of things in a category is kind of missing the point, though it can be useful
2014-02-04 18:00:27	prine	well, thats why i'm looking for a "criterion" that tells me : This category admits only "one kind" of product (modulo isomorphism), or this one admits more
2014-02-04 18:00:40	prine	but i have no intuition how to show that
2014-02-04 18:02:33	Saizan	i guess you need to try to find a formal definition for "admists only one vs. admits more"
2014-02-04 18:03:11	prine	in a category that admits binary product, it is easy: all products are isomorphic
2014-02-04 18:03:11	prine	i guess its possible to make some kind of "ump"
2014-02-04 18:03:11	prine	this tells "there is only one kind of product"
2014-02-04 18:03:11	prine	hm no
2014-02-04 18:03:12	prine	i don't know how to formulate it
2014-02-04 18:03:12	prine	in a good way
2014-02-04 18:03:13	prine	ahah
2014-02-04 18:03:16	prine	yes
2014-02-04 18:03:41	prine	but i need to know quotient category first i guess
2014-02-04 18:03:49	prine	to take into account "modulo isomorphism"

2014-02-04 18:09:09	Saizan	ah, yeah, Hom(c,lim D_i) ~= lim Hom(c,D_i) is one of those definitions through representability (if you assume naturality in c, i think)
2014-02-04 18:09:23	notdan	that that statement is equivalent to the very definition of a limit
2014-02-04 18:12:20	Saizan	the idea is that if you take c = lim D_i and pass id_(lim D_i) to the isomorphism you get out a limit in set: "lim Hom(lim D_i,D_i)"
2014-02-04 18:12:37	Saizan	and from that you can unpack the projections etc.
2014-02-04 18:13:49	notdan	pass id to which isomorphism?
2014-02-04 18:14:09	Saizan	 Hom(lim D_i,lim D_i) ~= lim Hom(lim D_i,D_i)
2014-02-04 18:14:54	notdan	well I am ttrying to establish that isomorphism
2014-02-04 18:15:10	Saizan	ah, i guess i went the other way
2014-02-04 18:17:57	prine	i have a question about equalizers
2014-02-04 18:18:06	Saizan	i guess the point is that lim Hom(c,D_i) = Nat(Const c,D), which is a cone iiuc
2014-02-04 18:18:27	prine	does one have to understand the object E as the "biggest" object for which the equality of the two morphism f°e = g°e holds ?

2014-02-04 18:20:59	Saizan	yeah, every other object with that property can be mapped to it
2014-02-04 18:21:54	notdan	buy lim Hom(c, D_i) is Hom(c, lim D-i)?
2014-02-04 18:21:57	notdan	sorry I still don't get it
2014-02-04 18:22:28	notdan	where does the const functor come up in all this
2014-02-04 18:23:06	Saizan	mh, maybe i skipped a step there
2014-02-04 18:23:36	Saizan	but i think you want to take lim Hom(c,D_i) and expand the definition of limit in Set
2014-02-04 18:24:00	Saizan	then check it with the definition of limit for D_i
2014-02-04 18:24:09	Saizan	s/check/compare/
2014-02-04 18:24:39	notdan	So, for example, in case of products. Hom (A, X x Y) should be the limit for a diagram X, Y. That mena sthat for every set S which has arrows (f: S -> Hom(A,X)) and (g:S->Hom(A,Y)) there must exists a unique arrow S->Hom(A,XxY)
2014-02-04 18:25:09	notdan	what do you mean by a definition of limit in Set, it's stll the same definition, no?
2014-02-04 18:25:37	Saizan	i guess i should have said "construction"
2014-02-04 18:25:56	notdan	Ok, I'll think about \it, thanks
2014-02-04 18:26:07	notdan	I know the constructions for the specific limits, but not in general

2014-02-04 18:34:35	prine	if i understand well universal construction, it always mean that the object constructed is the "biggest" or the "smallest" right ?
2014-02-04 18:48:09	notdan	prine: I guess so. It is biggest especially if we are talking about categories of orders

2014-02-04 19:57:03	notdan	mr-: basically yes
2014-02-04 19:58:19	mr-	notdan: maybe it is helpful to think about that in the case of a pullback (the easiest non trivial limit, I think)
2014-02-04 19:59:27	mr-	notdan: suppose you take the pullback (call it P) of A -> B and C -> B. What is a map X -> P ?
2014-02-04 20:01:06	mr-	notdan: it is a map X -> A and a map X -> C such that the composites to B are equal. But that data is exactly an element in the pullback of Hom(X,A) -> Hom(X,B) and Hom(X,C) -> Hom(X,B).
2014-02-04 20:03:13	mr-	Does that make sense to you?

2014-02-04 20:33:40	notdan	oh yeah it does make sense
2014-02-04 20:33:43	notdan	thanks
2014-02-04 20:45:48	prine	is a pullpack simply a generalization of an equalizer ?
2014-02-04 20:47:22	prine	to me it looks like a generalization of the equalizer for which the two arrows with different domain
2014-02-04 20:47:25	mr-	prine: yes
2014-02-04 20:47:37	prine	ok thx
2014-02-04 20:47:56	prine	so one could also define a pullback for n arrows
2014-02-04 20:48:08	mr-	And they are all just special instances of limits
2014-02-04 20:48:09	mr-	Sure
2014-02-04 20:48:24	prine	ok, so i guess i should really see what is a limit
2014-02-04 20:48:24	prine	:>
2014-02-04 20:49:54	mr-	It is quite general: limits are things that have a universal property for mapping into them.
2014-02-04 20:50:04	notdan	it's a generalization of an equalizer and a product
2014-02-04 20:50:12	notdan	in fact, if you have equalizers and products you have pullbacks
2014-02-04 20:50:29	prine	oh yes, i see where you see the product
2014-02-04 20:50:32	prine	yes ok
2014-02-04 20:50:33	prine	its "both"
2014-02-04 20:50:35	prine	you're right
2014-02-04 20:51:05	prine	so the pullback over A and B identifies as a product of A and B
2014-02-04 20:51:25	mr-	That observation is actually really useful. When you consider a limit in some category, it does not hurt to think about an "element" of the limit to be a sequence of objects
2014-02-04 20:51:29	prine	and it is also an equalizer
2014-02-04 20:52:00	prine	what is the definition of a limit mr- ?
2014-02-04 20:52:03	prine	so i can see what you mean
2014-02-04 20:52:10	mr-	i.e. in sets: lim A_i is a subset of prod_i A_i
2014-02-04 20:55:32	notdan	mr-: hm I dont see it :(
2014-02-04 20:55:37	notdan	how is it true for every limit
2014-02-04 20:56:56	notdan	prine: imagine you have a diagram. A limit for this diagram is an object O wogether with arrows to all the other objects s.t. the whole thing commutes
2014-02-04 20:57:03	Saizan	well, from every limit you can project out the A_i's
2014-02-04 20:57:30	prine	ok
2014-02-04 20:57:33	prine	so its a generalized pullback
2014-02-04 20:57:40	prine	its a pullback for every object of the diagram
2014-02-04 20:57:45	notdan	it's a generalized everything :)
2014-02-04 20:57:51	notdan	hm
2014-02-04 20:57:54	prine	which is also a generalized product
2014-02-04 20:58:00	notdan	well i wouldnt say that
2014-02-04 20:58:05	notdan	it's not a pullback for every object
2014-02-04 20:58:08	Saizan	if you can build every limit out of products and pullbacks, iirc?
2014-02-04 20:58:13	Saizan	s/if//

2014-02-04 21:00:12	prine	a diagram is a functor : where does it sends the object that are not inside the diagrams ?
2014-02-04 21:00:36	notdan	A pullback is a limit of the following diagram: https://files.app.net/f6nlaCSR.png
2014-02-04 21:00:46	notdan	eg an object with arrows, s.t. everything commutes
2014-02-04 21:00:51	notdan	+ it's the biggest object
2014-02-04 21:01:01	prine	yes i understood qualitatively what is a limit with your definition
2014-02-04 21:01:46	prine	but i don't understand how a functor is a diagram
2014-02-04 21:01:53	prine	where does it sends the objects that are not inside your diagram ?
2014-02-04 21:02:30	prine	can you send them to "0" ?
2014-02-04 21:02:33	prine	i don't understand
2014-02-04 21:03:21	Saizan	a diagram in the category C is a functor D : I -> C from some "shape" category I
2014-02-04 21:03:27	Saizan	which is usually very simple
2014-02-04 21:03:48	prine	oh ok i got it
2014-02-04 21:04:04	prine	your shape category has no more object that the ones involved in the diagram
2014-02-04 21:04:08	prine	and no more arrows
2014-02-04 21:04:10	prine	thats it ?
2014-02-04 21:04:19	notdan	yea
2014-02-04 21:04:34	prine	so D is like a "representation" of I in C
2014-02-04 21:04:43	prine	you're representing the "abstract" diagram in C

2014-02-04 21:07:03	prine	i think thats how you have to do
2014-02-04 21:07:16	prine	to explain what it means to be a different kind of product
2014-02-04 21:07:52	prine	you have your product diagram from I to C
2014-02-04 21:07:56	prine	and you have two functor
2014-02-04 21:07:57	prine	F and G
2014-02-04 21:08:02	prine	and two different type of product
2014-02-04 21:08:06	prine	should be non isomorphic functors ?
2014-02-04 21:08:29	prine	yes this looks to be good
2014-02-04 21:09:04	prine	so you have inequivalente representation of a product
2014-02-04 21:09:04	prine	thats it
2014-02-04 21:09:10	prine	as inequivalent represnetation in group theory
2014-02-04 21:09:20	prine	the functor is interpreted as a representation of your diagram
2014-02-04 21:09:35	prine	mr-: does this look good for what it means to be a "kind" of product ?
2014-02-04 21:10:19	prine	i guess you need the concept of natural transfomration that i don't know
2014-02-04 21:10:26	prine	to explain whqat it means to be isomorphic functor
2014-02-04 21:10:29	prine	but thats the idea
2014-02-04 21:10:40	prine	and so it is sufficient to "count" the unmber of inequivalent class of isomorphic functor
2014-02-04 21:10:48	prine	and you have the number of "kind of product" you have in your category
2014-02-04 21:11:43	prine	i should look what is a natural transformation first
2014-02-04 21:11:44	prine	but i'm sure it works
2014-02-04 21:13:54	prine	of course in Set, you would find that every functor from your product diagram I to Set is the same
2014-02-04 21:14:05	prine	because all products are of the same kind
2014-02-04 21:15:26	prine	do you think it works Saizan ?
2014-02-04 21:18:00	Saizan	i'm not sure which functors you are trying to compare
2014-02-04 21:18:19	prine	two different functor F, G, from I to C
2014-02-04 21:18:23	prine	where C is a category that admits some products
2014-02-04 21:18:31	prine	and I is just the "product category"

2014-02-04 21:20:55	prine	I see
2014-02-04 21:21:01	Saizan	and the diagram would be a functor which sends one object to A adn the other to B
2014-02-04 21:21:04	prine	and then you take the limit

2014-02-04 21:22:24	prine	because of the ump
2014-02-04 21:22:39	prine	you need to use the limit in the category you map your diagram

2014-02-04 21:23:41	prine	with functor maybe ?
2014-02-04 21:24:27	Saizan	well, if C has all the binary products you can have a functor which sends pair of objects to their product

2014-02-04 21:31:35	prine	how comes ?
2014-02-04 21:32:18	Saizan	because the definition gives you everything you need to know to manipulate the product categorically, i.e. with morphisms from the category

2014-02-04 21:35:02	prine	if C has all binary products
2014-02-04 21:35:31	prine	then there might be a functor [] that send CxC to C
2014-02-04 21:35:54	prine	and forms "sometimes" [](A,B) = AxB and "sometimes" [](A,C) = A.C
2014-02-04 21:36:07	prine	so yes
2014-02-04 21:36:11	prine	maybe one has to look this functor
2014-02-04 21:36:14	prine	to characterize what i want
2014-02-04 21:36:20	Saizan	you could just ask, "are AxB and A.B isomorphic?"
2014-02-04 21:36:36	prine	well, AxB and A.B yes
2014-02-04 21:36:37	prine	its obvious
2014-02-04 21:36:39	prine	because of UMP
2014-02-04 21:36:45	Saizan	sorry, x and .
2014-02-04 21:36:46	prine	or you mean as functors ?
2014-02-04 21:36:48	Saizan	as functors
2014-02-04 21:37:01	Saizan	but they will be isomorphic
2014-02-04 21:37:10	Saizan	for the same reason
2014-02-04 21:37:20	Saizan	so you might want to ask if they are _equal_
2014-02-04 21:37:31	prine	no i don't care about equality
2014-02-04 21:37:41	prine	what you're telling me is
2014-02-04 21:37:49	prine	if i find some construction that is a product in a category
2014-02-04 21:37:58	prine	then this construction will work for every objects (A,B) in this category
2014-02-04 21:38:01	prine	that admits a product
2014-02-04 21:38:05	prine	this looks weird
2014-02-04 21:38:08	prine	too powerful
2014-02-04 21:38:29	prine	it means there is only "ond kind" of product per category
2014-02-04 21:38:33	prine	how comes ?
2014-02-04 21:38:42	Saizan	i'm just saying that if you can construct every product, every other way to construct every product will be isomorphic
2014-02-04 21:39:03	prine	my question is about the construction process of the product
2014-02-04 21:39:16	prine	again, i agree that A.B and AxB is isomorphic because are the same objects
2014-02-04 21:39:24	prine	thats just UMP
2014-02-04 21:39:36	prine	but for different objects, there's nothing obvious about that
2014-02-04 21:39:39	prine	the only condition is that it is associative
2014-02-04 21:39:45	Saizan	that's why it seems to me you care about equality, or maybe some other notion in-between
2014-02-04 21:40:07	prine	no, i'm looking for "equivalent class of products"
2014-02-04 21:40:09	prine	in a same category
2014-02-04 21:40:13	Saizan	anyhow
2014-02-04 21:40:25	Saizan	you should figure this out yourself at this point :)
2014-02-04 21:40:31	prine	ahah yes
2014-02-04 21:40:36	prine	but i don't know enough concept yet
2014-02-04 21:40:42	prine	like limits, natural transformation
2014-02-04 21:40:59	Saizan	(myself i don't think it's something meaningful)
2014-02-04 21:41:14	prine	(why does people always tell me my questions are meaningless :<)
2014-02-04 21:41:15	notdan	prine: I think so
2014-02-04 21:41:21	notdan	i didnt actually read his book :(
2014-02-04 21:41:40	prine	its quite good for non mathematicians like me notdan
2014-02-04 21:41:59	notdan	People keep telling me that, but I just don't get this book!
2014-02-04 21:42:05	notdan	And I am not a mathematician
2014-02-04 21:42:33	prine	well, i have to admit at first
2014-02-04 21:42:42	prine	i was "scared" that it was too easy and too much "vulgarization"
2014-02-04 21:42:47	prine	but actually i find it quite rigorous and good
2014-02-04 21:44:34	mr-	notdan: it is true for every limit, because a map from something to the limit is a map from that something to every object such that everything commutes. A map to every object such that everything commutes is an element in the limit of the hom sets.

2014-02-04 22:51:32	notdan	Hm I understand that this provides us with the existance and associativity stuff for the limits
2014-02-04 22:51:38	notdan	but what about the uniquness
2014-02-04 22:51:47	notdan	which is also a part of the universal object property
2014-02-04 22:54:40	Saizan	i think you want to use the yoneda lemma for that

2014-02-05 01:22:53	tac	Contractibility is the new uniqueness.
2014-02-05 01:27:00	augur	:)
2014-02-05 01:27:22	augur	tac: what i mean tho is that both beta and eta emerge from the iso in identical (well, dual) ways
2014-02-05 01:27:48	augur	so i dont know why eta/uniqueness is completely unlike beta where equality is concerned
2014-02-05 01:28:06	tac	not sure what you mean
2014-02-05 01:29:26	augur	tac: bob harper says that beta rules are somehow more about definitional equality than eta rules are
2014-02-05 01:29:50	augur	and that this is related to a kind of principle of extensionality -- eta equivalence is an extensional fact
2014-02-05 01:29:51	tac	hm

2014-02-05 01:30:04	tac	I can maybe believe the smell of that
2014-02-05 01:30:13	augur	and yet beta and eta come from dual aspects of the isomorphism in CT
2014-02-05 01:30:27	tac	From what little I understand, there's an asymmetry between beta and eta that would cause the issue
2014-02-05 01:30:29	augur	"dual" in a loose sense
2014-02-05 01:30:39	augur	you get them from the different directions of the iso
2014-02-05 01:30:39	tac	And that is that eta makes terms bigger, where beta only makes them smaller
2014-02-05 01:31:01	augur	for some metric of smallness, sure
2014-02-05 01:31:01	tac	It's a matter of computability, I suppose
2014-02-05 01:31:17	tac	beta always puts you closer to normal form
2014-02-05 01:31:19	augur	computability how? eta is computable. its nearly trivial, in fact
2014-02-05 01:31:24	tac	That is definitely not true of eta
2014-02-05 01:31:59	tac	it is computable, but it isn't product with respect to type checking.
2014-02-05 01:32:04	augur	well of course not, beta is normalization, eta is eta-long-ification
2014-02-05 01:32:05	tac	productive*
2014-02-05 01:32:12	tac	right
2014-02-05 01:32:16	augur	productive in what sense
2014-02-05 01:32:29	tac	beta is critical to typechecking. Eta isn't.
2014-02-05 01:32:39	tac	They are "dual" but they are not equally important.
2014-02-05 01:32:53	augur	no thats not strictly true
2014-02-05 01:33:02	augur	in STLC, you dont need either
2014-02-05 01:33:07	augur	they're irrelevant for type checking
2014-02-05 01:33:28	augur	for DTLC you need both (often, anyway)
2014-02-05 01:34:57	augur	agda, at least, makes use of eta contraction in a bunch of places
2014-02-05 01:35:14	augur	(eta contraction, of course, does make proofs smaller)

2014-02-05 02:15:27	tac	thanks
2014-02-05 02:15:31	augur	it might be able to beta reduce, but not at the outermost level, only internally
2014-02-05 02:15:57	augur	i think?
2014-02-05 02:16:02	augur	or maybe its the other way around
2014-02-05 02:16:07	augur	who knows!
2014-02-05 02:18:05	augur	yeah, i think neutral = WHNF
2014-02-05 02:18:13	augur	or maybe it might mean fully normalized

2014-02-05 04:30:51	Cale	Hah! I didn't know that the fact that the coproduct and product of Abelian groups are isomorphic was first noticed by MacLane, but it makes sense in retrospect.
2014-02-05 04:31:39	Cale	Despite its importance, the coproduct of groups is not something that's easy to think to define without category theory.
2014-02-05 04:32:20	tac	That's the free product, right?
2014-02-05 04:32:24	Cale	yeah
2014-02-05 04:35:28	ystael	Cale: wasn't it discovered via van Kampen's theorem?
2014-02-05 04:35:43	Cale	ystael: Quite possibly!
2014-02-05 04:37:30	Cale	If that were the case, then I would suspect the amalgamated free product (i.e. the pushout) to have been defined just before the free product :)
2014-02-05 04:38:19	ystael	The first book I ever saw a definition of the free product of groups in actually called it the 'amalgamation'
2014-02-05 04:38:39	ystael	I don't remember what book it was, other than it was some first course in algebraic topology
2014-02-05 04:41:18	Cale	Usually the word amalgamated is used to indicate that G+H has been quotiented to turn it into the pushout of some maps F -> G and F -> H
2014-02-05 04:42:58	Cale	and that shows up directly in van Kampen's theorem, where F is then the fundamental group(oid) of the intersection of the parts you're decomposing the space into

2014-02-05 05:07:07	Cale	So a category consists of the following data (any manner in which we provide this data while following the laws I'll specify will define a category)
2014-02-05 05:07:40	Cale	Actually, I should say "a category C", let's give it a name :)
2014-02-05 05:08:17	Cale	So first: a collection Ob(C) of "objects" -- this can literally be any collection we choose
2014-02-05 05:08:24	klrr_	so C is (kind of) a category in the sense that its used in english?

2014-02-05 05:09:34	Cale	and then for each two objects X and Y in Ob(C), we have a collection of "arrows" written C(X,Y) or Hom_C(X,Y) or Hom(X,Y) depending on who you're talking to
2014-02-05 05:09:41	Cale	When f is in C(X,Y) we write f: X -> Y
2014-02-05 05:09:55	klrr_	what is f here?
2014-02-05 05:10:02	Cale	anything at all
2014-02-05 05:10:09	klrr_	okey
2014-02-05 05:10:11	Cale	C(X,Y) is just a collection of things
2014-02-05 05:10:22	Cale	we get to specify what those things are when we define a category
2014-02-05 05:10:44	klrr_	okey
2014-02-05 05:10:46	Cale	(A lot of the time, they might be functions, but they also might not actually be functions)
2014-02-05 05:12:16	Cale	For each three objects, X, Y, Z in Ob(C) we define a composition: given f in C(Y,Z) and g in C(X,Y), that is, given f: Y -> Z and g: X -> Y, we define:
2014-02-05 05:12:26	Cale	f . g: X -> Z
2014-02-05 05:13:15	Cale	i.e. for each pair of arrows f and g which line up, we need to say somehow which arrow in C(X,Z) is their composite

2014-02-05 05:14:19	Cale	Also, for each object X, we specify an arrow id_X: X -> X
2014-02-05 05:14:44	Cale	(this also ensures that C(X,X) cannot be an empty collection)
2014-02-05 05:14:58	Cale	Then we have some laws:
2014-02-05 05:15:22	Cale	If f: X -> Y is any arrow, then f . id_X = f and id_Y . f = f
2014-02-05 05:15:43	klrr_	so, C(X,Y) is equaliant to X -> Y in haskell?
2014-02-05 05:16:03	Cale	C(X,Y) is the collection of arrows X -> Y
2014-02-05 05:16:10	klrr_	okey
2014-02-05 05:16:21	dwcook	In the category Hask, Haskell functions are indeed the arrows
2014-02-05 05:16:24	roboguy_	arrows aren't necessarily functions
2014-02-05 05:16:47	tac	dwcook: except that can't support parametric polymorphism or typeclasses
2014-02-05 05:16:51	Cale	So lastly, before we go on, the final condition is that if f: Z -> W, g: Y -> Z, and h: X -> Y are any arrows
2014-02-05 05:17:06	Cale	then f . (g . h) = (f . g) . h
2014-02-05 05:17:07	dwcook	tac, how so?
2014-02-05 05:18:00	tac	dwcook: Where do you put something of type forall a. a -> a ?
2014-02-05 05:18:10	Cale	guys pls...
2014-02-05 05:18:12	klrr_	gonna try a thing
2014-02-05 05:18:45	Cale	klrr_: If you know what a monoid is, then the identity and associativity should seem familiar. A category is like a monoid where not all of the elements can be multiplied with each other in that respect.
2014-02-05 05:19:12	Cale	(only the arrows which line up head to tail can be composed)
2014-02-05 05:19:24	roboguy_	tac: would that be some kind of natural transformation?
2014-02-05 05:19:38	Cale	roboguy_: yes
2014-02-05 05:19:48	dwcook	tac, I see your point. Couldn't you say every object has its own though?
2014-02-05 05:20:08	Cale	Yeah, I don't think this discussion is going to help klrr_ here :)
2014-02-05 05:20:13	dwcook	Sorry, I'll be quiet
2014-02-05 05:20:15	klrr_	hmm okey i think im kind of get it
2014-02-05 05:20:30	ReinH	klrr_: there are categories where the arrows are very unlike functions, so don't get too caught up on the similarity between an arrow C(X,Y) and a function f : X -> Y
2014-02-05 05:20:44	tac	The standard way of doing it is to work with fibered categories. Natural transformations are a cute analogy, but they're just that. An analogy.
2014-02-05 05:20:47	Cale	an arrow *in* C(X,Y)
2014-02-05 05:20:50	Cale	but yeah
2014-02-05 05:20:57	ReinH	Cale: yep woops
2014-02-05 05:21:53	Cale	tac: They're a *little* more than an analogy, but yeah, you can't do all polymorphic functions like that

2014-02-05 05:23:36	ystael	oh, awesome, thank you!
2014-02-05 05:24:08	Cale	klrr_: Okay, so yeah, we can define a category where the objects are (monomorphic) Haskell types, and where the arrows are the Haskell-definable functions between those types.
2014-02-05 05:25:03	Cale	klrr_: and then the identity arrow on each type is given by id (specialised to each type)
2014-02-05 05:25:16	ReinH	and then we pretend _|_ doesn't exist...
2014-02-05 05:25:26	Cale	klrr_: and the composition of arrows f: Y -> Z and g: X -> Y is given by f . g

2014-02-05 05:26:30	klrr_	okey, is *any* function for a particular type in the category C an arrow of category C?
2014-02-05 05:26:49	Cale	klrr_: Well, you might not have things which you call functions
2014-02-05 05:27:18	Cale	klrr_: Note that in my description of what a category is, I specified that certain things are called objects and certain things are called arrows
2014-02-05 05:28:10	Cale	*Often* if you have some kind of structures, and then structure-preserving functions between them, you can get a category whose objects are those structures, and whose arrows are the structure-preserving functions
2014-02-05 05:28:22	klrr_	are X and Y the objects, or is (X,Y) a collection of object X and Y?
2014-02-05 05:28:40	Cale	X and Y have been objects everywhere that I used those letters
2014-02-05 05:29:03	Cale	i.e. arbitrary elements of the collection Ob(C)
2014-02-05 05:29:18	klrr_	structure-preserving function is some kind of fmap?
2014-02-05 05:29:34	Cale	Well, let's look at an example
2014-02-05 05:29:38	imprimable	how one can find or have the intuition that the coproduct of Monoids A+B is given by a free monoid on |A| + |B| ? i don't understand how its possible to find that alone
2014-02-05 05:30:05	Cale	imprimable: It's not directly given by that free monoid
2014-02-05 05:30:18	imprimable	yes + quotient by relation
2014-02-05 05:30:18	imprimable	sorry
2014-02-05 05:30:43	imprimable	but how can one "find" that alone ?
2014-02-05 05:30:43	Cale	imprimable: The intuition is that the coproduct is as close to a "disjoint union" of monoids as you can get while still being a monoid.
2014-02-05 05:31:09	klrr_	Cale: i must thank you very much for explaination, i gotta get to bed got a test early this morning
2014-02-05 05:31:10	klrr_	s/this/tomorrow

2014-02-05 05:31:31	klrr_	cool, thanks :) nn
2014-02-05 05:31:37	Cale	g'night!
2014-02-05 05:31:38	<--	klrr_ (~klrr@88.129.144.93) が終了 (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-02-05 05:31:51	imprimable	and why would a disjoint union looks like a free monoid quotiented by the relations
2014-02-05 05:31:53	imprimable	i don't understand
2014-02-05 05:32:22	imprimable	because you want to keep all generators from A and B, ok bu this looks "too" powerful
2014-02-05 05:32:27	Cale	imprimable: So, you know that the coproduct of A and B will have "inclusions" A -> A + B and B -> A + B
2014-02-05 05:32:59	Cale	So, you might start with just the disjoint union of A and B
2014-02-05 05:33:20	Cale	and you know already how to multiply elements of A with elements of A, or elements of B with elements of B
2014-02-05 05:33:32	imprimable	yes
2014-02-05 05:33:38	Cale	but what about elements of A with elements of B, and vice versa?
2014-02-05 05:33:49	imprimable	you don't know a priori yes
2014-02-05 05:33:56	imprimable	still you have to have a monoid
2014-02-05 05:34:34	imprimable	why don't you just suppose they don't talk to each other ?
2014-02-05 05:34:43	Cale	So, yeah, we start throwing in new elements for every such combination
2014-02-05 05:34:49	Cale	Ah, okay
2014-02-05 05:34:59	Cale	So we're trying to get something universal here
2014-02-05 05:36:43	Cale	I mean, at the end of the day, it works because it works, but the intuition should be that we shouldn't do anything which depends too much on the particular structure of A and B
2014-02-05 05:37:23	Cale	For any other monoid X and maps A -> X and B -> X, we want to be able to get a homomorphism A + B -> X
2014-02-05 05:37:26	imprimable	is it always possible to construct a "universal construction" of coproduct and product in a given category ?
2014-02-05 05:37:43	Cale	no
2014-02-05 05:38:07	Cale	Many particular categories have all products or all coproducts, but not all of them do.
2014-02-05 05:38:10	imprimable	the category needs to have binary podducts yes
2014-02-05 05:38:15	imprimable	ok
2014-02-05 05:38:59	imprimable	is there some category such that C = C^op ?
2014-02-05 05:39:10	imprimable	i mean, not trivial ons
2014-02-05 05:40:06	Cale	So a bit of intuition that I'm not entirely sure how to make formal is that A + B needs to keep a * b separate from anything in the image of A or B because if we do too much identification early on, then when we go to construct this homomorphism out of A + B, things will have been stuck together in a way that we don't want.
2014-02-05 05:40:35	Cale	imprimable: I don't know of too many interesting ones.
2014-02-05 05:40:44	imprimable	"hopf" category ?
2014-02-05 05:40:51	Cale	imprimable: There's the indiscrete category on a set of objects.
2014-02-05 05:40:52	imprimable	such that products and coproduct are self dual ?
2014-02-05 05:41:20	Cale	Oh, products and coproducts being the same thing can happen even when C is not equivalent to C^op
2014-02-05 05:41:29	imprimable	ah, ok :>
2014-02-05 05:41:33	Cale	and indeed, it happens for the category of Abelian groups
2014-02-05 05:41:34	Saizan	don't groupoids kind of fit C = C^op?
2014-02-05 05:41:56	Cale	Saizan: yeah, they ought to :)
2014-02-05 05:42:04	Cale	So, I guess I lied
2014-02-05 05:42:07	Cale	lol
2014-02-05 05:42:09	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-05 05:43:24	Cale	imprimable: So yeah, if all your arrows are invertible, you get a natural equivalence of C and C^op.
2014-02-05 05:44:08	imprimable	so you have a self dual category
2014-02-05 05:44:08	imprimable	yes
2014-02-05 05:44:49	Cale	But then you have the funny thing that (co)products only exist between objects which are isomorphic.
2014-02-05 05:45:08	tomprince	Another example of a category where C = C^{op} is he category of relations.
2014-02-05 05:45:25	tomprince	Since the arrows there don't really have a prefered direction.
2014-02-05 05:45:34	imprimable	ah true
2014-02-05 05:45:37	imprimable	they are just subsets
2014-02-05 05:45:54	imprimable	whihc is logical
2014-02-05 05:45:56	imprimable	because of symmetry
2014-02-05 05:46:03	imprimable	it codes the symmetry of teh relation
2014-02-05 05:46:06	imprimable	right, i see
2014-02-05 05:46:20	Cale	e.g. if you're working with a groupoid and you have A and B and their coproduct exists, then you have "inclusions" A -> A + B <- B, but then those are all invertible arrows, and you can invert one of them to get a chain of isomorphisms A -> A+B -> B
2014-02-05 05:47:06	imprimable	a groupoid is a category in which every object is a group ?
2014-02-05 05:47:14	imprimable	ie all morphisms are invertibl
2014-02-05 05:47:14	imprimable	e
2014-02-05 05:47:19	Cale	A groupoid is a category in which every arrow has an inverse.
2014-02-05 05:47:26	imprimable	yes i see
2014-02-05 05:47:31	tac	imprimable: other way around. Every group is a groupoid with one object.
2014-02-05 05:47:34	imprimable	so a monoidoid is just a category
2014-02-05 05:47:38	Cale	haha, yes
2014-02-05 05:47:43	tac	imprimable: exactly :)
2014-02-05 05:47:46	imprimable	strange that it is called monoid ahah
2014-02-05 05:48:05	ystael	{ mon(oid)^n | n in N }
2014-02-05 05:49:50	imprimable	what is the algebraic idea behind a monoid
2014-02-05 05:49:52	imprimable	erm
2014-02-05 05:49:54	imprimable	a groupoid
2014-02-05 05:49:57	imprimable	in terms of "symmetry"
2014-02-05 05:50:02	imprimable	if you make it "acts" for example on a set
2014-02-05 05:50:29	Cale	imprimable: Do you know any topology?
2014-02-05 05:50:35	imprimable	yes i do
2014-02-05 05:51:29	Cale	Okay, so recall that for any space X, and points a and b in X, we have a space of paths from a to b, given by continuous functions p: [0,1] -> X such that p(0) = a and p(1) = b
2014-02-05 05:52:10	Cale	and we can define two paths p and q from a to b to be equivalent when there's a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> X such that
2014-02-05 05:52:26	Cale	H(0,x) = p(x) for all x
2014-02-05 05:52:36	Cale	H(1,x) = q(x) for all x
2014-02-05 05:52:46	Cale	H(t,0) = a for all t
2014-02-05 05:52:48	imprimable	yes
2014-02-05 05:52:52	Cale	H(t,1) = b for all t
2014-02-05 05:53:30	Cale	Given a space X, we can define a groupoid whose objects are the points in X, and whose arrows are the equivalence classes of paths between those points.
2014-02-05 05:54:07	imprimable	AH
2014-02-05 05:54:08	imprimable	ok
2014-02-05 05:54:11	imprimable	i see :>
2014-02-05 05:54:26	Cale	The identity arrows a -> a are given by the equivalence class containing the constant path, and composition of arrows is defined by concatenating paths.
2014-02-05 05:54:34	imprimable	yes
2014-02-05 05:54:41	imprimable	and you only have one map from x to y
2014-02-05 05:54:49	Cale	Not necessarily
2014-02-05 05:54:53	imprimable	ah yes
2014-02-05 05:54:55	Cale	Consider the circle for instance
2014-02-05 05:54:58	imprimable	if its not simply connected
2014-02-05 05:54:59	imprimable	yes
2014-02-05 05:55:01	Cale	right
2014-02-05 05:55:01	imprimable	you have Z map
2014-02-05 05:55:03	imprimable	ok

2014-02-05 05:55:28	imprimable	so its like a group
2014-02-05 05:55:36	Cale	If our space is a pointed space, then we can consider the paths from the base point to the base point

2014-02-05 05:55:53	imprimable	yes

2014-02-05 05:56:10	Cale	which since our category is a groupoid, is the same as the automorphism group

2014-02-05 05:57:09	Cale	Right, yeah, so I suspect there are a lot of such things *actually* in physics

2014-02-05 05:57:35	imprimable	actually, i would like to define a concept
2014-02-05 05:57:40	imprimable	on the category of hilbert space
2014-02-05 05:57:51	Cale	Where you have some local symmetry group at each point in spacetime, and transports between different points

2014-02-05 06:00:23	imprimable	its only relational
2014-02-05 06:00:31	imprimable	so its all about diagrams
2014-02-05 06:05:33	Cale	Yeah, there's a lot of algebraic structure to be had. I know that there are these toy models called topological quantum field theories which somehow are closely related to the things which higher category theorists are working on.

2014-02-05 06:06:36	imprimable	yes but those are models
2014-02-05 06:06:42	imprimable	they are not an algebraic theory of physics
2014-02-05 06:06:58	imprimable	there are "causal sets" theory that is in some sense an algebraic theory of physics
2014-02-05 06:07:00	imprimable	but its too simple
2014-02-05 06:07:09	imprimable	some people gneralized it to "causal site"

2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:45:48] is a pullpack simply a generalization of an equalizer ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:47:22] to me it looks like a generalization of the equalizer for which the two arrows with different domain
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:47:25] prine: yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:47:37] ok thx
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:47:56] so one could also define a pullback for n arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:48:08] And they are all just special instances of limits
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:48:09] Sure
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:48:24] ok, so i guess i should really see what is a limit
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:48:24] :>
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:49:54] It is quite general: limits are things that have a universal property for mapping into them.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:50:04] it's a generalization of an equalizer and a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:50:12] in fact, if you have equalizers and products you have pullbacks
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:50:29] oh yes, i see where you see the product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:50:32] yes ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:50:33] its "both"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:50:35] you're right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:51:05] so the pullback over A and B identifies as a product of A and B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:51:25] That observation is actually really useful. When you consider a limit in some category, it does not hurt to think about an "element" of the limit to be a sequence of objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:51:29] and it is also an equalizer
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:52:00] what is the definition of a limit mr- ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:52:03] so i can see what you mean
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[20:52:10] i.e. in sets: lim A_i is a subset of prod_i A_i
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:55:32] mr-: hm I dont see it :(
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:55:37] how is it true for every limit
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:56:56] prine: imagine you have a diagram. A limit for this diagram is an object O wogether with arrows to all the other objects s.t. the whole thing commutes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[20:57:03] well, from every limit you can project out the A_i's
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:57:30] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:57:33] so its a generalized pullback
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:57:40] its a pullback for every object of the diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:57:45] it's a generalized everything :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:57:51] hm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:57:54] which is also a generalized product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:58:00] well i wouldnt say that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:58:05] it's not a pullback for every object
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[20:58:08] if you can build every limit out of products and pullbacks, iirc?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[20:58:13] s/if//
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:58:23] what about coproduct ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:58:27] A -> Z <- C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:58:33] Z can be a coproduct too isn't it ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[20:58:48] what are hte link between pullback and coproduct ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:59:12] coproduct is an example of a colimit
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:59:15] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_%28category_theory%29
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[20:59:32] http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-413-713/notes/chap05.pdf
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:00:12] a diagram is a functor : where does it sends the object that are not inside the diagrams ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:00:36] A pullback is a limit of the following diagram: https://files.app.net/f6nlaCSR.png
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:00:46] eg an object with arrows, s.t. everything commutes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:00:51] + it's the biggest object
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:01:01] yes i understood qualitatively what is a limit with your definition
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:01:46] but i don't understand how a functor is a diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:01:53] where does it sends the objects that are not inside your diagram ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:02:30] can you send them to "0" ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:02:33] i don't understand
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:03:21] a diagram in the category C is a functor D : I -> C from some "shape" category I
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:03:27] which is usually very simple
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:03:48] oh ok i got it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:04:04] your shape category has no more object that the ones involved in the diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:04:08] and no more arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:04:10] thats it ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:04:19] yea
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:04:34] so D is like a "representation" of I in C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:04:43] you're representing the "abstract" diagram in C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:05:01] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:05:04] got it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:06:58] ah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:07:03] i think thats how you have to do
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:07:16] to explain what it means to be a different kind of product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:07:52] you have your product diagram from I to C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:07:56] and you have two functor
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:07:57] F and G
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:08:02] and two different type of product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:08:06] should be non isomorphic functors ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:08:29] yes this looks to be good
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:09:04] so you have inequivalente representation of a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:09:04] thats it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:09:10] as inequivalent represnetation in group theory
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:09:20] the functor is interpreted as a representation of your diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:09:35] mr-: does this look good for what it means to be a "kind" of product ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:10:19] i guess you need the concept of natural transfomration that i don't know
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:10:26] to explain whqat it means to be isomorphic functor
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:10:29] but thats the idea
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:10:40] and so it is sufficient to "count" the unmber of inequivalent class of isomorphic functor
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:10:48] and you have the number of "kind of product" you have in your category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:11:43] i should look what is a natural transformation first
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:11:44] but i'm sure it works
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:13:54] of course in Set, you would find that every functor from your product diagram I to Set is the same
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:14:05] because all products are of the same kind
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:15:26] do you think it works Saizan ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:18:00] i'm not sure which functors you are trying to compare
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:18:19] two different functor F, G, from I to C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:18:23] where C is a category that admits some products
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:18:31] and I is just the "product category"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:18:43] you have a diagram of a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:19:00] hm, you need the ump "for all object ..."
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:19:02] how cna you code that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:19:36] the functors from I to C just describe which limit you want
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:19:57] they don't build the limit itself
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:20:03] well its a representation of diagram in I in C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:20:26] but it doesnt work as i would like to
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:20:34] because in I, you don't know that you have a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:20:43] yeah, but for example for the product of A and B you'd take I to be the category with two objects and no arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:20:54] ah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:20:55] I see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:21:01] and the diagram would be a functor which sends one object to A adn the other to B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:21:04] and then you take the limit
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:21:17] yes, of the diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:22:01] what i would like to do
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:22:12] is to have a diagram that characterize entirely what it means to be a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:22:21] but looks like you can't
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:22:24] because of the ump
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:22:39] you need to use the limit in the category you map your diagram
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:23:13] what i'm saying would work if there was not the condition "for all object ..."
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:23:37] is there a way to "code" what it means "for all objects" ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:23:41] with functor maybe ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:24:27] well, if C has all the binary products you can have a functor which sends pair of objects to their product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:24:43] yes i know the x functor
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:24:53] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:25:05] but it doesnt tell you anything about the "type" of product it is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:25:16] its just a constructing tool
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:25:23] that doesn't give any information
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:26:07] i mean, there should be a "universal" way to mean "this category C has only one kind of product if it respect such universal property"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:26:57] as far as category theory is concerned there's only one product, every other is isomorphic
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:27:20] i think the best you can ask for is some "evil" property like "the isomorphism must actually be the identity"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:27:27] btw notdan, the link you gave me is just awodey's book in "chapter" right ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:27:45] what i mean by "type" of product Saizan, is for three objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:27:50] take A,B,C be three objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:28:12] suppose you can explicitly construct a product between A and B, call it AxB
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:28:20] all product between A and B are isomorphic to AxB
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:28:38] suppose now, you can construct a product between A and C, call it A.C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:28:45] what i want to do is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:04] "can i universalliy characterize that x and . are not constructed in the same way (modulo isomorphism)"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:05] example
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:15] product in Set is "only" cartesian product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:23] that is, the ordered pair (modulo isomorphisms)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:30] but in another arbitrary category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:40] one can think that you can construct a product AxB as ordered pair
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:49] and a product A.B as like, disjoint union
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:29:53] clearly
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:30:00] x and . are differnet type of products
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:30:05] erm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:30:06] A.C sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:30:15] but in that category x won't be a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:30:37] ehm, sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:30:41] the example i gave is stupid i know, i just want to explain what i mean by kind of product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:30:48] i understand
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:30:52] ie, the construction process (modulo isomorphism) is differnet
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:31:28] but i want to explain that in a category every product will behave the same
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:31:35] how comes ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:32:18] because the definition gives you everything you need to know to manipulate the product categorically, i.e. with morphisms from the category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:32:42] well only between two objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:32:50] you don't know how product behaves with different objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:32:59] (A.B)xC =~ A.(BxC) is the only condition you have to respect
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:33:05] so while there might be different "implementation" details below, the category won't let you care
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:33:06] but clearly this doesn't imply that . = x
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:34:01] i don't understand why
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:34:05] this is true for two same objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:34:07] well, you could try to find an actual category where there are significantly different . and x first
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:34:16] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:34:57] maybe one has to do something with functor . and x
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:35:02] if C has all binary products
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:35:31] then there might be a functor [] that send CxC to C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:35:54] and forms "sometimes" [](A,B) = AxB and "sometimes" [](A,C) = A.C
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:07] so yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:11] maybe one has to look this functor
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:14] to characterize what i want
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:36:20] you could just ask, "are AxB and A.B isomorphic?"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:36] well, AxB and A.B yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:37] its obvious
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:39] because of UMP
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:36:45] sorry, x and .
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:36:46] or you mean as functors ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:36:48] as functors
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:37:01] but they will be isomorphic
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:37:10] for the same reason
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:37:20] so you might want to ask if they are _equal_
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:37:31] no i don't care about equality
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:37:41] what you're telling me is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:37:49] if i find some construction that is a product in a category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:37:58] then this construction will work for every objects (A,B) in this category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:38:01] that admits a product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:38:05] this looks weird
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:38:08] too powerful
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:38:29] it means there is only "ond kind" of product per category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:38:33] how comes ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:38:42] i'm just saying that if you can construct every product, every other way to construct every product will be isomorphic
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:39:03] my question is about the construction process of the product
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:39:16] again, i agree that A.B and AxB is isomorphic because are the same objects
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:39:24] thats just UMP
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:39:36] but for different objects, there's nothing obvious about that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:39:39] the only condition is that it is associative
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:39:45] that's why it seems to me you care about equality, or maybe some other notion in-between
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:40:07] no, i'm looking for "equivalent class of products"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:40:09] in a same category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:40:13] anyhow
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:40:25] you should figure this out yourself at this point :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:40:31] ahah yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:40:36] but i don't know enough concept yet
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:40:42] like limits, natural transformation
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[21:40:59] (myself i don't think it's something meaningful)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:41:14] (why does people always tell me my questions are meaningless :<)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:41:15] prine: I think so
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:41:21] i didnt actually read his book :(
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:41:40] its quite good for non mathematicians like me notdan
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:41:59] People keep telling me that, but I just don't get this book!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[21:42:05] And I am not a mathematician
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:42:33] well, i have to admit at first
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:42:42] i was "scared" that it was too easy and too much "vulgarization"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	prine	[21:42:47] but actually i find it quite rigorous and good
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[21:44:34] notdan: it is true for every limit, because a map from something to the limit is a map from that something to every object such that everything commutes. A map to every object such that everything commutes is an element in the limit of the hom sets.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[22:48:53] notdan: A fun way to picture a limit is just as an object above the diagram you take the limit of. (i.e. as a cone). It is then "clear" what a map to is is supposed to be
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[22:51:32] Hm I understand that this provides us with the existance and associativity stuff for the limits
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[22:51:38] but what about the uniquness
2014-02-05 19:45:52	notdan	[22:51:47] which is also a part of the universal object property
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[22:54:40] i think you want to use the yoneda lemma for that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:17:07] the isomorphism stuff makes me confused about bob harper's comments how uniqueness is an extensionality principle
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:22:53] Contractibility is the new uniqueness.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:27:00] :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:27:22] tac: what i mean tho is that both beta and eta emerge from the iso in identical (well, dual) ways
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:27:48] so i dont know why eta/uniqueness is completely unlike beta where equality is concerned
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:28:06] not sure what you mean
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:29:26] tac: bob harper says that beta rules are somehow more about definitional equality than eta rules are
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:29:50] and that this is related to a kind of principle of extensionality -- eta equivalence is an extensional fact
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:29:51] hm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:30:04] I can maybe believe the smell of that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:30:13] and yet beta and eta come from dual aspects of the isomorphism in CT
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:30:27] From what little I understand, there's an asymmetry between beta and eta that would cause the issue
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:30:29] "dual" in a loose sense
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:30:39] you get them from the different directions of the iso
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:30:39] And that is that eta makes terms bigger, where beta only makes them smaller
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:31:01] for some metric of smallness, sure
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:31:01] It's a matter of computability, I suppose
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:31:17] beta always puts you closer to normal form
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:31:19] computability how? eta is computable. its nearly trivial, in fact
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:31:24] That is definitely not true of eta
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:31:59] it is computable, but it isn't product with respect to type checking.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:32:04] well of course not, beta is normalization, eta is eta-long-ification
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:32:05] productive*
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:32:12] right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:32:16] productive in what sense
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:32:29] beta is critical to typechecking. Eta isn't.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[01:32:39] They are "dual" but they are not equally important.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:32:53] no thats not strictly true
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:33:02] in STLC, you dont need either
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:33:07] they're irrelevant for type checking
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:33:28] for DTLC you need both (often, anyway)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:34:57] agda, at least, makes use of eta contraction in a bunch of places
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[01:35:14] (eta contraction, of course, does make proofs smaller)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:12:33] augur: Hey, can you explain what a "neutral" term generally refers to?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:15:08] tac: i think in general people use neutral to mean WHNF
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:15:27] thanks
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:15:31] it might be able to beta reduce, but not at the outermost level, only internally
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:15:57] i think?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:16:02] or maybe its the other way around
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:16:07] who knows!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:18:05] yeah, i think neutral = WHNF
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:18:13] or maybe it might mean fully normalized
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:18:18] it probably depends on who's using the term
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:18:49] I'm looking through the cubical sets implementation of hott
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:18:56] I'd like to just get the gist of how it works
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:20:49] oh man what a nutty idea
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:21:04] what about it?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:39:54] it looks like a suitable definition would be "a term with no reducible subterms"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:40:25] or hm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:40:30] no that doesn't work for this definition
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:40:48] or maybe it does...
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[02:41:40] no, it does not.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[02:47:10] ill stick to my proof-theory-is-the-semantics approach to life :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:49:25] can someone explains me page59 of awodey's second edition?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:49:32] example 3.9
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:49:48] i don't understand
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:50:58] how can you show that the coproduct of two monoids is of the form A+B = M(|A|+|B|)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:51:04] you have to get it and show that it respects the ump ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:51:09] sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[03:51:21] how can you show that the coproduct of two monoids is of the form A+B = M(|A|+|B|)/equivalent class of the relations
2014-02-05 19:45:52	mr-	[04:11:19] imprimable: yes, you would have to show the universal property - as is mostly done on that page and the next
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:26:35] I think probably it would have been better for him not to have used M as the name of the arbitrary other monoid there :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:30:51] Hah! I didn't know that the fact that the coproduct and product of Abelian groups are isomorphic was first noticed by MacLane, but it makes sense in retrospect.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:31:39] Despite its importance, the coproduct of groups is not something that's easy to think to define without category theory.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[04:32:20] That's the free product, right?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:32:24] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[04:35:28] Cale: wasn't it discovered via van Kampen's theorem?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:35:43] ystael: Quite possibly!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:37:30] If that were the case, then I would suspect the amalgamated free product (i.e. the pushout) to have been defined just before the free product :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[04:38:19] The first book I ever saw a definition of the free product of groups in actually called it the 'amalgamation'
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[04:38:39] I don't remember what book it was, other than it was some first course in algebraic topology
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:41:18] Usually the word amalgamated is used to indicate that G+H has been quotiented to turn it into the pushout of some maps F -> G and F -> H
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[04:42:58] and that shows up directly in van Kampen's theorem, where F is then the fundamental group(oid) of the intersection of the parts you're decomposing the space into
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:06:15] hi
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:06:16] hey ho
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:06:22] okay
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:07:07] So a category consists of the following data (any manner in which we provide this data while following the laws I'll specify will define a category)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:07:40] Actually, I should say "a category C", let's give it a name :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:08:17] So first: a collection Ob(C) of "objects" -- this can literally be any collection we choose
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:08:24] so C is (kind of) a category in the sense that its used in english?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:08:39] It's a technical term
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:08:45] okey
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:09:34] and then for each two objects X and Y in Ob(C), we have a collection of "arrows" written C(X,Y) or Hom_C(X,Y) or Hom(X,Y) depending on who you're talking to
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:09:41] When f is in C(X,Y) we write f: X -> Y
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:09:55] what is f here?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:10:02] anything at all
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:10:09] okey
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:10:11] C(X,Y) is just a collection of things
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:10:22] we get to specify what those things are when we define a category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:10:44] okey
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:10:46] (A lot of the time, they might be functions, but they also might not actually be functions)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:12:16] For each three objects, X, Y, Z in Ob(C) we define a composition: given f in C(Y,Z) and g in C(X,Y), that is, given f: Y -> Z and g: X -> Y, we define:
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:12:26] f . g: X -> Z
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:13:15] i.e. for each pair of arrows f and g which line up, we need to say somehow which arrow in C(X,Z) is their composite
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:14:19] Also, for each object X, we specify an arrow id_X: X -> X
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:14:44] (this also ensures that C(X,X) cannot be an empty collection)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:14:58] Then we have some laws:
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:15:22] If f: X -> Y is any arrow, then f . id_X = f and id_Y . f = f
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:15:43] so, C(X,Y) is equaliant to X -> Y in haskell?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:16:03] C(X,Y) is the collection of arrows X -> Y
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:16:10] okey
2014-02-05 19:45:52	dwcook	[05:16:21] In the category Hask, Haskell functions are indeed the arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	roboguy_	[05:16:24] arrows aren't necessarily functions
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:16:47] dwcook: except that can't support parametric polymorphism or typeclasses
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:16:51] So lastly, before we go on, the final condition is that if f: Z -> W, g: Y -> Z, and h: X -> Y are any arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:17:06] then f . (g . h) = (f . g) . h
2014-02-05 19:45:52	dwcook	[05:17:07] tac, how so?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:18:00] dwcook: Where do you put something of type forall a. a -> a ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:18:10] guys pls...
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:18:12] gonna try a thing
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:18:45] klrr_: If you know what a monoid is, then the identity and associativity should seem familiar. A category is like a monoid where not all of the elements can be multiplied with each other in that respect.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:19:12] (only the arrows which line up head to tail can be composed)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	roboguy_	[05:19:24] tac: would that be some kind of natural transformation?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:19:38] roboguy_: yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	dwcook	[05:19:48] tac, I see your point. Couldn't you say every object has its own though?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:20:08] Yeah, I don't think this discussion is going to help klrr_ here :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	dwcook	[05:20:13] Sorry, I'll be quiet
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:20:15] hmm okey i think im kind of get it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[05:20:30] klrr_: there are categories where the arrows are very unlike functions, so don't get too caught up on the similarity between an arrow C(X,Y) and a function f : X -> Y
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:20:44] The standard way of doing it is to work with fibered categories. Natural transformations are a cute analogy, but they're just that. An analogy.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:20:47] an arrow *in* C(X,Y)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:20:50] but yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[05:20:57] Cale: yep woops
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:21:53] tac: They're a *little* more than an analogy, but yeah, you can't do all polymorphic functions like that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[05:22:22] tac: reference for fibred categories?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:23:08] ystael: Jacobs' book is the only one I know of. Categorical Type Theory.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[05:23:24] tac: thanks, I'll look it up
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:23:24] http://www.cs.ru.nl/B.Jacobs/CLT/bookinfo.html
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[05:23:36] oh, awesome, thank you!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:24:08] klrr_: Okay, so yeah, we can define a category where the objects are (monomorphic) Haskell types, and where the arrows are the Haskell-definable functions between those types.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:25:03] klrr_: and then the identity arrow on each type is given by id (specialised to each type)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[05:25:16] and then we pretend _|_ doesn't exist...
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:25:26] klrr_: and the composition of arrows f: Y -> Z and g: X -> Y is given by f . g
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:25:32] so just id is not a arrow, but a id of the particular type is?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:25:37] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:25:45] okey
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:25:46] (At least, if we're doing this the easy way)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[05:26:01] a -> a is not an arrow, Char -> Char is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[05:26:16] and note that there may be plenty of Char -> Char arrows but only one id
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:26:30] okey, is *any* function for a particular type in the category C an arrow of category C?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:26:49] klrr_: Well, you might not have things which you call functions
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:27:18] klrr_: Note that in my description of what a category is, I specified that certain things are called objects and certain things are called arrows
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:28:10] *Often* if you have some kind of structures, and then structure-preserving functions between them, you can get a category whose objects are those structures, and whose arrows are the structure-preserving functions
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:28:22] are X and Y the objects, or is (X,Y) a collection of object X and Y?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:28:40] X and Y have been objects everywhere that I used those letters
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:29:03] i.e. arbitrary elements of the collection Ob(C)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:29:18] structure-preserving function is some kind of fmap?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:29:34] Well, let's look at an example
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:29:38] how one can find or have the intuition that the coproduct of Monoids A+B is given by a free monoid on |A| + |B| ? i don't understand how its possible to find that alone
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:30:05] imprimable: It's not directly given by that free monoid
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:30:18] yes + quotient by relation
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:30:18] sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:30:43] but how can one "find" that alone ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:30:43] imprimable: The intuition is that the coproduct is as close to a "disjoint union" of monoids as you can get while still being a monoid.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:31:09] Cale: i must thank you very much for explaination, i gotta get to bed got a test early this morning
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:31:10] s/this/tomorrow
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:31:20] klrr_: Okay, ping me if you want to continue later :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	klrr_	[05:31:31] cool, thanks :) nn
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:31:37] g'night!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:31:51] and why would a disjoint union looks like a free monoid quotiented by the relations
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:31:53] i don't understand
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:32:22] because you want to keep all generators from A and B, ok bu this looks "too" powerful
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:32:27] imprimable: So, you know that the coproduct of A and B will have "inclusions" A -> A + B and B -> A + B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:32:59] So, you might start with just the disjoint union of A and B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:33:20] and you know already how to multiply elements of A with elements of A, or elements of B with elements of B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:33:32] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:33:38] but what about elements of A with elements of B, and vice versa?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:33:49] you don't know a priori yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:33:56] still you have to have a monoid
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:34:34] why don't you just suppose they don't talk to each other ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:34:43] So, yeah, we start throwing in new elements for every such combination
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:34:49] Ah, okay
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:34:59] So we're trying to get something universal here
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:36:43] I mean, at the end of the day, it works because it works, but the intuition should be that we shouldn't do anything which depends too much on the particular structure of A and B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:37:23] For any other monoid X and maps A -> X and B -> X, we want to be able to get a homomorphism A + B -> X
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:37:26] is it always possible to construct a "universal construction" of coproduct and product in a given category ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:37:43] no
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:38:07] Many particular categories have all products or all coproducts, but not all of them do.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:38:10] the category needs to have binary podducts yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:38:15] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:38:59] is there some category such that C = C^op ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:39:10] i mean, not trivial ons
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:40:06] So a bit of intuition that I'm not entirely sure how to make formal is that A + B needs to keep a * b separate from anything in the image of A or B because if we do too much identification early on, then when we go to construct this homomorphism out of A + B, things will have been stuck together in a way that we don't want.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:40:35] imprimable: I don't know of too many interesting ones.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:40:44] "hopf" category ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:40:51] imprimable: There's the indiscrete category on a set of objects.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:40:52] such that products and coproduct are self dual ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:41:20] Oh, products and coproducts being the same thing can happen even when C is not equivalent to C^op
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:41:29] ah, ok :>
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:41:33] and indeed, it happens for the category of Abelian groups
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Saizan	[05:41:34] don't groupoids kind of fit C = C^op?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:41:56] Saizan: yeah, they ought to :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:42:04] So, I guess I lied
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:42:07] lol
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:42:09] ahah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:43:24] imprimable: So yeah, if all your arrows are invertible, you get a natural equivalence of C and C^op.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:44:08] so you have a self dual category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:44:08] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:44:49] But then you have the funny thing that (co)products only exist between objects which are isomorphic.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tomprince	[05:45:08] Another example of a category where C = C^{op} is he category of relations.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tomprince	[05:45:25] Since the arrows there don't really have a prefered direction.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:45:34] ah true
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:45:37] they are just subsets
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:45:54] whihc is logical
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:45:56] because of symmetry
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:46:03] it codes the symmetry of teh relation
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:46:06] right, i see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:46:20] e.g. if you're working with a groupoid and you have A and B and their coproduct exists, then you have "inclusions" A -> A + B <- B, but then those are all invertible arrows, and you can invert one of them to get a chain of isomorphisms A -> A+B -> B
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:06] a groupoid is a category in which every object is a group ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:14] ie all morphisms are invertibl
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:14] e
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:47:19] A groupoid is a category in which every arrow has an inverse.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:26] yes i see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:47:31] imprimable: other way around. Every group is a groupoid with one object.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:34] so a monoidoid is just a category
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:47:38] haha, yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	tac	[05:47:43] imprimable: exactly :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:47:46] strange that it is called monoid ahah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ystael	[05:48:05] { mon(oid)^n | n in N }
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:49:50] what is the algebraic idea behind a monoid
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:49:52] erm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:49:54] a groupoid
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:49:57] in terms of "symmetry"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:50:02] if you make it "acts" for example on a set
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:50:29] imprimable: Do you know any topology?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:50:35] yes i do
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:51:29] Okay, so recall that for any space X, and points a and b in X, we have a space of paths from a to b, given by continuous functions p: [0,1] -> X such that p(0) = a and p(1) = b
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:52:10] and we can define two paths p and q from a to b to be equivalent when there's a continuous function H: [0,1] x [0,1] -> X such that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:52:26] H(0,x) = p(x) for all x
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:52:36] H(1,x) = q(x) for all x
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:52:46] H(t,0) = a for all t
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:52:48] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:52:52] H(t,1) = b for all t
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:53:30] Given a space X, we can define a groupoid whose objects are the points in X, and whose arrows are the equivalence classes of paths between those points.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:07] AH
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:08] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:11] i see :>
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:54:26] The identity arrows a -> a are given by the equivalence class containing the constant path, and composition of arrows is defined by concatenating paths.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:34] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:41] and you only have one map from x to y
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:54:49] Not necessarily
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:53] ah yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:54:55] Consider the circle for instance
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:58] if its not simply connected
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:54:59] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:55:01] right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:01] you have Z map
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:03] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:05] i see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:05] :>
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:28] so its like a group
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:55:36] If our space is a pointed space, then we can consider the paths from the base point to the base point
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:37] who has some "different laws" at different "sites"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:55:53] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:55:54] This will be the endomorphism monoid of that base point
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:05] so a groupoid is like a "field of group" in some sense
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:56:10] which since our category is a groupoid, is the same as the automorphism group
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:15] such that you can pass from one point to another
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:56:20] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:23] i see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:56:33] "field" a little like how physicists use the term :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:37] ahah yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:40] i'm a physicist, shh
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:56:40] :>
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:57:09] Right, yeah, so I suspect there are a lot of such things *actually* in physics
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:57:22] yes, thats exactly why i'm tryng to learn category theory
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:57:35] actually, i would like to define a concept
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:57:40] on the category of hilbert space
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[05:57:51] Where you have some local symmetry group at each point in spacetime, and transports between different points
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:57:57] yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:59:13] (thats the concept of gauge invariance)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[05:59:55] i think one shoul reformulate all physics in term of category theory
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:00:21] after all, physics is algebraic
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:00:23] its only relational
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:00:31] so its all about diagrams
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[06:05:33] Yeah, there's a lot of algebraic structure to be had. I know that there are these toy models called topological quantum field theories which somehow are closely related to the things which higher category theorists are working on.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Cale	[06:05:51] (but I don't *really* know the details all that well)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:06:36] yes but those are models
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:06:42] they are not an algebraic theory of physics
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:06:58] there are "causal sets" theory that is in some sense an algebraic theory of physics
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:07:00] but its too simple
2014-02-05 19:45:52	imprimable	[06:07:09] some people gneralized it to "causal site"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	ReinH	[12:42:12] hmm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	copumpkin	[12:43:42] ReinH: indeed!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	carter	[12:47:15] ccomonads!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	carter	[12:47:20] *coco
2014-02-05 19:45:52	augur	[13:33:53] cocomonads are delicious

2014-02-06 04:27:01	imprimable	i stll don't understand how one can see that the coproduct of two monoids, A+B ~ M(|A| + |B|)/~ where ~ is some well chosen relations
2014-02-06 04:27:24	imprimable	i understand why it is the case so, i can check the proof and understand that it indeed works
2014-02-06 04:27:38	imprimable	but why would someone want A+B to be isomorphic to M(|A| + |B|)/~  ?

2014-02-06 04:35:14	Saizan	i can't say that i've used the coproduct of monoids before, but still it's not a matter of wanting
2014-02-06 04:35:20	Saizan	it just is
2014-02-06 04:35:58	imprimable	how can you FIND that it is that
2014-02-06 04:36:42	tac	Hmm
2014-02-06 04:37:09	tac	I might be overgeneralizing from groups, but I think it should be the case that every monoid can be presented as a free monoid, modulo some relations
2014-02-06 04:37:28	tac	When you have M(|A| + |B|), you are guaranteed to have all of the original generators of both A and B.
2014-02-06 04:37:49	imprimable	yes, but its really "strong"
2014-02-06 04:37:56	tac	How so?
2014-02-06 04:38:05	tac	A is a quotient of a free monoid, B is too
2014-02-06 04:38:16	imprimable	how
2014-02-06 04:38:17	tac	|A| contains the generators of A (plus lots of other crap)... so does |B|
2014-02-06 04:38:25	tac	how is A a quotient of a free monoid?

2014-02-06 04:38:27	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 04:38:40	imprimable	what is the relation ?
2014-02-06 04:39:43	imprimable	a and b are equivalent iff a = a_1 a_2 a_3 ... and b = a_2 b_1 ... b_3 ?
2014-02-06 04:39:55	-->	roboguy_ (~roboguy_@207.59.124.24.cm.sunflower.com) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-02-06 04:40:03	tac	Well, if the proof works the same for groups
2014-02-06 04:40:24	imprimable	you want to "throw" out all the shit that comes after the first generator
2014-02-06 04:40:33	imprimable	but there are arbitrary length word
2014-02-06 04:40:36	imprimable	so how does it works
2014-02-06 04:41:00	tac	I think you start with proving an equivalent of the first iso theorem for monoids
2014-02-06 04:41:33	imprimable	ok, and you define a morphism that only keep the first letter
2014-02-06 04:42:13	imprimable	how is that a morphism
2014-02-06 04:42:17	imprimable	wait
2014-02-06 04:42:22	tac	You aren't following what I'm saying
2014-02-06 04:42:49	imprimable	firsti so theorem : G/Ker f ~ Imf ?
2014-02-06 04:42:57	tac	Yeah.
2014-02-06 04:43:01	imprimable	what next
2014-02-06 04:43:10	tac	And if f is surjective, then G/ker f = H   for G -> H
2014-02-06 04:43:44	tac	You figure out a free group that can surject onto your monoid
2014-02-06 04:44:35	imprimable	what is the definition of a free group as a group
2014-02-06 04:44:48	tac	it's the same definition as that of a free monoid
2014-02-06 04:44:55	tac	replacing the category of groups with the cat of monoids
2014-02-06 04:45:03	imprimable	you mean, the universal property ?
2014-02-06 04:45:11	tac	yeah
2014-02-06 04:45:24	imprimable	ok but, is there a way to define that with set and relations
2014-02-06 04:46:04	imprimable	is the free group M(G) isomorph to the "free set" generated by |G| modulo commutation relations ?
2014-02-06 04:46:22	tac	err
2014-02-06 04:46:31	tac	M is your free monoid functor
2014-02-06 04:46:55	imprimable	is the free monoid M(G) isomorph to ...
2014-02-06 04:47:43	imprimable	or is there something "more" in the free monoid ?
2014-02-06 04:48:15	tac	Try this
2014-02-06 04:48:33	tac	You have a monoid N
2014-02-06 04:48:49	tac	You have the free monoid on |N|, yeah?
2014-02-06 04:48:57	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 04:49:11	tac	Now, we have the identity function on |N|, right?
2014-02-06 04:49:14	tac	|N| -> |N|
2014-02-06 04:49:18	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 04:49:34	tac	we can "lift" that to a monoid homomorphism from the free monoid on N to N
2014-02-06 04:49:36	imprimable	so you can "lift" it up to M(|N|)
2014-02-06 04:49:38	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 04:49:46	tac	And it will surject, right?
2014-02-06 04:49:47	imprimable	which means you can inject
2014-02-06 04:49:48	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 04:49:59	tac	Why does it surject?
2014-02-06 04:50:17	imprimable	well because diagram commutes
2014-02-06 04:50:21	imprimable	and id is iso
2014-02-06 04:50:41	tac	right
2014-02-06 04:51:01	imprimable	but i can't see what are the elements of the kernel
2014-02-06 04:51:08	Cale	Oh, yeah, I suppose it's worth mentioning that every monoid or every group can be obtained as a quotient of a free monoid or group.
2014-02-06 04:51:08	imprimable	could you explicit them ?
2014-02-06 04:51:15	tac	So you have a surjection, and assuming the first hom theorem holds for monoids, N is equal to a quotient of the free monoid on N
2014-02-06 04:51:35	Cale	(I'm still back at the start of this thread)
2014-02-06 04:51:41	tac	imprimable: So you've proven they exist at least. That's usually a good first step ;)
2014-02-06 04:51:50	tac	If something doesn't exist, you usually have a hard time finding it
2014-02-06 04:51:54	imprimable	yes thats true
2014-02-06 04:52:08	imprimable	but i like expliciting things to have better "vision"
2014-02-06 04:52:17	tac	Sure
2014-02-06 04:52:19	Cale	imprimable: Is your worry that this method might not generalise to other categories?
2014-02-06 04:52:22	imprimable	here i can't see the "form" of the morphism from the free monoid to
2014-02-06 04:52:23	imprimable	N
2014-02-06 04:52:30	tac	Well then, you can figure out the kernel if you know the monoid involved
2014-02-06 04:52:42	imprimable	Cale: no, it would work for every concrete category that has a ump for "free struture"
2014-02-06 04:52:50	imprimable	but i don't understnad WHY it is so
2014-02-06 04:53:20	Cale	imprimable: Well, do you agree with the proof that it has the universal property required?
2014-02-06 04:53:31	imprimable	yes i do, i understand the proof
2014-02-06 04:53:33	tac	When I first saw your problem, I wondered if many it's a consequence of RAPL (Right Adjoints Preserve Limits)
2014-02-06 04:53:44	imprimable	but to prove it you need to exhibit the correct object, so you hve to guess it first
2014-02-06 04:53:46	Cale	and you know that every coproduct of two objects in a category is isomorphic to every other one
2014-02-06 04:53:58	imprimable	yes i do too
2014-02-06 04:54:00	Cale	So, you just have to be right once :)
2014-02-06 04:54:03	imprimable	yes i know
2014-02-06 04:54:08	imprimable	but i don't understand WHY it is the right one
2014-02-06 04:54:11	imprimable	how can one could find it
2014-02-06 04:54:27	imprimable	so of course, if every monoid is a quotient of the free monoid on its set
2014-02-06 04:54:37	imprimable	i understand why you have to go to a free monoid
2014-02-06 04:54:50	imprimable	but why M(|A|+|B|) and not M(|A+B|) ?
2014-02-06 04:55:04	Cale	A+B is what you're trying to define
2014-02-06 04:55:11	imprimable	hm thats true
2014-02-06 04:55:11	tac	imprimable: My guess would be that either would work
2014-02-06 04:55:19	tac	If you're not trying to define the thing, of course :)
2014-02-06 04:55:25	tac	|A+B| still has all the generators you want.
2014-02-06 04:55:32	imprimable	yes it does
2014-02-06 04:55:33	imprimable	thats why
2014-02-06 04:55:35	Cale	So defining A+B = M(|A+B|)/~ would be weirdly circular :)
2014-02-06 04:55:39	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 04:55:50	imprimable	in some sense yes
2014-02-06 04:55:52	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 04:56:02	tac	Cale: It's not a definition, necessarily though. As a proposition between two previously defined things, it's not a terrible statement to make.
2014-02-06 04:56:09	tac	At the very least, it's likely true, even!
2014-02-06 04:56:09	Cale	yes
2014-02-06 04:56:18	Cale	It is true, if you choose ~ correctly
2014-02-06 04:56:37	imprimable	ok so, let me find the kernel of the surjection we defined previously
2014-02-06 04:56:46	tac	Define ~ to be the messy bits in the guts of the proof. QED.
2014-02-06 04:58:07	tomprince	Ther kernel of M(|A|)->A ?
2014-02-06 04:58:20	imprimable	yes

2014-02-06 04:59:49	tomprince	So, what does M(|A|) look like? It is the free monoid on the elements of. So, given a \in A, there is a generator of |A| called |a|. And M(|A|) is the formal linear combinations of those.
2014-02-06 04:59:52	Cale	Oh god, why do I want to explain this by analogy with higher inductive types?

2014-02-06 05:00:22	tomprince	So, before we define the kernel, we should define the map.
2014-02-06 05:00:40	tomprince	s/formal linear combinations/strings of/
2014-02-06 05:00:42	imprimable	we can map the 1 string to N
2014-02-06 05:00:52	imprimable	and the empty string to u_N
2014-02-06 05:01:01	imprimable	so you have an obvious surjection there
2014-02-06 05:01:15	imprimable	if a_1 is a 1 string, f(a_1) = a_1
2014-02-06 05:01:45	Cale	imprimable: You can think of the union of |A| and |B| in the free part as just expressing the idea that we want everything in A and B to have some kind of image in the monoid that we're constructing. After all, coproducts in Set are disjoint unions, so it makes sense to somehow begin with the disjoint union of the underlying sets of A and B.

2014-02-06 05:02:28	Cale	imprimable: and so we take the free monoid on that, just to immediately insist that we have a monoid at all
2014-02-06 05:02:31	imprimable	therefore, a_1. ... .a_N = u_N
2014-02-06 05:02:43	imprimable	therefore, the set of element such that a_1. ... a_N = u_N

2014-02-06 05:03:48	imprimable	yes Cale I understand that
2014-02-06 05:03:48	Cale	and then worry about how that monoid has too many things in it -- in particular, it doesn't at first respect the way that elements of A multiply with each other, or elements of B
2014-02-06 05:04:07	Cale	er, sorry, or elements of B multiply with each other, I mean
2014-02-06 05:04:12	imprimable	i needed to know another "universal" property of the free moniid : every monoid is isomorphic to a quotient of it
2014-02-06 05:04:26	imprimable	if you know that then it doesnt matter to take "the biggest structure"
2014-02-06 05:04:29	imprimable	just find the good equivalent relation
2014-02-06 05:04:33	Cale	right

2014-02-06 05:05:30	imprimable	i have a question
2014-02-06 05:05:34	Cale	Well, every monoid is isomorphic to a quotient of *some* free monoid. So I guess we might not have picked a big enough basis set, but in this case, the choice of |A| + |B| is quite natural to make.
2014-02-06 05:05:36	imprimable	i think i don't understand what a free monoid is
2014-02-06 05:05:44	tac	imprimable: it's a list

2014-02-06 05:05:54	Cale	It's a set of lists under concatenation
2014-02-06 05:05:59	Cale	:)
2014-02-06 05:06:02	imprimable	so there's no identification like
2014-02-06 05:06:06	tac	imprimable: If your underlying set are the integers, the free monoid is the set of all finite lists of integers
2014-02-06 05:06:09	imprimable	ab = c iif a.b = c in the monoid
2014-02-06 05:06:29	imprimable	its just a set of string without any relation
2014-02-06 05:06:33	Cale	yeah
2014-02-06 05:06:44	imprimable	ok so
2014-02-06 05:06:54	imprimable	morphism FROM the free monoid to "smaller" stucture are easy
2014-02-06 05:07:01	imprimable	but morphism from smaller structure to the free monoids
2014-02-06 05:07:02	imprimable	are hard ?

2014-02-06 05:07:22	imprimable	because f : N -> M(|N|) should respect f(a.b) = f(a) f(b)
2014-02-06 05:07:23	Cale	So, the elements of M(|A| + |B|) are just lists of elements of A or of B, and that'll be infinite even if A and B are both the trivial monoid with just their respective identity elements.
2014-02-06 05:07:24	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-06 05:07:39	Cale	yes
2014-02-06 05:07:43	Cale	That's right
2014-02-06 05:07:49	imprimable	so there's only one morphism

2014-02-06 05:08:03	imprimable	which is the canoninal injection modulo S_n ?
2014-02-06 05:08:07	tomprince	Well, so they have to map everything that isn't free to the identity.
2014-02-06 05:08:09	Cale	So, yeah, that's one way to see the reason for taking the quotient as we did

2014-02-06 05:09:58	Cale	One map where?
2014-02-06 05:10:02	imprimable	from A to A+B
2014-02-06 05:10:22	Cale	There might be many in general, but we need a specific one if A + B is to be a coproduct.
2014-02-06 05:10:37	imprimable	how can there be "many" if it has to be a homomorphism
2014-02-06 05:10:48	imprimable	it looks "hard" to have a homomorphism in this direction
2014-02-06 05:10:58	Cale	and the reason we started with the free monoid on |A| + |B| was so that we could be certain to have natural places to send elements of A and elements of B

2014-02-06 05:11:58	Cale	but then we find out immediately that it's hard to make a homomorphism from A to M(|A| + |B|), in order for the map we're thinking of to be a homomorphism, there are certain things in M(|A| + |B|) which need to be identified with each other.

2014-02-06 05:12:16	imprimable	yes so i'm right to think thats its hard to make such homomorphism
2014-02-06 05:12:23	Cale	and that (and its analogue for B) is what creates the equivalence relation ~
2014-02-06 05:12:27	imprimable	thats why you need to identify elements <=> quotient
2014-02-06 05:12:30	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 05:12:32	imprimable	i got it
2014-02-06 05:12:35	tomprince	I'm not sure what you mean by "hard"?
2014-02-06 05:12:37	-->	conehead (~conehead@unaffiliated/conehead) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-02-06 05:12:41	imprimable	"hard" in the sense, there are not a lot
2014-02-06 05:12:45	imprimable	lots of restriction
2014-02-06 05:13:06	Cale	tomprince: Well, without the quotient, the inclusion we're thinking of won't be a monoid homomorphism
2014-02-06 05:13:26	Cale	I'm pretty sure that's what imprimable means :)
2014-02-06 05:13:39	imprimable	yes exactly
2014-02-06 05:13:40	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 05:14:43	Cale	But yeah, also, because there are many elements of M(|A| + |B|) and not many relations, it's "hard" to make a homomorphism into this monoid, in a similar way that it's "hard" for functions to a discrete space to be continuous.
2014-02-06 05:15:05	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 05:15:08	mr-	Why is everybody thinking about monoids lately?
2014-02-06 05:15:17	noteventime	I was just asking myself the same thing :P
2014-02-06 05:15:23	Cale	mr-: because imprimable is in that part of Awodey's text
2014-02-06 05:15:25	tac	mr-: why wouldn't they be? Everyone should know about monoids
2014-02-06 05:15:37	imprimable	(exactly)
2014-02-06 05:15:42	noteventime	I thought it was due to the new catsters video
2014-02-06 05:15:51	Cale	The one about ends?
2014-02-06 05:15:55	noteventime	Yes
2014-02-06 05:16:06	noteventime	He does the Tanaka reconstruction-ish thing
2014-02-06 05:16:10	Cale	yeah
2014-02-06 05:16:36	mr-	tac: I don't mind, I was just wondering. I think there were at least 3 people talking about free monoids this week
2014-02-06 05:17:23	noteventime	Which is pretty neat btw, I hadn't thought of Nat(Id, Id) capturing symmetries of a category, put a new spin on natural transformations for me
2014-02-06 05:17:41	Cale	I think the section on monoids and the UMP for the free monoid etc. is the first really tough bit for beginners reading Awodey's text.
2014-02-06 05:17:54	Cale	There might be something which could be done to make it more digestible.
2014-02-06 05:18:08	Cale	I've seen lots of people get stuck on it.
2014-02-06 05:18:35	imprimable	well, itsn ot obvious to "induce" the good resulting structure
2014-02-06 05:18:37	imprimable	checking it is ok
2014-02-06 05:18:40	imprimable	but thats turing machin proof
2014-02-06 05:19:03	Cale	imprimable: It's also not easy to explain how to invent this, because it becomes somewhat of a standard trick.
2014-02-06 05:19:12	imprimable	i see
2014-02-06 05:19:15	Cale	(which you'd eventually apply without thinking in a new setting)
2014-02-06 05:19:19	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 05:19:27	imprimable	i guess my math skill is too low to understand it directly
2014-02-06 05:20:03	Cale	Another example would be the construction of the tensor product of vector spaces
2014-02-06 05:20:18	noteventime	Cale: Groking UMP (or any similar thing) is pretty much tantamount to understanding structuralist approaches to mathematics (or, at least, the kind of structuralist approaches captured by the way most people seem to do category theory), so I think you'd generally expect it to be a big step
2014-02-06 05:20:42	imprimable	yes, the tensorial algebra
2014-02-06 05:20:43	Cale	Where you take the gigantic vector space which has V x W as a basis
2014-02-06 05:20:46	noteventime	Unless you were raised in that tradition :)
2014-02-06 05:20:58	Cale	and then you quotient that by everything that's required to make pairing bilinear
2014-02-06 05:21:09	imprimable	yes ok
2014-02-06 05:21:26	imprimable	there are 2 ways to construct tensor product
2014-02-06 05:21:28	imprimable	UMP
2014-02-06 05:21:30	imprimable	or this one
2014-02-06 05:21:31	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-06 05:21:50	imprimable	i prefer the UMP for tensor product
2014-02-06 05:21:53	Cale	Well, yeah, but you need this to be able to show that the UMP is actually satisfied by something.
2014-02-06 05:22:04	imprimable	yes, that its not describing nothing
2014-02-06 05:22:05	imprimable	thats true
2014-02-06 05:22:18	imprimable	then you cn construct the tensor algebra as the "free structure" on vector space
2014-02-06 05:22:23	imprimable	and construct everything from here
2014-02-06 05:22:32	imprimable	but i didn't knwo you could theroetically construct "any" algebra
2014-02-06 05:22:35	imprimable	from this one
2014-02-06 05:22:59	imprimable	in somse sese its obvious, just quotient by the relations
2014-02-06 05:23:04	imprimable	so yes
2014-02-06 05:23:31	Cale	Actually, you can define a vector algebra in terms of maps eta: F -> A and mu: A (x) A -> A
2014-02-06 05:23:39	Cale	linear maps
2014-02-06 05:23:53	Cale	So, eta picks out the unit, and mu is the algebra multiplication
2014-02-06 05:24:16	imprimable	what is F
2014-02-06 05:24:19	imprimable	the field ?
2014-02-06 05:24:20	Cale	The field
2014-02-06 05:24:25	imprimable	yes ok
2014-02-06 05:24:28	Cale	eta(1) is the thing you'd normally think of as the unit for multiplication
2014-02-06 05:24:32	imprimable	yes i know
2014-02-06 05:24:37	imprimable	its the same thing when you construct hopf algebra
2014-02-06 05:24:43	Cale	right, yeah
2014-02-06 05:24:43	--	[mth]_away のニックネームが変更され [mth] になりました
2014-02-06 05:24:52	imprimable	i guess thats where i first understood the "power"
2014-02-06 05:24:53	Cale	That just goes another step
2014-02-06 05:24:57	imprimable	of diagrammatic characterization
2014-02-06 05:24:57	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 05:25:22	Cale	The sort of algebra I'm talking about here is a "monoid object in the monoidal category of vector spaces with tensor product"
2014-02-06 05:26:13	Cale	and a Hopf algebra in the classical sense is a "group object in the monoidal category of vector spaces with tensor product"
2014-02-06 05:26:58	imprimable	i can't say "i see"
2014-02-06 05:26:58	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 05:27:21	Cale	Well, it won't be too long, depending on the order in which you study things :)
2014-02-06 05:27:36	Cale	Do you know about the Catsters' videos on youtube?
2014-02-06 05:27:50	imprimable	yes, i don't like them
2014-02-06 05:27:57	imprimable	its too much "out of context"
2014-02-06 05:28:04	Cale	Once you have a good handle on functors and perhaps natural transformations, then you can start watching those
2014-02-06 05:28:20	imprimable	i will try
2014-02-06 05:28:22	Cale	At least, that's the point in which there's some order you could watch them in and have them all make sense :)
2014-02-06 05:28:38	Cale	But they're a bit jumbled up
2014-02-06 05:29:04	imprimable	what does jumbled up means ?
2014-02-06 05:29:06	Cale	However, the ones on monads that were first uploaded really are a good place to begin
2014-02-06 05:29:32	Cale	I mean, the order in which they uploaded the videos isn't an order in which someone who was new to this stuff would want to watch them all.
2014-02-06 05:29:38	imprimable	ah yes, totally
2014-02-06 05:30:02	Cale	I think there's a guide somewhere
2014-02-06 05:30:40	imprimable	well, i'm trying to understand the full avodey's book first
2014-02-06 05:30:45	imprimable	then i would like to understand topois
2014-02-06 05:32:43	tac	I would like to understand toposes too, but I have been told by too many people that I will be accused of voodoo if I do
2014-02-06 05:32:50	imprimable	ahah why
2014-02-06 05:33:42	tac	It's just the impression I get from people :)
2014-02-06 05:34:00	tac	It's so far removed from what people might consider "useful mathematics"
2014-02-06 05:34:09	imprimable	oh, well, like logic
2014-02-06 05:34:17	imprimable	logic is so "hated" by mathematicians
2014-02-06 05:34:20	imprimable	i don't understand why
2014-02-06 05:34:37	tac	I think the feeling is that you end up spending a lot of time saying very very much about so so little
2014-02-06 05:34:56	imprimable	yes i see, lots of theory for "not a lot of explicit results"
2014-02-06 05:35:31	imprimable	well at least its a try to say something theoretically
2014-02-06 05:35:33	tac	I think it also has to do with the historic connection between logic and philosophy
2014-02-06 05:35:36	imprimable	still better than simple computation
2014-02-06 05:36:24	Cale	Yeah, mathematicians generally find philosophers intolerable.
2014-02-06 05:36:28	imprimable	well, thats why its interesting
2014-02-06 05:36:32	imprimable	logic, philo, physics
2014-02-06 05:36:37	imprimable	its "deep", right ?
2014-02-06 05:36:37	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 05:36:47	tac	My personal feelings on deep...
2014-02-06 05:36:50	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 05:36:56	tac	Take an average person, teach them the liar's paradox
2014-02-06 05:37:11	tac	They will be blown away. Fascinated by the paradoxical nature of it.
2014-02-06 05:37:19	tac	It must be deep. It must MEAN something SIGNIFICANT!
2014-02-06 05:37:23	imprimable	well, liar paradox is deep
2014-02-06 05:37:28	imprimable	its a diagonal argument
2014-02-06 05:37:32	tac	Then, a week later, explain the Curry Howard Isomorphism.
2014-02-06 05:37:32	imprimable	and a diagonal argumetn is deep
2014-02-06 05:37:43	Cale	(Personally, I think philosophy needs to shape up as a discipline -- it's much too informal on average, and people throw around different notions of truth and meanings for words without being careful enough to distinguish which one they mean.)
2014-02-06 05:37:48	tac	Explain that "paradox" is just another way of interpreting "you got stuck in an infinite loop in your computer program"
2014-02-06 05:37:59	imprimable	yes, its a diagonal argument tac
2014-02-06 05:38:03	tac	No one learning to program has _ever_ felt having to terminate their program with Ctrl+C is "deep"
2014-02-06 05:38:29	imprimable	well, halting problem is deep
2014-02-06 05:38:33	imprimable	because its a diagonal argument
2014-02-06 05:38:53	tac	It's just using inconsistent logic.
2014-02-06 05:39:02	imprimable	diagonal argument is not inconsistent
2014-02-06 05:39:04	tac	It's assuming that you've found a square circle.
2014-02-06 05:39:07	imprimable	its about incompleteness
2014-02-06 05:39:23	imprimable	it means "what are you asking is too strong"
2014-02-06 05:39:25	Cale	imprimable: tac is assuming you know some stuff that you probably don't
2014-02-06 05:39:34	imprimable	ah, thats possible
2014-02-06 05:39:34	Cale	tac: imprimable is a physicist, not a programmer ;)
2014-02-06 05:39:40	tac	gotcha
2014-02-06 05:40:04	Cale	imprimable: There's a connection between programs and proofs, types and propositions.
2014-02-06 05:40:17	imprimable	curry howard correspondance yes, i heard about it
2014-02-06 05:40:21	Cale	imprimable: and general recursion corresponds to inconsistency of logic
2014-02-06 05:40:26	imprimable	ahah ok
2014-02-06 05:40:39	tac	Turing completeness means inconsistency as a logic.
2014-02-06 05:40:43	Cale	You get a fixpoint combinator of type (A -> A) -> A with which you can prove anything
2014-02-06 05:41:06	Cale	Read logically, that's "If A implies A, then A"
2014-02-06 05:41:18	imprimable	ok, so you can prove everything
2014-02-06 05:41:22	imprimable	because A implies A is always true
2014-02-06 05:41:25	tac	yep
2014-02-06 05:41:25	Cale	right :)
2014-02-06 05:41:29	imprimable	so we say the same
2014-02-06 05:41:35	imprimable	its about incompletness
2014-02-06 05:41:35	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 05:41:36	Cale	But that proof you get is just an infinite loop :)

2014-02-06 05:42:28	imprimable	physics is "incomplete" too

2014-02-06 05:43:19	imprimable	bad from now on
2014-02-06 05:43:26	imprimable	you can check algebraic QFT where it is "good"
2014-02-06 05:43:31	NikolajK	tac: which subject?
2014-02-06 05:43:31	imprimable	otherwise some people use it for "realism QM"
2014-02-06 05:43:32	tac	I know Baez pushes that sentiment pretty hard, but I have yet to see anything I can really understand
2014-02-06 05:44:04	imprimable	well, physics is essentially about "relations" between "objects"
2014-02-06 05:44:06	NikolajK	Baez switched fields now though, right
2014-02-06 05:44:12	imprimable	you never know what are the objects, you only see the relations
2014-02-06 05:44:12	Cale	tac: There's apparently a sense in which Feynman diagrams can really be seen as 2-categorical string diagrams
2014-02-06 05:44:19	imprimable	so in some sense, physics is algebraic (or categoric)
2014-02-06 05:44:31	imprimable	but physicist are too "realists"
2014-02-06 05:44:41	imprimable	they think too much as "object is .." rather than "the relations between this and that is"
2014-02-06 05:44:41	Cale	But I don't really understand Feynman diagrams well enough to explain that :)
2014-02-06 05:44:59	imprimable	feynman diagrams are just a way to code some terms of a divergent serie
2014-02-06 05:45:11	imprimable	they are "numbers"
2014-02-06 05:45:26	tac	Well, they are states, aren't they?
2014-02-06 05:45:27	Cale	They're more than just numbers, they actually encode the whole interaction which may take place.
2014-02-06 05:45:37	tac	Possible ways for an experiment to happen, and each gets their own amplitude?
2014-02-06 05:45:39	imprimable	yes, the full serie is supposed to, but its divergent
2014-02-06 05:45:54	imprimable	tac: actually, no, you have a serie in power of the "coupling"
2014-02-06 05:45:58	imprimable	and the full interaction is a black box
2014-02-06 05:46:17	imprimable	but this black box can be interpreted as, first order in couplage constant ( some feynman diagramss of first order) + second order, ....
2014-02-06 05:46:28	tac	I thought each diagram corresponded to something that might happen in that black box

2014-02-06 05:47:10	NikolajK	the modern approaches of mathematicans to understand Feynman diagrams are hardly a good way to learn about them first, at least if you want to get to understand the literature
2014-02-06 05:48:11	imprimable	i think physics should be entirely reformulated in a purely algebraic/relational way

2014-02-06 05:51:30	NikolajK	I'm a physicist, watch your mouth :)
2014-02-06 05:51:32	Cale	imprimable: Has it produced effective predictions?
2014-02-06 05:51:32	imprimable	http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0204014v1.pdf page 4 explains it very well
2014-02-06 05:51:36	Cale	NikolajK: so is imprimable
2014-02-06 05:51:53	imprimable	Cale: yes, but it doesn't explain anything, and it is proven to be 100% inconsistent mathematically
2014-02-06 05:51:54	NikolajK	(remark tac, Cale: I'm actually NickKidman, if anyone rememers, had to change name)
2014-02-06 05:52:38	NikolajK	what are you guys talking about right now?
2014-02-06 05:52:45	Cale	imprimable: If you can turn a crank and get predictions that work, then there must be something to it. Mathematical inconsistency is bad, but if what is being done can be reduced somehow to an algorithm, then I'd accept it :)
2014-02-06 05:52:52	NikolajK	QFT has the predictions which are tested better than any other theory in history
2014-02-06 05:53:12	imprimable	Cale: well, i think that the "turn" people took in physics is really bad
2014-02-06 05:53:31	imprimable	predictions over understanding "why", and trying to find good interpretations
2014-02-06 05:53:48	NikolajK	QFT isn't inconsistent in the sense of "1+1=2 \land 1+1=3\land 2\neq 3"
2014-02-06 05:53:49	imprimable	there is at the moment, no constructive way to formulate QM from first principle
2014-02-06 05:54:17	NikolajK	what
2014-02-06 05:54:21	NikolajK	depends on what you want to do
2014-02-06 05:54:24	imprimable	and people are "rushing" toward "quantum gravity" and stuf, without having a relevant physical formulation of QM
2014-02-06 05:54:33	imprimable	a construction of QM as special/general relativity is constructed
2014-02-06 05:54:40	imprimable	from first physical/philosophical principle
2014-02-06 05:54:53	imprimable	and i'm cnvince this can be done with a relational paradigm
2014-02-06 05:55:29	NikolajK	in physics, you want to be able to build bomb. you don't want to wait and think about stuff for 40 years and see what it implies
2014-02-06 05:55:37	imprimable	sorry, thats what you think
2014-02-06 05:55:38	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 05:55:52	NikolajK	"think"
2014-02-06 05:55:55	imprimable	yes
2014-02-06 05:56:03	NikolajK	nah I mean that's how some people are motivated
2014-02-06 05:56:24	imprimable	yes, most people are motived like that
2014-02-06 05:56:38	imprimable	but thats not what physics is all about
2014-02-06 05:56:45	NikolajK	I really like foundational work in physics, in fact I'm not particularly interested in applications - but "rushed to X without having the right math for Y" is not a valid criticism
2014-02-06 05:57:04	imprimable	well, its not right maths ! its right interpretation
2014-02-06 05:57:07	imprimable	right paradigm
2014-02-06 05:57:17	imprimable	i'm convinced that physics need a fully relational paradigm
2014-02-06 05:57:17	NikolajK	people want to do stuff irl, that's why they come up with pertubation theory etc. even if there is no mathamtical underpinning, and that's right the way it is
2014-02-06 05:57:32	imprimable	and relational paradigm can be done with category theory
2014-02-06 05:57:51	imprimable	even special relativity can be understood in a relational paradigm
2014-02-06 05:58:07	tac	NikolajK: right. Each diagram gives you a complex amplitude, and to find the total amplitude, you add them up.
2014-02-06 05:58:18	imprimable	physics is all about "compatibility conditions" between the different observers
2014-02-06 05:58:19	imprimable	its relational
2014-02-06 05:58:31	NikolajK	I'm all on your side with "what we want out of phyiscs is..." but it's not reasonable to complain about the fact that some people do this and that because they need numbers within their lifetime
2014-02-06 05:58:32	imprimable	you don't care "what" or "who" is the observer, you just want them to agree when they meet
2014-02-06 05:58:57	tac	the numbers approach to looking at things was the only way of looking at them for a long, long time
2014-02-06 05:58:59	imprimable	well, i wouldn't whine if the academi world wouldn't be "infested" from such people
2014-02-06 05:59:06	tac	You can't expect people to drop analysis for algebra so quickly :)
2014-02-06 06:00:17	NikolajK	does somebody know how to delete accounts from jabber?
2014-02-06 06:00:42	NikolajK	and is there any good argument that the usual definition of a graph (in graph theory) - namely in terms of a set of vertices and a set of edges - isn't a good one?
2014-02-06 06:01:15	Cale	NikolajK: Well, what do you mean by "good" there?
2014-02-06 06:01:18	imprimable	set of vertices + set of edges + the two maps ?
2014-02-06 06:01:43	NikolajK	why two maps?
2014-02-06 06:01:48	NikolajK	ah
2014-02-06 06:01:49	Cale	NikolajK: source and target
2014-02-06 06:01:57	imprimable	i would say that this definition is actually perfect
2014-02-06 06:02:08	NikolajK	the book I have here does it with one map phi(e)={u,v}
2014-02-06 06:02:10	imprimable	it is relational
2014-02-06 06:02:16	NikolajK	undirected graph
2014-02-06 06:02:31	tac	NikolajK: Yeah. That seems like a perfectly fine definition to me
2014-02-06 06:02:32	imprimable	the good definition is the one with source and target
2014-02-06 06:02:39	imprimable	without defining what is the set E and V
2014-02-06 06:02:51	imprimable	you can characterize entirely what it means to be a graph
2014-02-06 06:02:53	imprimable	purely relational
2014-02-06 06:02:55	Cale	imprimable: Well, for directed graphs
2014-02-06 06:03:01	imprimable	true
2014-02-06 06:03:07	NikolajK	I got the book from the recommended list on MathOverflow
2014-02-06 06:03:11	NikolajK	seems good
2014-02-06 06:03:14	tac	What book? NikolajK
2014-02-06 06:03:16	NikolajK	but the first page does something I don't like
2014-02-06 06:03:22	Cale	NikolajK: what in particular?
2014-02-06 06:03:27	NikolajK	(Graph Theory by Bondy and Murty)
2014-02-06 06:04:27	Cale	I mean what in particular don't you like?
2014-02-06 06:04:28	NikolajK	quote: "A graph G is an oredered pair (V(G),E(G)) consisting of a..."
2014-02-06 06:04:40	Cale	I see "ordered triple ..."
2014-02-06 06:04:50	Cale	http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/jozef/LTCC/Graph_Theory_Bondy_Murty.pdf
2014-02-06 06:05:24	tac	looks like an older version, Cale. Amazon shows differently
2014-02-06 06:05:44	tac	NikolajK: what's wrong with that?
2014-02-06 06:05:47	Cale	You could just consider E(G) to be a set of unordered pairs of elements of V(G)
2014-02-06 06:06:00	NikolajK	hehe, I have the 2008 edition here and it's a pair
2014-02-06 06:06:02	Cale	That's really common, and it works fairly well.
2014-02-06 06:07:22	NikolajK	yeah, what I don't like is that they write "G=(proj1(G),proj2(G)), where the image of proj1(G) has the property that..."
2014-02-06 06:07:56	tac	what do you have against surjective pairing?
2014-02-06 06:08:01	tac	:)
2014-02-06 06:08:09	Cale	They're simultaneously defining the graph and names for its projections.
2014-02-06 06:08:15	NikolajK	I'd like them to write G=(V_G,E_G)
2014-02-06 06:08:20	tac	I would personally prefer G = (V, E)
2014-02-06 06:08:28	NikolajK	yeah, or that
2014-02-06 06:08:45	tac	But some people use silly notation
2014-02-06 06:08:47	Cale	G = (V,E) is okay, but then you don't have a convenient way later to refer to the vertices of a graph
2014-02-06 06:09:04	imprimable	with the source and target map ?
2014-02-06 06:09:05	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 06:09:07	Cale	You could write pi_1 G or something silly like that
2014-02-06 06:09:10	tac	Cale: That happens a lot in other subjects
2014-02-06 06:09:17	Cale	But why not just introduce the maps all at once?
2014-02-06 06:09:30	tac	If V(I) is a variety generated by an ideal I, you don't know the ambient space and you don't know the coordinate ring
2014-02-06 06:09:56	NikolajK	btw., I mentioned this on the haskell-blah channel too: (warning, I can be a formality freak when I write down clear notes): Doesn't it bother anyone when people write "a monoidal category is a pair (C,*), where..." this definition makes a monoidal cateogry to be not a category
2014-02-06 06:10:04	tac	You can think of V as a function taking implicit variables, or in the scope of an "opened module" if you're thinking like an Agda'er
2014-02-06 06:10:12	Cale	NikolajK: That's okay :)
2014-02-06 06:10:28	NikolajK	what exactly :)
2014-02-06 06:10:41	tac	NikolajK: The hard truth is most people do not care much about notation as long as they can still get their papers accepted.
2014-02-06 06:11:07	Cale	NikolajK: Every monoidal category will end up being a category too, but it's not its underlying category (though it is isomorphic to it)
2014-02-06 06:11:09	tac	There was a student in class today who use a_{i_{k_i}} in a presentation
2014-02-06 06:11:24	tac	and then objected when the teacher commented that was confusing
2014-02-06 06:11:32	NikolajK	yeah, I understand that perfectly in fact, it's just that when I make note and point out relations between mathematical objects formally, then it's tiresome
2014-02-06 06:11:33	tac	"Well that's just the way I'm doing it!"
2014-02-06 06:11:46	NikolajK	if the definitions are sub-good
2014-02-06 06:12:20	imprimable	its a lot of time to think about relevant notations
2014-02-06 06:12:52	Cale	NikolajK: Also, how you formalise things depends on the underlying formalism you want to use.
2014-02-06 06:12:59	NikolajK	Feynman has a paragraph in one of his autobiogaphies where he talks about how he invented his own notation for sin and cos in school and it was a mess
2014-02-06 06:13:03	NikolajK	to communicate
2014-02-06 06:13:11	Cale	The formalisation of monoidal categories will look a good bit different in ZFC than it does in HoTT for example.
2014-02-06 06:13:39	NikolajK	yeah true, I go mostly with set theory formalism - out of necessity
2014-02-06 06:13:57	NikolajK	I mean the literauture is written like that
2014-02-06 06:14:15	Cale	Informally, we don't really need to give a shit about those distinctions, because it's easy, even if tedious, to make things work regardless of which formalism you choose.
2014-02-06 06:14:36	Cale	But good notation is important
2014-02-06 06:15:12	imprimable	well sometimes even the word is important
2014-02-06 06:15:17	imprimable	it makes you "feel" the right concept directly
2014-02-06 06:15:19	Cale	So, being able to express that we have some category and what the monoidal operation on objects, identity object, and relevant isomorphisms are is more important than how you formally encode that data.
2014-02-06 06:15:42	NikolajK	imprimable: I agree
2014-02-06 06:15:51	NikolajK	and I'd even say it's dangerous
2014-02-06 06:15:51	tac	You don't want to write code :)
2014-02-06 06:16:07	tac	Code hides your intention
2014-02-06 06:16:07	NikolajK	some names suggest things which make you think in a wrong way
2014-02-06 06:16:10	Cale	Saying that it's a tuple just makes it easy to write out that data, and makes it clear the extent of what's required.
2014-02-06 06:16:18	imprimable	talking about names, how is ring looking like a ring ?
2014-02-06 06:16:18	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 06:16:19	tac	You find a good balance between accuracy and focus on what's important.
2014-02-06 06:16:50	NikolajK	there are threads on this on the internet
2014-02-06 06:16:59	NikolajK	(on ring etc.)
2014-02-06 06:17:27	tac	NikolajK: How do you feel about Einstein's notation :P
2014-02-06 06:17:27	NikolajK	notation is big topic for me, academic interest so to speak
2014-02-06 06:17:33	Cale	It might have had something to do that when the term was coined, the rings people were interested in were mostly rings of algebraic integers.
2014-02-06 06:17:34	NikolajK	tac: it's good
2014-02-06 06:17:40	tac	NikolajK: you're a horrible person
2014-02-06 06:17:44	 *	tac cries
2014-02-06 06:17:58	NikolajK	it's not ambigous, so what's the deal
2014-02-06 06:18:07	Cale	and you have cyclic things going on with the powers of an algebraic integer
2014-02-06 06:18:16	imprimable	ok, so "ring"
2014-02-06 06:18:23	imprimable	and fields ?
2014-02-06 06:18:24	imprimable	:>
2014-02-06 06:18:35	tac	How do you know when something is being summed over? Why is putting a ∑ in front so tedious?
2014-02-06 06:18:44	Cale	But also, "ring" is a word which is sometimes used for a collection of people
2014-02-06 06:18:47	NikolajK	fields are called Körper in german btw., and Körper literally means body
2014-02-06 06:18:54	imprimable	yes, as in french
2014-02-06 06:18:55	Cale	and we run out of names for collections with structure
2014-02-06 06:18:55	imprimable	"corps"
2014-02-06 06:19:07	Cale	so, we start needing to use weird ones :)
2014-02-06 06:19:16	NikolajK	(and the germans were doing this stuff back in 1870-, so fields is not the "real" name, so to speak)
2014-02-06 06:19:19	imprimable	magma is already a weird one
2014-02-06 06:19:36	NikolajK	Cale: haha
2014-02-06 06:19:47	NikolajK	Corps theory
2014-02-06 06:20:05	NikolajK	magma is a pokemon
2014-02-06 06:20:11	Cale	Look at set theory, the stuff they're doing is so ridiculous that they've started naming things like "beavers" and "iterable pre-mice" and "zero hand-grenade"
2014-02-06 06:20:58	imprimable	AHAH
2014-02-06 06:21:00	imprimable	zero hand grenade
2014-02-06 06:21:27	NikolajK	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachurin
2014-02-06 06:21:27	NikolajK	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog
2014-02-06 06:21:31	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-06 06:21:39	Cale	The zero hand-grenade thing is because there was, iirc, 0* and 0# (sharp) and then 0 dagger (the typographical symbol), and then people started to notice things were getting violent
2014-02-06 06:21:48	imprimable	ahah

2014-02-06 06:30:57	tac	Now the names are just dumb, and the HoTT guys spoiled everything and showed everything is variable binding and function application, removing most of the need for symbols

2014-02-06 06:52:31	Cale	But lots of people seem to have heard something about it and are interested.
2014-02-06 06:56:54	tac	That's because it's morally correct :)
2014-02-06 06:57:18	tac	Now if we could just figure out why equality is such a pain in the butt
2014-02-06 07:02:14	Cale	Well, because there are so many kinds of it

2014-02-06 07:04:09	Cale	I miss Gnome 2 so much sometimes
2014-02-06 07:06:13	Cale	tac: Well, if everyone knew when two things are equal, it would sort of trivialise most of mathematics.
2014-02-06 07:06:45	tac	hey Cale (or anyone), do you happen to know anything about presheaf models of type theory?
2014-02-06 07:06:56	Cale	I know almost nothing about them
2014-02-06 07:07:01	tac	hm
2014-02-06 07:07:21	Cale	I haven't gotten into the model/metatheoretical side of things yet
2014-02-06 07:07:32	tac	I feel like research is 30% figuring out how to phrase your questions. And that's my keyword for the week

2014-02-06 17:54:44	mr-	Hmm.. weird. Is the following true? G, F functors such that G . F is an equivalence, then G restricted to the essential image of F is an equivalence
2014-02-06 17:55:24	mr-	Is that even true for functions?
2014-02-06 18:22:11	Cale	Suppose g and f are functions such that g . f is a bijection. In particular g . f is injective, so for any f(x) and f(y) in the image of f, we have that g(f(x)) = g(f(y)) => (g.f)(x) = (g.f)(y) => x = y, so the restriction of g to the image of f is injective.
2014-02-06 18:24:50	Cale	Moreover, we know that for any y in the codomain of (g . f) (which is the codomain of g), we must have that there's some x in the domain of f such that y = (g . f)(x) = g(f(x)), so g applied to f(x) gives y, and hence g restricted to the image of f is surjective as well.

2014-02-07 03:35:50	imprimable	yes, i just had an answer from algrebaist @ math, thanks Cale
2014-02-07 03:36:05	imprimable	i was misled by the fact that the insertion of generators is never a morphism
2014-02-07 03:36:28	imprimable	but you can always take f(1) = (2042420) f(2) = (2042420*2042420) ...
2014-02-07 03:38:09	tomprince	That is a common trap to fall into, often the are some obvious morphisms or functions that exists, but those aren't necesarily the only ones, even if the way we talk about things seems to indicate they are.
2014-02-07 03:38:28	imprimable	yes ahah
2014-02-07 03:38:33	tomprince	Saying, the morpism M(|A|)->A, for example, when there are likey lots of them.
2014-02-07 03:38:55	tomprince	(For example, compose with any automorphism of |A|.
2014-02-07 03:40:49	Cale	Note that the natural numbers under addition are the same thing as M({1})
2014-02-07 03:41:08	Cale	(in that they're isomorphic as a monoid to that)
2014-02-07 03:41:23	imprimable	yes, thats what algebraist explained to me
2014-02-07 03:43:49	tomprince	(One thing when dealing with morphisms between free monoids, is that they don't have to send generators to generators)

2014-02-07 04:08:50	imprimable	what does it mean "the equivalence relation generated by f(x) = g(x)"
2014-02-07 04:09:50	imprimable	an equivalence relation is a subset of a cartesian product of some sets in Sets, such that it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
2014-02-07 04:09:56	imprimable	what's the cartesian product here
2014-02-07 04:10:56	imprimable	this part is really badly written in Awodey
2014-02-07 04:15:30	tac	imprimable: for what? A pushout?
2014-02-07 04:15:43	imprimable	no, a coequilizer

2014-02-07 04:16:15	tac	It means that if f, g : X -> Y
2014-02-07 04:16:50	tac	You can think of the coequalizer as the set Y quotiented such that y = y'    if there exists an x in X such taht f(x) = y and g(x) = y'
2014-02-07 04:17:13	tac	So, for all x in X, f(x) ~ g(x) is your equiv relation
2014-02-07 04:18:22	imprimable	so you're identifying the couple of elements from X to Y
2014-02-07 04:18:43	tac	You are identifying elements in Y
2014-02-07 04:18:47	tac	~ is an equiv relation on Y
2014-02-07 04:18:58	tac	So Y/~ is the coequalizer
2014-02-07 04:18:59	imprimable	yes its the couple (f(x), g(x)) right ?
2014-02-07 04:19:20	imprimable	so you have as many equivalent class as couple
2014-02-07 04:19:22	imprimable	or i idn't get it
2014-02-07 04:19:33	tac	When you said "couple" do you mean an ordered pair?
2014-02-07 04:19:37	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:19:38	tac	(I have never heard it called a couple before)
2014-02-07 04:19:39	imprimable	ordered pair sorry
2014-02-07 04:19:43	imprimable	(french word)
2014-02-07 04:19:46	tac	You know what an equivalence relation is, right?
2014-02-07 04:19:50	imprimable	sure i do
2014-02-07 04:19:56	tac	yeah
2014-02-07 04:20:03	tac	so then your equivalence relation is a set of couples :)
2014-02-07 04:20:19	imprimable	no, i mean
2014-02-07 04:20:31	imprimable	the equivalent classes are all of card 1
2014-02-07 04:20:37	imprimable	one couple = one equivalent class
2014-02-07 04:20:42	imprimable	or i didn't understand what you wrote
2014-02-07 04:20:54	tac	Maybe you should try working out an example
2014-02-07 04:20:58	tac	How about this one
2014-02-07 04:21:00	tac	Z -> Z
2014-02-07 04:21:05	tac	with f(x) = x
2014-02-07 04:21:07	tac	and g(x) = -x
2014-02-07 04:21:27	tac	What is the coequalizer?
2014-02-07 04:21:41	imprimable	i don't understand the definition with quotient
2014-02-07 04:21:51	imprimable	i could give it easily otherwise
2014-02-07 04:21:55	imprimable	but i want to understand what you said
2014-02-07 04:22:04	imprimable	here you have to identify y and -y
2014-02-07 04:22:11	tac	yeah
2014-02-07 04:22:19	imprimable	still, it doesn't help me
2014-02-07 04:22:22	imprimable	what do you mean by
2014-02-07 04:22:28	imprimable	 set Y quotiented such that y = y'    if there exists an x in X such taht f(x) = y and g(x) = y'
2014-02-07 04:22:39	imprimable	your equivalent relation is for a given y,y' ?
2014-02-07 04:22:53	tac	Look at the example
2014-02-07 04:23:00	tac	your coequalizer will be the set Z / ~
2014-02-07 04:23:05	tac	Where I defined ~ above
2014-02-07 04:23:07	imprimable	yes it will be N
2014-02-07 04:23:11	tac	So 1 ~ -1
2014-02-07 04:23:12	imprimable	you just quotient by Z/2
2014-02-07 04:23:16	imprimable	Z2
2014-02-07 04:23:23	tac	I wouldn't write it like that, but yeah
2014-02-07 04:23:30	imprimable	but i don't understand what you say
2014-02-07 04:23:33	imprimable	i don't want an example sorry
2014-02-07 04:23:36	tac	So your elements are things like {1, -1} and {0}, and {2, -2}
2014-02-07 04:23:48	imprimable	ok so y and y' are given
2014-02-07 04:23:57	imprimable	you "chose" them
2014-02-07 04:23:59	imprimable	and then you identify
2014-02-07 04:24:04	imprimable	they don't "vary"

2014-02-07 04:24:33	tac	You have, for every x in X, f(x) ~ g(x)
2014-02-07 04:24:46	tac	Then you add in whatever else is missing to make it an equivalence relation
2014-02-07 04:25:13	imprimable	i don't understand omg
2014-02-07 04:25:27	tac	So for each y, y',y'' in Y, you also have y ~ y     and y ~ y' => y' ~ y         and y ~ y' ^ y' ~ y'' => y ~ y''

2014-02-07 04:26:11	imprimable	ok so
2014-02-07 04:26:23	imprimable	you have to find the equivalent relation SUCH THAT y ~ y'
2014-02-07 04:26:43	imprimable	you force y ~ y' but you don't have any "universal form" for it
2014-02-07 04:27:22	imprimable	so basically you're identifying all the ordered pair, then you add trantivity, and symmetry
2014-02-07 04:27:27	imprimable	thats it ?
2014-02-07 04:27:34	tac	and reflexivity, but yes.
2014-02-07 04:27:37	imprimable	yes

2014-02-07 04:27:55	tac	You know exactly what it is, given f and g.
2014-02-07 04:28:03	imprimable	well, you have to construct it yes
2014-02-07 04:28:05	imprimable	i understand
2014-02-07 04:28:10	imprimable	ok
2014-02-07 04:28:15	tac	if you have f and g, you can define ~ based on them
2014-02-07 04:28:19	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:28:21	imprimable	i understand
2014-02-07 04:28:42	imprimable	i was trying to show that f(x) ~ g(x) was an explicit equialence relation
2014-02-07 04:28:44	imprimable	but actually
2014-02-07 04:28:46	imprimable	it is ~
2014-02-07 04:28:53	imprimable	f(x) = g(x) sorry
2014-02-07 04:28:54	imprimable	i got it
2014-02-07 04:29:12	imprimable	you have to write it f(x) ~ g(x) then the equivalence relation your quotienting with is precisely ~
2014-02-07 04:30:11	imprimable	so yes, you're equalizing by force
2014-02-07 04:30:18	imprimable	is it always possibl to construct such equivalent relation ?
2014-02-07 04:30:35	imprimable	ie, does the coequilizer always exists ?
2014-02-07 04:30:44	tac	So, the definition we have here is defined in the category of sets
2014-02-07 04:30:48	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:31:05	tac	And so we've shown that sets has all coequalizers for any possible X, Y, f, and g
2014-02-07 04:31:10	tac	Other categories may or may not have them
2014-02-07 04:31:20	tac	And they might be constructed differently
2014-02-07 04:31:32	imprimable	how can you show that f(x) ~ g(x) always have a solution
2014-02-07 04:31:44	tac	Because you constructed it.

2014-02-07 04:34:09	imprimable	hm
2014-02-07 04:34:17	tac	But as long as Y is nonempty, y in Y implies y ~ y
2014-02-07 04:34:23	imprimable	quotienting by empty relation means keeping the same set ?
2014-02-07 04:34:42	tac	Well, the only time the empty relation is an equivalence relation is when the original set is empty
2014-02-07 04:34:55	tac	Reflexivity adds y ~ y for every y in Y
2014-02-07 04:35:01	imprimable	ah, true

2014-02-07 04:37:39	tac	That's the idea if you "glue" some elements of X together
2014-02-07 04:37:40	imprimable	i understand
2014-02-07 04:37:43	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:37:46	tac	[x] = [x'] iff x ~ x'
2014-02-07 04:37:57	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:38:08	imprimable	so if you take two maps f and g such that f is never equal to g
2014-02-07 04:38:14	imprimable	you ahve as many equivalent classes as element of X
2014-02-07 04:38:15	imprimable	thats it
2014-02-07 04:38:42	tac	I think you have to have it where f is never unequal to g
2014-02-07 04:38:51	imprimable	hm, why ?
2014-02-07 04:39:24	tac	if f(x) = g(x) for all x, well... you get f(x) ~ g(x)... but since f(x) = g(x), that's really saying you get f(x) ~ f(x) which you have already because of reflexivity
2014-02-07 04:40:10	imprimable	ok with symmetry
2014-02-07 04:40:19	imprimable	you need more condition than just "never equal"
2014-02-07 04:40:31	imprimable	transitivity is hard to see
2014-02-07 04:43:50	imprimable	but its really not "well defined" imo
2014-02-07 04:43:54	imprimable	to say f(x) ~ g(x)
2014-02-07 04:44:16	imprimable	because you don't satisfy reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity a priori when you see it like that
2014-02-07 04:44:46	tac	You don't check the laws until you're done defining the thing
2014-02-07 04:45:02	tac	The set is anything you can build from those four rules I listed
2014-02-07 04:45:21	tac	And the last three guarantee whatever you end up with will be an equivalence relation
2014-02-07 04:46:08	imprimable	so basically, your set if (y,y') such that there exist a x such that f(x) = g(x)
2014-02-07 04:46:21	imprimable	your set is {(y,y') such that ...}
2014-02-07 04:46:36	imprimable	then, you add reflexivity
2014-02-07 04:46:40	imprimable	transitivity
2014-02-07 04:46:46	imprimable	and symmetry
2014-02-07 04:46:51	tac	yeah
2014-02-07 04:46:55	imprimable	ok
2014-02-07 04:47:04	imprimable	can you write such set with maps ?
2014-02-07 04:47:10	imprimable	symmetry is the diagonal map
2014-02-07 04:47:12	imprimable	erm
2014-02-07 04:47:14	imprimable	reflexivity
2014-02-07 04:47:15	imprimable	sorry
2014-02-07 04:47:15	tac	In other words, you define the "smallest" equivalence relation that satisfies f(x) ~ g(x) for all x
2014-02-07 04:47:17	imprimable	symmetry is the swap
2014-02-07 04:47:21	imprimable	yes
2014-02-07 04:47:22	tac	yes
2014-02-07 04:47:26	imprimable	how can you define transitivity
2014-02-07 04:47:32	imprimable	associativity ?
2014-02-07 04:48:37	imprimable	because if U C YxY and is such that U = {(y,y') such that there exist a x in X, f(x) = y(x)}
2014-02-07 04:49:13	imprimable	then your equivalent relation is diag(U) union swap(U) union ...
2014-02-07 04:49:48	imprimable	how can you define reflexivity as maps ?
2014-02-07 04:49:51	imprimable	let me check
2014-02-07 04:51:43	imprimable	i don't know
2014-02-07 04:52:33	imprimable	anyone knows ?
2014-02-07 04:53:13	imprimable	thx tac anyway
2014-02-07 04:53:21	imprimable	but really, i think awodey is a bit fast sometimes
2014-02-07 04:53:24	imprimable	3 lines to understand that
2014-02-07 04:53:27	imprimable	is maybe too short

2014-02-07 04:53:28	tac	thanks anyway? I spent like an hour explaining this :/
2014-02-07 04:53:35	imprimable	ahah

2014-02-07 04:54:08	imprimable	well
2014-02-07 04:54:15	imprimable	i couldn't make sense of f(x) = g(x)
2014-02-07 04:54:20	imprimable	it was written this way
2014-02-07 04:54:23	tac	Awodey's book isn't the easiest to read, but I guarantee, all of the answers are either there or are in your introduction to set theory book
2014-02-07 04:56:38	imprimable	well i don't know, for example my question yesterday
2014-02-07 04:56:53	imprimable	without knowing that every monoid could be written as a quotient of its free monoid by some relations

2014-02-07 13:25:23	tac	aww
2014-02-07 13:25:46	Cale	tac: However, there's an obvious formulation of the laws they need to satisfy
2014-02-07 13:25:59	tac	Oh yeah?
2014-02-07 13:26:04	tac	What laws are those?
2014-02-07 13:27:09	Cale	Well, okay, in Haskell, you'll want to insist that they always give a monad when given a monad, but I wouldn't bother trying to formulate type constructors categorically just for that, and rather focus on what lift has to do
2014-02-07 13:27:28	Cale	(actually, it's quite possible now that I think about it that this actually is well-studied)
2014-02-07 13:27:49	Cale	anyway, so, the properties that lift should have are basically that it should commute with the operations of the monad
2014-02-07 13:28:02	Cale	lift (return v) = return v

2014-02-07 13:29:02	tac	yeah, I think I saw those in the MonadTrans docs just now
2014-02-07 13:29:17	Cale	and  lift . join = join . lift . fmap lift
2014-02-07 13:30:04	Cale	That's sort of the natural thing for a morphism between monads to be
2014-02-07 13:30:42	Cale	Given monads M and N on C, a monad homomorphism ought to be a natural transformation alpha: M -> N
2014-02-07 13:31:36	Cale	such that, well, we have eta : 1 -> M, and eta' : 1 -> N, and so alpha should give a commutative triangle

2014-02-07 13:32:35	Cale	and we can fit alpha * alpha on one side and alpha on the other and that becomes a square which is sort of the natural thing which we ought to insist should commute
2014-02-07 13:33:54	tac	You mentioned monad morphisms. Are those related to monad transformers somehow?
2014-02-07 13:34:13	Cale	Yes
2014-02-07 13:34:23	Cale	lift is supposed to be a homomorphism of monads
2014-02-07 13:34:31	tac	ahhh
2014-02-07 13:34:32	tac	yeah
2014-02-07 13:34:32	tac	ok
2014-02-07 13:35:08	tac	So a monad transformer should be... some kind of natural family of monad homs

2014-02-07 13:36:52	Cale	It's amazing how sometimes what's natural to consider in functional programming you wouldn't usually think to consider from a category theoretical perspective :)
2014-02-07 13:37:54	Cale	oh, hmm
2014-02-07 13:38:03	Cale	Is it an endofunctor on the category of monads?
2014-02-07 13:38:26	Cale	well, no
2014-02-07 13:38:26	tac	it takes every monad to another monad, sure
2014-02-07 13:38:28	Cale	it's not
2014-02-07 13:38:51	Cale	It doesn't take every natural transformation M -> N to a map T M -> T N in general
2014-02-07 13:39:30	Cale	(or do all our examples actually do that?)
2014-02-07 13:39:55	tac	It sounds like a very categorical definition
2014-02-07 13:40:03	tac	If it's not monad transformers, I'm sure it's important :)
2014-02-07 13:40:14	Cale	Oh, well, sure :)
2014-02-07 13:40:40	tac	Come summer time, I'm going to be leaving my job
2014-02-07 13:40:56	tac	So I'm trying to figure out what to do during my "sabbatical"
2014-02-07 13:41:14	tac	I'd like to do some sort of independent research related to dependent types
2014-02-07 13:41:49	Cale	I've just been greedily soaking up everything I can find on HoTT :)
2014-02-07 13:42:00	tac	Yeah.
2014-02-07 13:42:24	Cale	Not much in the way of actual contributions yet though, apart from helping introduce others
2014-02-07 13:42:25	tac	I'd love to write some crappy deptyped language that implements "practice" univalence.
2014-02-07 13:42:32	tac	yeah
2014-02-07 13:42:44	tac	Have you looked at the cubical sets paper/implementation at all?
2014-02-07 13:42:58	Cale	Mike Shulman's already done all the easy things ;)
2014-02-07 13:43:05	Cale	I haven't really looked too closely
2014-02-07 13:43:17	tac	heh
2014-02-07 13:43:19	Cale	I did skim it enough to see that it wasn't going to be trivial to understand
2014-02-07 13:44:21	tac	I've been taking a crack at it. I almost sort of see the setup for it.
2014-02-07 13:44:38	copumpkin	Cale: have you made it down to NYC yet?
2014-02-07 13:44:42	tac	The implementation looks like they are trying to do a few things at once, though. It's a small language, but not "minimal"
2014-02-07 13:45:31	Cale	copumpkin: no, not yet
2014-02-07 13:45:38	copumpkin	:O
2014-02-07 13:46:04	Cale	copumpkin: I'm talking to Edward about what I should do. Giving him a chance to hire me :)
2014-02-07 13:46:18	copumpkin	:O
2014-02-07 13:46:23	copumpkin	so Boston instead of NYC?
2014-02-07 13:46:27	Cale	He's looking into that and he also has some other options for what I should do
2014-02-07 13:46:48	Cale	So, depending on what goes on, Boston, NYC, Oregon or Singapore are possible
2014-02-07 13:47:24	Cale	I'm not in a *big* rush to move though, since I have a bunch of money from working at skedge.me and my expenses are quite low here.
2014-02-07 13:47:50	copumpkin	fair enough :)
2014-02-07 13:47:53	copumpkin	Singapore but not London? :O
2014-02-07 13:58:56	Cale	I dunno!
2014-02-07 13:59:05	Cale	I'm just repeating what Ed told me
2014-02-07 13:59:38	Cale	I'm not sure I really consider Singapore a real option, but we'll see
2014-02-07 13:59:54	Cale	If Oregon, then at least I have extended family there

2014-02-10 23:43:58	watermind	so we're left with the reminder condition which is that of the coproduct
2014-02-10 23:44:00	watermind	eh
2014-02-10 23:44:17	watermind	mr-: thanks and sorry, I was got really confused for a moment
2014-02-10 23:44:30	watermind	it's clear now

2014-02-11 01:11:32	imprimable	hi
2014-02-11 01:11:40	tac	hi
2014-02-11 01:11:48	imprimable	why is a morphism in the category of subobject not a mono ?
2014-02-11 01:12:30	imprimable	if m : M->X and m': M' -> X are two subojects of X
2014-02-11 01:12:52	imprimable	i would expect that an arrow from m to m' is a mono f: M -> M'
2014-02-11 01:13:03	imprimable	why don't we require it to be a mono
2014-02-11 01:13:39	tomprince	Maybe it has to be?
2014-02-11 01:13:46	imprimable	hm, not in awodey
2014-02-11 01:13:50	imprimable	ok
2014-02-11 01:13:53	imprimable	let me demonstrat it has to be
2014-02-11 01:14:01	imprimable	f is unique because m' is a mono
2014-02-11 01:14:12	imprimable	now lets show that it is a mono itself
2014-02-11 01:14:36	imprimable	let g, h, from N to M
2014-02-11 01:14:59	imprimable	ah
2014-02-11 01:15:00	imprimable	ok
2014-02-11 01:15:01	imprimable	it is
2014-02-11 01:15:04	imprimable	because maps are unique
2014-02-11 01:15:05	imprimable	thx tomprince
2014-02-11 01:15:17	imprimable	got it
2014-02-11 01:16:21	imprimable	so it means M is a suboject of M' inside Sub_C(X)
2014-02-11 01:16:26	imprimable	i mean, f
2014-02-11 01:16:34	tomprince	It is actually a general result that if g.f is mono, then f is mono.

2014-02-11 01:17:32	imprimable	and if g°f is epic, g is epic
2014-02-11 01:17:43	imprimable	wait
2014-02-11 01:17:44	imprimable	is that true
2014-02-11 01:17:55	imprimable	isnt it if g°f is epic, f is epic ?
2014-02-11 01:18:06	imprimable	and g°f i mono, g is mono ?
2014-02-11 01:19:04	tomprince	Consider  {1,2} -> {1,2,3} -> {1,2} (given by 1|->1, 2|->2, 3|->2).
2014-02-11 01:19:24	tomprince	The entire thing is iso (so mono+epic), the first is mono and the second epic.
2014-02-11 01:19:43	tomprince	Remember that composition is written backwards.
2014-02-11 01:19:50	imprimable	yes
2014-02-11 01:20:00	imprimable	omg
2014-02-11 01:20:03	imprimable	i'm retarded
2014-02-11 01:20:07	imprimable	g°f is epic means f is epic
2014-02-11 01:20:11	imprimable	obviously
2014-02-11 01:20:15	imprimable	if you think about surjectivity
2014-02-11 01:20:19	imprimable	(evn if its not the same i know)
2014-02-11 01:21:16	tomprince	You mean, g is epic.
2014-02-11 01:21:23	imprimable	but why don't we impose that f be monic in the ambiant category of X ?
2014-02-11 01:22:18	tomprince	We don't impose it, because it is automatically true.
2014-02-11 01:22:37	tomprince	If we did impose it, people might wonder about morphisms that weren't mono.
2014-02-11 01:23:04	imprimable	i mean, the category C in which X and M are objects
2014-02-11 01:23:14	imprimable	not teh category Sub_C(X)
2014-02-11 01:24:38	tomprince	I know.
2014-02-11 01:24:48	imprimable	oh so its true too
2014-02-11 01:25:20	imprimable	how can you show that ?
2014-02-11 01:25:45	tomprince	If f: (m, M) -> (m', M) is a morphism in Sub(X), (where m: M -> X and m' : M' -> X)
2014-02-11 01:26:10	tomprince	Then you have a diagram m' . f = m (and m is monic)
2014-02-11 01:26:33	tomprince	... so f must also be monic.
2014-02-11 01:26:44	imprimable	in Sub(X) yes
2014-02-11 01:26:54	imprimable	in C, not necessarily
2014-02-11 01:26:56	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-11 01:27:04	tomprince	The diagram  m' . f = m is in C.
2014-02-11 01:27:34	imprimable	true
2014-02-11 01:27:39	imprimable	so it holds for all other arrows
2014-02-11 01:27:41	imprimable	ok
2014-02-11 01:27:43	imprimable	i understand
2014-02-11 01:27:43	imprimable	thx
2014-02-11 01:28:05	imprimable	i though that "being monic" or "being epic" was much more dependant on the ambiant category
2014-02-11 01:28:43	tomprince	It does depend on the ambivent category.
2014-02-11 01:29:37	tomprince	Consider g.f monic, we want to show that f is monic.
2014-02-11 01:30:03	tomprince	Given h,h' such that f.h = f.h'.
2014-02-11 01:30:20	tomprince	We know that g.f.h = g.f.h'.
2014-02-11 01:30:33	tomprince	Since g.f is monic, we know that h = h'.
2014-02-11 01:30:39	tomprince	Thus, f is monic.
2014-02-11 01:30:40	imprimable	therefore, f is monic
2014-02-11 01:30:42	imprimable	yes

2014-02-11 05:08:37	tac	the universal "in-tos" are limits and universal "out-ofs" are colimits
2014-02-11 05:08:50	imprimable	yes, i see
2014-02-11 05:10:34	Cale	For sets or topological spaces, the pushout of A and B along some maps f: C -> A and g: C -> B is the disjoint union of A and B modulo an equivalence relation which for each x in C, identifies f(x) with g(x).
2014-02-11 05:11:25	tac	and things are especially nice if the maps are injections
2014-02-11 05:11:53	tac	Iirc, if they are both injections, you can simply treat both spaces A and B as having a common subspace C
2014-02-11 05:11:59	Cale	Just as the pullback of A and B along some maps f: A -> C and g: B -> C consists of the subset of the Cartesian product consisting of (x,y) for which f(x) = g(y)
2014-02-11 05:12:26	Cale	yeah
2014-02-11 05:12:58	imprimable	yes
2014-02-11 05:13:01	tac	Simple example, C = [-1, 1] is the closed interval in the real line
2014-02-11 05:13:02	imprimable	its really beautiful
2014-02-11 05:13:13	tac	A would be (-inf, 1] and B would be [-1, +inf)
2014-02-11 05:13:33	tac	I beleive the mapping cylinder is easy to define with a pushout as well
2014-02-11 05:13:44	Cale	Pushouts of topological spaces appear in the Brown-Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which says that they're preserved by the fundamental groupoid construction. i.e. the fundamental groupoid of the pushout of topological spaces is the pushout of fundamental groupoids.
2014-02-11 05:15:21	Cale	(and then you can get a corollary of that about fundamental groups of pointed spaces)
2014-02-11 05:17:28	Cale	That's a primary tool in computing fundamental groups. For instance, you can construct the circle as a pushout of two intervals along the map which takes the two-point space to the endpoints of the interval.

2014-02-12 14:10:50	cads	Is it hard to build a category where objects are languages/machines and morphisms are compilers from one language to another ?
2014-02-12 14:11:57	cads	or perhaps a toy model where we can pretend that is what is going on?
2014-02-12 14:13:52	cads	maybe you could build a lawvere theory complex enough to represent an actual programming language?
2014-02-12 14:14:58	cads	I'm not sure what the appropriate notation of compilation/interpretation is, for lawvere theories
2014-02-12 14:17:01	Cale	cads: Well, it's easy to imagine such a thing as a category...
2014-02-12 14:17:46	Cale	The hard part is how much additional structure you'd like to reflect, since noticing that it's a category doesn't on its own get you very far.
2014-02-12 14:18:51	cads	right, we'd like a category plus... a pretty printer for the programs
2014-02-12 14:21:09	cads	seems like there's no end to different details and constructions we could throw in the mix
2014-02-12 14:21:09	tomprince	Do the compiler need to preserve semantics (and if so, how are they defined)
2014-02-12 14:21:52	tomprince	Or is a semantics simply a slice category?
2014-02-12 14:23:17	cads	yeah maybe the induced functor just has to be sufficiently nice to the slice category
2014-02-12 14:23:29	cads	faithful?
2014-02-12 14:24:01	tomprince	No, a slice category *is* a semantics.
2014-02-12 14:24:17	tomprince	So that some particular language defines what a program does.
2014-02-12 14:24:35	tomprince	And a semantics for a given langauge is a morphism to the chosen langauge.
2014-02-12 14:24:54	tomprince	Then semantic preserving compilers are morphisms compatible with choice of semantics for each language.
2014-02-12 14:26:08	cads	What objects are we taking slice categories over?
2014-02-12 14:27:45	tomprince	The full subcategory of sets where the objects are languages (and the elements are programs in that language).
2014-02-12 14:30:18	cads	I figured languages could be objects in some category, and then the generalized elements in the slice category over a language A might serve to encode the programs and the semantics at the same time.
2014-02-12 14:32:50	cads	so you're saying a language is an object A with programs as elements, and then a semantics for a language is a morphism f: A -> B  interpreting A in B.
2014-02-12 14:33:34	tomprince	I'm positing that, yes.
2014-02-12 14:33:48	tomprince	That probably isn't the only construction.
2014-02-12 14:34:29	cads	lol, I've no fear there :)
2014-02-12 14:36:03	cads	so our compilers are just morphisms in the arrow category of out category of languages
2014-02-12 14:36:38	tomprince	compilers are just morphisms in our category of langages.
2014-02-12 14:37:51	cads	but we also need a way to make sure that a compiler c : A -> B is honest relative to the chosen semantics  a : A -> A' and  b: B -> B'.
2014-02-12 14:39:47	cads	Thus a compiler of type   (A, a) -> (B, b)  might also need an arrow  f' : A' -> B' so that things commute.
2014-02-12 14:40:53	cads	which seems troublesome
2014-02-12 14:41:21	cads	in the case where A' = B' it seems reasonable to take f' = id
2014-02-12 14:42:48	tomprince	I was assuming that A' = B' and f' = id, yes. (Hence the slice category over the semantic languge L.
2014-02-12 14:43:25	tomprince	To compare semantics, you would just look at a compiler from one semantics to the other.
2014-02-12 14:43:43	tomprince	s/semantics/semantic languages/
2014-02-12 14:44:52	cads	For example we want our haskell program to evaluate to the same semantics (output, say) regardless if we're evaluating it with pen and pencil, or evaluating in a cpu. We want not only related output, but completely identical output
2014-02-12 14:45:33	cads	tomprince: right, that makes sense
2014-02-12 14:48:35	cads	ah, the arrow category allows us to talk about both compilers and transformations between semantics
2014-02-12 14:51:35	cads	ie, let A = B and f = id, then f' is a translation between two semantical languages for A.
2014-02-12 14:53:13	cads	And in general the arrows of the arrow category can combine compilation and semantic shift, which seems natural

2014-02-12 14:56:14	cads	tomprince: For example, the compiler really takes our haskell code, along with our pretty printed pencil and paper evaluations of how it works, which serves as semantics A' for our language, suitable for working with, and translates the code to machine code, which has a natural semantics implemented by the CPU, which is quite different than the toy semantics we used to reason about the problem.

2014-02-12 14:58:10	tomprince	Maybe this is a case where you want to look at the twisted arrow category.
2014-02-12 14:58:44	tomprince	Since you probably want to analyze the CPU semantics in terms of the pencil semantics (not the other way around).
2014-02-12 14:59:48	cads	hmm
2014-02-12 15:05:22	cads	objects of the twisted arrow category will be the same semantically grounded languages
2014-02-12 15:10:11	cads	but now an arrow is a translation  f : A' -> B from the first language's semantics directly into the second language, along with a translation f': A -> B' that short circuits the path A->A'->B->B' we've built via f.
2014-02-12 15:12:08	cads	So to interpret our informal semantics we first encode them as entities in machine code. The machine code's CPU semantics now subsumes everything.
2014-02-12 15:13:00	cads	so we don't have to determine a way to translate our pen an paper semantics to machine code, thankfully
2014-02-12 15:15:24	cads	hmm, I'm not thinking of the right thing

2014-02-12 22:50:12	imprimable	hi
2014-02-12 22:50:33	imprimable	let C be a category with pullbacks and a terminal object 1
2014-02-12 22:50:49	imprimable	why is that obvious that Ax_1B =~ AxB ?
2014-02-12 22:51:12	mr-	Because both share the same universal property
2014-02-12 22:51:31	imprimable	but to show that
2014-02-12 22:51:39	imprimable	i need to "remove" the maps from A->1 and B-> 1
2014-02-12 22:51:41	imprimable	on the diagram
2014-02-12 22:51:52	imprimable	ie, they need to be monic right ?
2014-02-12 22:52:04	mr-	Why? There is no information in those maps, because 1 is terminal
2014-02-12 22:52:21	imprimable	how can i prove that there is no information, even if i understand why
2014-02-12 22:52:30	imprimable	there is a unique map
2014-02-12 22:52:31	imprimable	ok
2014-02-12 22:52:34	imprimable	because its unique
2014-02-12 22:52:54	imprimable	if h°f = h°g, because h is unique, f = g
2014-02-12 22:53:01	imprimable	no
2014-02-12 22:53:02	imprimable	:<
2014-02-12 22:53:11	imprimable	i say shit
2014-02-12 22:53:23	mr-	What is a map T -> Ax_1B ?
2014-02-12 22:54:07	imprimable	because of universal property
2014-02-12 22:54:15	imprimable	it is a map of the form <q_1,q_2>
2014-02-12 22:54:18	imprimable	so its the same as two maps
2014-02-12 22:54:22	imprimable	from T to A and T to B
2014-02-12 22:54:22	mr-	Exactly, it is a map T -> A and a map T -> B such that .... commutes.
2014-02-12 22:54:32	mr-	but .... commutes automatically, because all the maps go to 1 !
2014-02-12 22:54:45	imprimable	oh
2014-02-12 22:54:48	imprimable	so it holds for every maps
2014-02-12 22:54:51	imprimable	so i can "remove" the 1 object
2014-02-12 22:54:51	imprimable	i see
2014-02-12 22:55:21	mr-	Right, so a map into the pullback is _the same_ as two maps. Hence it is the product
2014-02-12 22:55:29	imprimable	yes
2014-02-12 22:55:46	imprimable	you have ot interprete them as "generalized element"

2014-02-12 22:59:01	imprimable	as a map from 1 to A is an "element" of A
2014-02-12 22:59:29	imprimable	so the arrows with codomain A
2014-02-12 22:59:34	imprimable	are the "generalized elements" of A

2014-02-12 23:01:11	imprimable	yes
2014-02-12 23:01:16	imprimable	because a pullbakc is also an equalizer
2014-02-12 23:01:21	imprimable	thats how i understand it more than a "product"

2014-02-12 23:06:36	imprimable	thats how i understand it
2014-02-12 23:10:48	imprimable	so if you have pullbacks and all products, you have equalizer

2014-02-12 23:12:47	imprimable	why do we need a terminal objects to have all products
2014-02-12 23:12:52	imprimable	this looks really "strong"
2014-02-12 23:13:06	mr-	because the terminal object is the empty product
2014-02-12 23:13:11	imprimable	i understand why all products => terminal object (empty product)
2014-02-12 23:13:15	imprimable	yes
2014-02-12 23:13:27	imprimable	but why does pullback + terminal => all products
2014-02-12 23:13:30	imprimable	why do i need a terminal here
2014-02-12 23:13:36	imprimable	it looks sufficient
2014-02-12 23:13:38	imprimable	but necessary
2014-02-12 23:13:42	imprimable	i don't feel so
2014-02-12 23:13:42	mr-	Ah, that's a different question.
2014-02-12 23:14:23	mr-	How do you get infinite products from pullbacks and a terminal object?
2014-02-12 23:14:57	imprimable	you keeps applying the pullback on the resulting products with a terminal object
2014-02-12 23:15:00	imprimable	it will always works
2014-02-12 23:15:09	mr-	Yes, that gives you all finite ones
2014-02-12 23:15:12	imprimable	yes
2014-02-12 23:15:22	mr-	and the infinite ones?
2014-02-12 23:15:25	imprimable	hm
2014-02-12 23:15:29	imprimable	i don't know
2014-02-12 23:15:47	imprimable	ah
2014-02-12 23:15:53	imprimable	you need an "infinite diagram pullback"
2014-02-12 23:15:56	imprimable	with a terminal object
2014-02-12 23:15:58	imprimable	thats why
2014-02-12 23:16:07	imprimable	the terminal object is here to have the infinite products
2014-02-12 23:16:08	imprimable	i see
2014-02-12 23:16:13	imprimable	otherwise you can't construct them
2014-02-12 23:16:14	imprimable	thx
2014-02-12 23:16:18	mr-	what is an infinite diagram pullback? ;-)
2014-02-12 23:16:34	imprimable	aha, i'm a ocnstructivist, so i would "disagree" that it exists
2014-02-12 23:16:38	imprimable	but SUPPOSING I AM NOT
2014-02-12 23:16:44	imprimable	it is just a set of objects (A_i)i in I

2014-02-12 23:36:04	Saizan	mr-: and i'm surprised that i can bring an equalizer f . e = g . e in C into an equalizer F f . F e = F g . F e into basically the kleisli category of F
2014-02-12 23:37:58	Saizan	but i guess the monad-ness of the thing helps
2014-02-12 23:38:43	imprimable	i have a question about diagram of type J
2014-02-12 23:38:51	imprimable	does the functor has to be "injective" ?
2014-02-12 23:39:06	imprimable	how can you say that a functor is injective for non small category
2014-02-12 23:39:57	Saizan	no, i don't think it has to be injective
2014-02-12 23:40:41	imprimable	ah
2014-02-12 23:40:44	imprimable	then its a bad definition
2014-02-12 23:40:48	imprimable	you can "collapse" the diagram
2014-02-12 23:41:37	imprimable	i guess the vocabulary is not well chosen
2014-02-12 23:44:58	mr-	imprimable: dunno.. A = A = A still is a pullback diagram ;-)
2014-02-12 23:45:05	mr-	even though it has been collapsed
2014-02-12 23:46:15	mr-	imprimable: also, non-trivial maps between the same objects lead to good diagrams, even though the functor was not "injective"
2014-02-12 23:46:34	imprimable	ok
2014-02-12 23:46:53	imprimable	so its like a "representation of diagram in C"

2014-02-12 23:47:17	mr-	F: J -> C is a diagram of shape J in C. That's how I think about it

2014-02-12 23:50:57	imprimable	i wonder who though about it

2014-02-13 00:22:49	imprimable	so there's "nothing more" to be understood in how objects are related in a category
2014-02-13 00:22:55	imprimable	once you understand limit and colimits
2014-02-13 00:23:05	imprimable	for elementary operations
2014-02-13 00:23:16	imprimable	you have to look for functors then
2014-02-13 00:24:06	imprimable	ok so thats why
2014-02-13 00:24:07	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 00:24:09	imprimable	thats exactly why

2014-02-13 00:24:23	imprimable	if your category has all product and equalizers, it has all limits
2014-02-13 00:24:31	imprimable	because products and equalizers are the "elementary operations"
2014-02-13 00:24:40	mr-	and the other way round, of course
2014-02-13 00:24:57	imprimable	yes, i'm trying to understand if its "powerful" to claim "a category has all limits"
2014-02-13 00:25:01	imprimable	actually its just as powerful as
2014-02-13 00:25:06	imprimable	"it has all products and equalizers"
2014-02-13 00:25:53	imprimable	because limits looks much more complicated and complex "at first"
2014-02-13 00:25:54	imprimable	actually they are not
2014-02-13 00:26:03	tac	Having all limits is a pretty pedestrian feature
2014-02-13 00:26:09	tac	and colimits*
2014-02-13 00:26:36	tac	Sets, Groups, Rings, Abelian Groups, Topological spaces, for instance, all have it
2014-02-13 00:26:41	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 00:26:47	imprimable	because they have all products and equalizers
2014-02-13 00:26:54	tac	Yes
2014-02-13 00:27:02	tac	Also, you need to be slightly careful when someone says "all limits"
2014-02-13 00:27:03	imprimable	so its "not that powerful" in some sense

2014-02-13 00:27:10	imprimable	yes, i should say finite ?
2014-02-13 00:27:11	tac	it sometimes means finite limits or countable limits
2014-02-13 00:27:14	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 00:27:17	imprimable	you're right
2014-02-13 00:27:19	tac	or limits up to some cardinaltiy
2014-02-13 00:27:50	tac	usually, the difference between finite and not, though, is what you need to care about
2014-02-13 00:28:05	imprimable	yes as in set theory
2014-02-13 00:28:05	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-13 00:28:14	imprimable	it is hard to "take the limit" :}}
2014-02-13 00:28:21	imprimable	(lets take the limit of limits)
2014-02-13 00:29:48	mr-	FinSet is neither complete nor cocomplete
2014-02-13 00:30:51	mr-	Some posets are not co/complete
2014-02-13 00:31:01	mr-	I wouldn't say it is pedestrian
2014-02-13 00:31:38	tac	mr-: If you came across a minivan in the parking lot, you wouldn't be surprised
2014-02-13 00:32:02	tac	Similarly, if you find your category has all limits and colimits, you might make a note of it and move on with what you're doing.
2014-02-13 00:32:19	tac	(I don't know where that analogy came from, but whatever :P)
2014-02-13 00:32:45	engimo	that is incredibly wrong
2014-02-13 00:33:06	mr-	I don't agree. It has often been a huge deal for me ;-)
2014-02-13 00:33:16	engimo	the existence of limits/colimits is quite a delicate point, especially when you are dealing with model structures etc etc
2014-02-13 00:33:29	engimo	doing anything Derived makes this a big issue
2014-02-13 00:33:40	tac	It's useful to know, but it's not particularly rare.
2014-02-13 00:33:48	engimo	again, that's wrong
2014-02-13 00:33:50	imprimable	engimo: i was asking myself a question about "type" of products and "type" of equalizers
2014-02-13 00:33:55	imprimable	maybe you can answer me
2014-02-13 00:34:11	imprimable	in Set, there is only "one type" of product, or coproduct because the construction works for all pair of objects
2014-02-13 00:34:21	engimo	sure
2014-02-13 00:34:26	imprimable	does it exist some category in which there is no such "universal" constructing process ?
2014-02-13 00:34:49	engimo	are you asking if you can have subcategories that have (co)products while the ambient category does not, or what
2014-02-13 00:34:53	imprimable	and if so, is there a criterion to know that in such catregory, it won't be possible to construct "universaly" such product ?
2014-02-13 00:34:59	imprimable	no
2014-02-13 00:35:04	engimo	i don't get your question
2014-02-13 00:35:28	imprimable	i'm asking if it spossible that a product of A and B be the cartesian product, say, and of B and C, something else
2014-02-13 00:35:32	imprimable	like the disjoint union
2014-02-13 00:35:36	imprimable	(i know its false but you get it)
2014-02-13 00:35:59	engimo	sure, why not
2014-02-13 00:36:03	imprimable	because there's nothing that tells me that there exist such "universal constructing" process
2014-02-13 00:36:23	imprimable	do you have an example and if yes, is there a criterion to know if a category admits such universal constructing process or not ?
2014-02-13 00:36:32	engimo	i don't think that's a well-defined notion
2014-02-13 00:36:47	engimo	the only reason we see AxB and BxC as "constructed the same" is because of our brain problems
2014-02-13 00:37:01	imprimable	well i disagree
2014-02-13 00:37:06	imprimable	there might be some hidden concept behind
2014-02-13 00:37:11	imprimable	which explain xwhat it means to be constructed the same
2014-02-13 00:37:21	engimo	well, define what that means and I'm happy to think about it
2014-02-13 00:37:24	imprimable	(modulo isomorphism, of course)
2014-02-13 00:37:39	imprimable	maybe an algorithm
2014-02-13 00:37:39	imprimable	i dunno

2014-02-13 04:23:47	tomprince	Well, every object j will be the codomain of id_j. But there will be multiple ("disjoint") copies, if there are more arrows.
2014-02-13 04:24:21	imprimable	true
2014-02-13 04:24:36	imprimable	so if i have
2014-02-13 04:24:43	imprimable	i -> j <- k
2014-02-13 04:24:48	imprimable	i will have DjxDj
2014-02-13 04:24:49	imprimable	ok
2014-02-13 04:41:10	imprimable	so once you have the concept of limit
2014-02-13 04:41:29	imprimable	you "know" everything about the general relations between th objects of a category ?
2014-02-13 04:41:37	imprimable	because it encompass all "types" of diagrams
2014-02-13 04:42:02	imprimable	(limit and colimit of course)
2014-02-13 04:50:16	tomprince	I'm not sure what "knowing everything" means.
2014-02-13 04:56:45	imprimable	in the sense that because of associativity of arrows
2014-02-13 04:56:54	imprimable	you only have "4 types" of elementary diagrams
2014-02-13 04:57:00	imprimable	A -> B <- C
2014-02-13 04:57:06	imprimable	A <- B -> C
2014-02-13 04:57:09	imprimable	A -> B
2014-02-13 04:57:19	imprimable	A => B (double arrows)
2014-02-13 04:57:59	imprimable	first "type" of diagram is associated to coproduct, second product, third to maps, last to equilizers
2014-02-13 04:58:08	imprimable	or third to terminal/iniital object if you wish
2014-02-13 04:58:35	imprimable	therefore, we have "all kind of universal diagrams" possible that are encompassed by the concept of limit
2014-02-13 04:58:55	imprimable	the other ones are just some "composition" of those elementary ones
2014-02-13 04:59:44	tac	imprimable: Except that doesn't handle the case of an infinite diagram
2014-02-13 05:00:06	imprimable	true
2014-02-13 05:00:07	tac	imprimable: Have you gotten to the part yet where Awodey explains that "diagram" just means "image of a functor" yet?
2014-02-13 05:00:17	imprimable	yes, thats the definition of limit
2014-02-13 05:00:18	tac	That was really fun when I first saw it
2014-02-13 05:00:20	imprimable	with cone and stuff
2014-02-13 05:00:25	tac	Yeah
2014-02-13 05:00:26	imprimable	the definition of limit is just
2014-02-13 05:00:27	imprimable	really really smart
2014-02-13 05:00:33	imprimable	it really captures the ump
2014-02-13 05:00:36	tac	They are used in the definition of a limit
2014-02-13 05:00:43	tac	but they are more general than that, of course :)
2014-02-13 05:00:46	imprimable	i dunno who though about it first
2014-02-13 05:00:50	imprimable	but its really beautiful
2014-02-13 05:00:50	tac	((Co)Limits are just one kind of UMP)
2014-02-13 05:00:53	imprimable	how it captures the ump
2014-02-13 05:00:58	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 05:01:03	imprimable	the ones related wth the 4 diagrams i draw
2014-02-13 05:01:09	imprimable	ie, with all "basics" relations
2014-02-13 05:01:20	tac	One of the major lessons from category theory is to use the yoneda embedding to make shitty categories less shitty
2014-02-13 05:01:38	imprimable	hm i think this comes in 50 pages
2014-02-13 05:01:40	imprimable	so i'm far from it yet
2014-02-13 05:01:41	tac	And the yoneda embedding always gives you back a "category of functors"
2014-02-13 05:01:44	imprimable	in 2 weeks maybe i will see it
2014-02-13 05:01:47	tac	Aka, a category of diagrams
2014-02-13 05:01:53	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 05:01:59	imprimable	so basically
2014-02-13 05:02:04	imprimable	the study of functors
2014-02-13 05:02:07	imprimable	is the study of structure
2014-02-13 05:02:08	imprimable	so basically
2014-02-13 05:02:12	imprimable	CT "true" meaning
2014-02-13 05:02:15	imprimable	is the study of functors ?
2014-02-13 05:02:21	tomprince	If you want to say something with interesting content, you would need a way to express all the limits/colimits in a catgoery that doesn't explicitly encode the category. (Since a limit is the limit of a diagram, which is a functor to the category)
2014-02-13 05:02:52	tomprince	So, part of the *data* of a limit is the category in which it is a limit.
2014-02-13 05:02:52	tac	well, MacLane is famous for asserting that category theory was invente for natural transformations
2014-02-13 05:03:07	tac	But yeah, I'd say that "functor categories" are one of the most important things to take home
2014-02-13 05:03:23	imprimable	let me read that again tomprince
2014-02-13 05:03:26	imprimable	ok i see tac
2014-02-13 05:03:32	tomprince	"true meaning" I think is a meaningless phrase. Category theory is what it is, and there are lots of interesting things you can do with it. But it doesn't have a meaning.
2014-02-13 05:04:43	imprimable	ok so basically
2014-02-13 05:04:47	imprimable	what you're saying tomprince is
2014-02-13 05:05:20	imprimable	a category is "related" by all the other categories of diagram that encode limit of your former category
2014-02-13 05:05:25	imprimable	so its like saying
2014-02-13 05:06:08	imprimable	your space is caracterize by all the representation on itself ?
2014-02-13 05:06:13	imprimable	your aglebra
2014-02-13 05:06:14	imprimable	say
2014-02-13 05:07:07	tomprince	No, I'm saying something simpler
2014-02-13 05:07:34	Cale	imprimable: MacLane said that he invented categories to be able to discuss functors, and he invented functors to be able to discuss natural transformations :)
2014-02-13 05:07:52	Cale	(If I'm not butchering the quote too much :)
2014-02-13 05:08:01	tomprince	If you have (x, y, z, (l, m, n, (C, x))) then of course you already have to know C.
2014-02-13 05:08:01	imprimable	well i guess mac lane was really smart to understand that "in one though"
2014-02-13 05:08:33	Cale	There was a lot of stuff along those lines which was starting to appear, and he had the good idea of capturing it into its own notion.
2014-02-13 05:08:44	tomprince	Part of the data giving a limit is a functor, and part of the data of a functor is a category. So if your are given a limit you know the category.

2014-02-13 05:10:21	tomprince	I'm responding to your question about "knowing everything" about a category from its limits. I'm pointing out why "knowing everything" seems like a meaningless question.
2014-02-13 05:10:39	imprimable	yes i guess i didn't express myself well
2014-02-13 05:10:42	imprimable	what i wanted to say
2014-02-13 05:10:49	imprimable	is all the "elementary blocks" of relations
2014-02-13 05:11:06	imprimable	are contained inside product, equalizers, coproduct, coequilizers, which is of course equivalent to limits
2014-02-13 05:11:14	imprimable	(if you have all of them etc etc)
2014-02-13 05:11:23	Cale	imprimable: If there's some sort of central philosophical message to category theory, it's that we should never be content to study structures in isolation, but instead should always examine the mappings and relationships between various structures of a particular type, because that's the major tool that we use throughout mathematics to break things apart into pieces which can be understood, and synthesize unde
2014-02-13 05:11:23	Cale	rstanding of more complicated structures from understanding of simpler ones.
2014-02-13 05:11:55	imprimable	something that was really beautiful i found out
2014-02-13 05:11:59	imprimable	was an example of awodey in poset
2014-02-13 05:12:07	imprimable	how some invariant of an object

2014-02-13 05:12:24	imprimable	they are not "self contained"
2014-02-13 05:12:41	tomprince	imprimable: I'm not sure that "elementary blocks" is a interesting thing to have all of.
2014-02-13 05:12:44	imprimable	what you're saying Cale, is that this also holds for catgory themselves ?

2014-02-13 05:13:14	imprimable	but maybe it means one can reformulate what is a category by the knowledge of its "elementary blocs of relations"
2014-02-13 05:13:15	imprimable	ie
2014-02-13 05:13:19	imprimable	products and equalizers
2014-02-13 05:13:26	Cale	imprimable: It holds for pretty much everything we want to be able to understand.
2014-02-13 05:13:42	tomprince	It isn't clear to me that those are elementary in the way you want them.
2014-02-13 05:13:58	tomprince	Since something being a product or an equalizer is (partly) a global thing.
2014-02-13 05:14:08	imprimable	because of associativity of maps it really looks like it is "elementary"
2014-02-13 05:14:10	imprimable	yes thats true
2014-02-13 05:14:12	imprimable	because of ump
2014-02-13 05:14:23	imprimable	that is why i "claim"
2014-02-13 05:14:32	imprimable	that it might be possible to entirely characterize a category
2014-02-13 05:14:40	imprimable	if you know about all these elementary blocs of relationss
2014-02-13 05:14:49	imprimable	which are equilizers, products, coproduct, and coequilizers
2014-02-13 05:15:13	imprimable	maybe you have to add initial and terminal objects too
2014-02-13 05:15:25	imprimable	so you have "every type of structure" there
2014-02-13 05:15:25	tomprince	I don' think that is more elementary that (C, id, o)
2014-02-13 05:15:37	imprimable	well (C,id,o) is "local"
2014-02-13 05:15:46	imprimable	such characterization would indeed be global because of um
2014-02-13 05:15:47	imprimable	p
2014-02-13 05:16:11	imprimable	maybe there are some known theorems about that
2014-02-13 05:16:51	tomprince	I think more intresting caracterizations of something as elemetary bits is something like C/x or all x in C. (the slice categories).
2014-02-13 05:17:07	Cale	Well, there are lots of ways to chop things up
2014-02-13 05:18:01	tomprince	Or, given F: C -> B, looking at F^{-1}(b), and induced functors between them (if such things exist).
2014-02-13 05:18:38	imprimable	but functors doesn't necessarily preserve products and stuff
2014-02-13 05:18:38	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-13 05:19:35	Cale	right
2014-02-13 05:19:47	Cale	A functor which preserves all limits is called continuous.
2014-02-13 05:19:56	Cale	(small limits)
2014-02-13 05:20:17	imprimable	so it might not be good to look at functors
2014-02-13 05:20:40	Cale	Well, it depends on what you're trying to see :)
2014-02-13 05:20:46	imprimable	yes, true too
2014-02-13 05:21:06	imprimable	but if you want to characterize your category by looking at its product and equilizers
2014-02-13 05:21:12	imprimable	you don't want to look at functors
2014-02-13 05:21:36	imprimable	or you would have to look at functors that preserve the structure
2014-02-13 05:25:16	Cale	A category for which all small limits exist (i.e. limits of functors J -> C where J is a small category) is called a complete category. Examples of complete categories include the categories of sets, topological spaces, groups, Abelian groups, rings, vector spaces over a field, and indeed the category of all small categories.
2014-02-13 05:26:00	Cale	(and in fact, all of those examples also have all small colimits)
2014-02-13 05:27:23	Cale	So if you're hoping to describe which category you have by saying which diagrams have limits, those examples sort of spoil the plan.
2014-02-13 05:28:26	imprimable	hm no
2014-02-13 05:29:06	imprimable	i just feel like as simple groups are "elementary blocs of groups" in group theory
2014-02-13 05:29:35	imprimable	products, equilizer, coproduct, coequilizer, and initial and terminal objects are "elementary blocs of relations" in category theory
2014-02-13 05:29:59	Cale	Well, if by relations you mean limits and colimits respectively, then yeah
2014-02-13 05:30:13	imprimable	no i mean all kind of ump
2014-02-13 05:30:29	Cale	There are UMPs which are more general than limits or colimits
2014-02-13 05:30:35	Cale	Well...
2014-02-13 05:30:36	Cale	:)
2014-02-13 05:30:48	imprimable	more general but they can be constructed with the 6 operations i cited
2014-02-13 05:30:49	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-13 05:30:52	imprimable	or can't they ?
2014-02-13 05:31:02	Cale	I shouldn't exactly say that, because you can pretty much always invent a new category in which your universal thing will be an initial object.
2014-02-13 05:31:08	Cale	(or a terminal object)
2014-02-13 05:31:36	Cale	imprimable: How do you plan to describe exponential objects?
2014-02-13 05:31:46	imprimable	i don't know what is an exponential object
2014-02-13 05:32:07	imprimable	this comes after in awodey
2014-02-13 05:32:32	Cale	Yeah, there are more widgets to care about than examples of limits and colimits.
2014-02-13 05:32:42	Cale	(Though limits and colimits take you quite far in practice)
2014-02-13 05:32:55	imprimable	well i claim that they are equivalent to "some kind" of equilizer & stuff
2014-02-13 05:33:00	Cale	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object
2014-02-13 05:33:15	imprimable	as a pullback is just an equilizer for which ...
2014-02-13 05:34:06	imprimable	ok maybe the exponential are ALSO part of the "elementary blocs" of relation
2014-02-13 05:34:13	imprimable	because it has two disjoint diagram
2014-02-13 05:36:54	Cale	imprimable: So, there are these things called adjunctions which do a somewhat better job of capturing more of the things we'd like to call "universal mapping properties"
2014-02-13 05:38:01	imprimable	yes i heard about them
2014-02-13 05:38:03	imprimable	but those are functorial
2014-02-13 05:38:04	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-13 05:40:58	Cale	They're pairs of functors F: D -> C and G: C -> D, between two categories which have the property that the arrows FA -> B are in natural bijective correspondence with arrows A -> GB
2014-02-13 05:41:20	Cale	So, you might think back to the free/forgetful pair with monoids
2014-02-13 05:41:58	imprimable	i don't know what is a natural correspondence
2014-02-13 05:42:03	imprimable	you explained it to me but i forgot
2014-02-13 05:42:17	imprimable	i just remembered that it only keeps the structure
2014-02-13 05:42:21	tomprince	imprimable: It almost seems like you are trying to say "I've learned enough about category theory, since everything interesting can be captured by these things I just learned about".
2014-02-13 05:42:24	imprimable	its like a weak isomorphism that allows permutation
2014-02-13 05:42:27	Cale	Well, let's just approximate that with bijection for now
2014-02-13 05:42:43	imprimable	tomprince: thats what i claim for everything INSIDE a category
2014-02-13 05:42:46	Cale	(it's a little more than that, but bijection will do to understand some examples)
2014-02-13 05:43:54	tomprince	I'm not sure there will ever be a point where one can say category theory is done, we've said all that can be said.
2014-02-13 05:43:55	Cale	Given any set A and monoid B, if FA is the free monoid on A, and GB is the underlying set of B, then monoid homomorphisms FA -> B are in bijective correspondence with functions A -> GB
2014-02-13 05:44:16	imprimable	tomprince: ahah no, i'm not saying its done, just that they are "elementary blocs", the rest is emerging from them
2014-02-13 05:44:23	imprimable	like "particles" in physics
2014-02-13 05:44:41	imprimable	let me read that again Cale
2014-02-13 05:44:51	tomprince	The elementary blocks are objects and arrows.
2014-02-13 05:45:05	tomprince	Or even, just arrows.
2014-02-13 05:45:14	Cale	(Or even, just the composition maps)
2014-02-13 05:45:20	Cale	:)
2014-02-13 05:45:35	Cale	How the arrows compose with each other is the important bit
2014-02-13 05:46:05	imprimable	ok
2014-02-13 05:46:07	imprimable	i understood cale
2014-02-13 05:46:09	imprimable	going up
2014-02-13 05:46:10	imprimable	or going down
2014-02-13 05:46:14	imprimable	is bijective
2014-02-13 05:46:56	imprimable	tomprince: the elementary blocs of "structure"
2014-02-13 05:47:04	imprimable	are equilizers and products (and their dual)
2014-02-13 05:47:26	imprimable	maybe exponential too, i'm not yet familiar enough with them
2014-02-13 05:48:26	tac	imprimable: You seem to place so much importance on these things!
2014-02-13 05:48:36	imprimable	whats the problem ? ahah
2014-02-13 05:48:37	tac	They are neat. They aren't the end-all-be-all of the philosophy of mathematics :X
2014-02-13 05:49:05	tac	And given any concept, you can always generalize it.
2014-02-13 05:49:10	Cale	imprimable: i.e. if you give me a monoid homomorphism h: FA -> B, then I can see what it does on each of the one-element words in FA, and define a function h*: A -> GB which sends a to h([a]), where [a] is the one-element word, and we're implicitly taking h([a]) to be an element of the underlying set here
2014-02-13 05:49:40	Cale	and dually (and more interestingly), I can invert this process
2014-02-13 05:51:26	imprimable	i see
2014-02-13 05:51:34	Cale	Given any function at all h*: A -> GB, I can extend this to a homomorphism h: FA -> B, which will have the property that h([a]) = h*(a), and the behaviour of h on all other words will then be determined by the laws for a monoid homomorphism
2014-02-13 05:52:09	Cale	e.g. h([a,b,c]) = h*(a) h*(b) h*(c), where on the right we're doing multiplication in B.
2014-02-13 05:52:19	imprimable	i'm getting lost
2014-02-13 05:52:22	imprimable	i should write it
2014-02-13 05:52:22	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-13 05:54:32	imprimable	Cale
2014-02-13 05:54:45	imprimable	do you know a bit about what you talked to me last time
2014-02-13 05:55:00	imprimable	category theory where the composition is only taken up to isomorphism ?
2014-02-13 05:55:27	Cale	imprimable: yeah, that happens in higher dimensional categories
2014-02-13 05:55:38	imprimable	can't you rewrite whole CT with that ?
2014-02-13 05:56:52	Cale	You can, but nobody knows how to do it in a really elegant way yet. There are something like 6 or 7 ways to do it, and it's hard to study the relationships between them because these things are themselves the tool to study such relationships :)
2014-02-13 05:57:17	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-13 05:57:19	imprimable	i see :>
2014-02-13 05:57:52	Cale	The complication arises because there are lots of laws which you'd like to be able to say you have
2014-02-13 05:58:04	Cale	there are an infinite number of them, if you try to do it naively
2014-02-13 05:58:12	imprimable	ah
2014-02-13 05:58:30	Cale	You need to express some kind of general principle about how the different levels of arrows and arrows-between-arrows and so on all interact with each other

2014-02-13 06:18:25	Cale	imprimable: Generally, if A and B are sets, then we define a function f: A -> B to be a triple (A,B,G) where G is a subset of the Cartesian product A x B such that for any a in A, there is exactly one b in B such that (a,b) is in G.
2014-02-13 06:18:42	Cale	when (a,b) is in G, we write f(a) = b
2014-02-13 06:19:38	Cale	So, let's take A and B both to be the empty set. G must then be a subset of the Cartesian product of the empty set and itself, which is again the empty set, so our hands are tied about what G is if this is to be a function.
2014-02-13 06:19:59	imprimable	ok
2014-02-13 06:20:27	Cale	and then we just have to see that the condition is satisfied: for every a in A, do we have that ... well, yes. A is empty, so any property whatsoever will hold of all its elements.

2014-02-13 06:29:03	Cale	It's fairly standard in most places in higher mathematics to insist that functions f: A -> B are defined on all elements of A. You can weaken the definition so that they're allowed to be defined only on a subset of A, but those are usually called partial functions, and partial functions are not considered to be functions :)
2014-02-13 06:29:24	Cale	(unless they're actually defined everywhere in their domain)
2014-02-13 06:29:52	Cale	The confusion as I see it is actually not between functions and partial functions, but between functions and equations that might be satisfied by functions.
2014-02-13 06:29:57	imprimable	yes
2014-02-13 06:30:20	Cale	It's common to say "the function f(x) = x^2", because once you know what the domain and codomain are supposed to be, this equation is satisfied by just one function.
2014-02-13 06:31:21	Cale	But if you don't say what you intend the domain and codomain to be, it's really ambiguous, even if you know that x^2 indicates multiplication of real numbers, for instance.

2014-02-13 23:57:43	imprimable	i have a question about the definition of creating limit functor
2014-02-13 23:58:01	imprimable	suppose i have a functor F : C -> D that creates limit of type J in D
2014-02-13 23:58:41	imprimable	because a limit is just an object modulo isomorphism
2014-02-13 23:58:57	imprimable	does it mean that creating limit is a process from "larger" category to "smaller" ones ?
2014-02-13 23:59:18	imprimable	you only require that for all limit in D there is a unique limit limit in C such that its image by F is equal to the limit in D
2014-02-14 00:00:10	imprimable	which means that in C

2014-02-14 00:00:26	imprimable	you can have limit that are not in D right ?
2014-02-14 00:00:44	imprimable	i don't understand the uniqueness criterion i think
2014-02-14 00:06:00	imprimable	and i don't understand why the colimit of a diagram of "omega type" on groups in Group is called G_infinity
2014-02-14 00:06:22	imprimable	why is the colimit object though as the one at infinity
2014-02-14 00:07:25	tac	imprimable: colimits are more closely related to the term "limit" in terms of calculus
2014-02-14 00:08:23	tac	well, depending on the setup
2014-02-14 00:08:57	imprimable	i think i understand "why" it is as infinity when you look at its construction with equivalent class
2014-02-14 00:09:26	imprimable	it has all kind of object that starts everywhere in the sequence of group and are related by a "path" from it to infinity
2014-02-14 00:09:27	imprimable	ye
2014-02-14 00:09:29	imprimable	ok
2014-02-14 00:09:55	imprimable	maybe you can help me tac
2014-02-14 00:09:59	imprimable	about creating limit functor
2014-02-14 00:10:19	imprimable	what does the uniqueness condition means ?
2014-02-14 00:12:08	tac	uniqueness of what now?
2014-02-14 00:12:38	imprimable	<imprimable> suppose i have a functor F : C -> D that creates limit of type J in D
2014-02-14 00:12:38	imprimable	<imprimable> because a limit is just an object modulo isomorphism

2014-02-14 03:48:12	imprimable	tomprince: i'm not sure to understand well the idea of crezating limit
2014-02-14 03:48:12	imprimable	still
2014-02-14 03:49:01	imprimable	imagine i have a diagram of type J, J -> C, and a functor F : C -> D
2014-02-14 03:49:27	imprimable	and let lim <- Dj be the limit in C of the diagram of type J
2014-02-14 03:49:42	imprimable	this object is taken modulo isomorphism
2014-02-14 03:49:43	imprimable	so basically
2014-02-14 03:49:56	imprimable	what does the "unique" part means in the definition of creating limit
2014-02-14 03:50:13	imprimable	why do we force the uniqueness
2014-02-14 03:51:04	imprimable	ah
2014-02-14 03:51:06	imprimable	i think i understand

2014-02-14 03:51:17	imprimable	it means that you keep the same "number" of isomorphism objects
2014-02-14 03:52:10	imprimable	yes ok
2014-02-14 03:52:21	imprimable	so taking the image by F doesn't create new limit
2014-02-14 03:52:24	imprimable	it can only "collapse" them
2014-02-14 03:52:31	imprimable	so there is less limit in D than in C
2014-02-14 03:52:55	imprimable	the terminology i weird
2014-02-14 03:53:16	imprimable	its missleading

2014-02-14 04:18:27	mr-	I have never heard of that terminology. But a functor does not have to preserve limits, even though if both categories are complete
2014-02-14 04:19:10	imprimable	can a functor send a non limit cones to a limit one ?
2014-02-14 04:20:14	notdan	um possibly
2014-02-14 04:20:40	notdan	perservance of limits is a very important property, I would say
2014-02-14 04:21:39	imprimable	well
2014-02-14 04:21:44	mr-	imprimable: sure, take the category with only one object and the identity morphism
2014-02-14 04:21:49	imprimable	Hom(-,C) doesn't preserve limits notdan
2014-02-14 04:21:56	notdan	A functor can take a non limt to a limit
2014-02-14 04:22:22	imprimable	ok mr-
2014-02-14 04:22:22	notdan	for example F(A) = X, F(B) = Y and F(C) = XxY
2014-02-14 04:22:23	imprimable	yes
2014-02-14 04:22:28	notdan	if C is not a product
2014-02-14 04:22:44	imprimable	yes
2014-02-14 04:22:46	imprimable	your example works too
2014-02-14 04:22:47	notdan	btw Hom(C,-) preserves limits, I've learned that very recently myself
2014-02-14 04:22:54	imprimable	ah
2014-02-14 04:22:55	imprimable	its nice
2014-02-14 04:22:58	notdan	Hom(-,C) preserves colimits then
2014-02-14 04:23:02	imprimable	because it tells you that Hom(-C) preserve colimit
2014-02-14 04:23:02	imprimable	yes

2014-02-14 04:25:11	mr-	wait, what?
2014-02-14 04:25:40	mr-	it does not _preserve_ colimits. Look at what the shape of the resulting cone is.
2014-02-14 04:25:57	notdan	it doesn't????
2014-02-14 04:26:00	notdan	but... symmetry....
2014-02-14 04:26:19	copumpkin	it DESTROYS colimits
2014-02-14 04:26:29	notdan	holy shit
2014-02-14 04:26:44	mr-	Say you have a map A -> B, that induces a map Hom(B,C) -> Hom(A,C) by precomposition
2014-02-14 04:26:49	mr-	so it takes a cocone to a cone
2014-02-14 04:27:00	notdan	ah, so it turns limits to colimits?
2014-02-14 04:27:05	mr-	hence hom(colim,C) = lim hom( ,C)
2014-02-14 04:27:09	mr-	colimits to limits
2014-02-14 04:27:15	notdan	derp
2014-02-14 04:27:29	mr-	and hom(c, lim) = lim hom(c, )

2014-02-14 04:28:32	notdan	wait, limits in C are co-limtits in C^op , aren't they?
2014-02-14 04:28:48	mr-	That's the spirit :-)
2014-02-14 04:29:01	mr-	contravariant functors are teh devil
2014-02-14 04:29:24	notdan	and co-limits in C are limits in C^op?
2014-02-14 04:30:00	notdan	So if we view a contravariant Hom(-,C) as a covariant functor from C^op we arrive at the conclusion that Hom(-,C) flips limits and colimits
2014-02-14 04:30:16	notdan	is that the case?
2014-02-14 04:30:39	Saizan	it is the case

2014-02-14 04:30:55	imprimable	indeed
2014-02-14 04:31:00	imprimable	Hom(-,C) send a colim to a limit
2014-02-14 04:31:22	imprimable	in Sets for example

2014-02-14 17:00:38	Saizan	would you say that the equalizer of f and g is the most general solution to the equation f . x = g . x ?
2014-02-14 17:13:29	Cale	That's not a bad interpretation
2014-02-14 17:16:26	Cale	You might think of the equaliser of f, g: X -> Y as being the "part" of X on which those maps act equally.
2014-02-14 17:16:54	Cale	e.g. in the category of sets, it's {x in X | f(x) = g(x)} (with the obvious inclusion)
2014-02-14 17:24:18	Saizan	*nod*
2014-02-14 17:26:04	Saizan	the thing is that i'm used to the universal morphism being postcomposed when talking about most general (from discussing unification), but i guess precomposing is just another way to specialize
2014-02-14 17:27:44	Saizan	and in fact iirc Goguen has a whole thing about thinking of unifiers as equalisers (by looking at substitutions the other way around) so i'd be in good company
2014-02-14 17:29:11	Saizan	..well, not quite because i'm using equalisers without reversing the category, so it's really distinct, but it's because of some other contravariance stuff going on
2014-02-14 17:37:05	Cale	I suppose if you're worried about the use of the word "general" you could always say "universal" instead and never risk being confusing.
2014-02-14 17:38:40	Cale	Any other solution to f . x = g . x factors through this one uniquely.
2014-02-14 17:41:55	Saizan	in a sense the ambiguity is kinda helpful, because i'm going to use x's universal property to prove the postcomposing notion of generality of a substitution built from x, so i'd rather not introduce a new concept just to show it matches the old one

2014-02-18 03:13:37	imprimable	question
2014-02-18 03:13:51	imprimable	is the evaluation map unique for exponential ?
2014-02-18 03:14:22	imprimable	wait, let me try to demonstrate it
2014-02-18 03:15:50	tac	imprimable: it is by definition
2014-02-18 03:15:58	imprimable	i can't demontrate it ?
2014-02-18 03:16:07	tac	If your evaluation map isn't unique, the thing you're considering isn't actually an exponential
2014-02-18 03:16:11	imprimable	ok
2014-02-18 03:16:22	imprimable	so you can't demonstrate it with the ump
2014-02-18 03:16:27	tac	What you might want to try is to take a well-known exponential (in sets or whatever) and show that it is in fact unique
2014-02-18 03:16:29	imprimable	because by definition it is unique
2014-02-18 03:16:37	imprimable	yes in set its obvious
2014-02-18 03:16:39	imprimable	i did it
2014-02-18 03:16:46	imprimable	but for general CCC i don't know
2014-02-18 03:16:52	tac	It's part of the definition that it must be unique
2014-02-18 03:16:55	imprimable	ok
2014-02-18 03:17:09	imprimable	in set you can demonstrate it so i though you could also in some gneral CCC
2014-02-18 03:17:11	imprimable	thx
2014-02-18 03:17:24	imprimable	its important
2014-02-18 03:17:29	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) が ##categorytheory に参加
2014-02-18 03:17:34	imprimable	in the demonstration that the exponentiation is a functor
2014-02-18 03:17:37	imprimable	you need the uniqueness
2014-02-18 03:23:25	tomprince	imprimable: In Set, what you are doing is demonstrating that some particular construction *is* an exponetial, rather than proving some property hold of an exponential.
2014-02-18 03:24:05	imprimable	yes, but the exponential is unique as an object right ?
2014-02-18 03:24:27	tomprince	Well, up to isomorphism. And it need not exist.
2014-02-18 03:24:31	imprimable	yes of course
2014-02-18 03:24:33	imprimable	as alway
2014-02-18 03:24:35	imprimable	s
2014-02-18 03:25:36	tomprince	In set, you say "Take the set of all functions from A to B. Now I'm going to show that this is an exponential ....."
2014-02-18 03:26:06	tomprince	In a different category, you would need to provide a different object, and show that it too satisfies the requsite properties.
2014-02-18 03:26:23	imprimable	yes, you exhibit some construction that is an exponential, and becauseit is unique up to isomorphism
2014-02-18 03:26:30	imprimable	you jsut demonstrated that set is CCC
2014-02-18 03:28:09	tomprince	Well, you need to show it is unique to say it is an exponential.
2014-02-18 03:28:26	tomprince	That is part of exhibiting it as an exponential.
2014-02-18 03:30:06	imprimable	yes
2014-02-18 03:30:08	imprimable	but it obvious in set
2014-02-18 03:30:49	tomprince	"obvious" is a dangerous word.
2014-02-18 03:31:38	imprimable	thats true, but it follows directly from the transpose and its inverse
2014-02-18 03:34:02	imprimable	is there a link between exponentials and slice categories ?

2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:07:30] if i understood well, a->b, in a heyting algebra view as a lattice, is the biggest element c such that c /\ a <= b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:07:31] right ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:19:00] i don't understan
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:19:09] why are completeness and cocompleteness equivalent for posets ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:20:11] i can easily imagine a hasse diagram of some poset bounded from belows but thats it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:20:20] that then stops
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:20:36] without any initial element 0
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:22:10] this makes no sense omg
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:29:30] can anyone help me
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:29:30] : <
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:36:36]  why are completeness and co completeness equivalent for poset view as a category ? this makes no sense, i can easily construct a hasse diagram that is not bounded upside
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:36:49] someone help me : (
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:36:55] i feel like i don't understand shit
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:38:24] hi
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:38:28] hi
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:38:37] can you help me Cale ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:38:40] maybe I can help, let me look (just waking up here)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:38:44] thx a lot
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:38:55] i really don't understnad why this property should hold
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:39:21] completeness is equivalent in a poset category to existace of meet (because coequilizers are trivials)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:39:25] but WHY joins too
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:39:28] can't get it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:39:50] i really feel its false
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:10] for example, the 3 category \/
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:22] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:23] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Saizan	[01:40:27] well, for example, the bottom element is the meet of the whole set or the join of the empty set, (or vice versa i never remeber which way meet and join are)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:48] the 3 category is a poset
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:49] \/
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:50] right ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:52] it is complete
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:40:54] how is that cocomplete ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:41:32] or maybe i didn't understand what complete means ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:42:11] No, that does sound a bit strange
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Saizan	[01:42:50] mh, isn't the theorem more like "if you are both complete and cocomplete then you are a poset"?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:43:05] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:43:21] awodey's saying "for posets, completeness and cocompleteness are equivalents"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:43:22] Oh, right
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:43:30] maybe he wrote it bad
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:43:33] A poset is complete iff it's a complete lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:43:50] yes, and the 3 lattice \/ is a complete lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:43:57] but its by no mean cocomplete
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:44:56] No, in the order theoretical sense of having all meets and joins
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:45:28] then its not "for posets"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:45:32] but "for bounded posets"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:45:45] then ok, it works easily with opposite category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:45:50] by duality
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:46:27] hm, and even "bounded posets" don't work
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:46:37] because meet and joint are not necessarily uniques
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:46:57] so a bounded poset is not necessarily a lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:50:31] \/ isn't complete because it has no terminal object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:22] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:26] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:31] OK
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:32] i see
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:43] i just understood
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:44] thx
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:55] a complete poset is a poset bounded from bellow that has a terminal object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:51:58] so it is a lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:00] so it is cocomplete
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:13] this makes sense
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:33] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:39] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:39] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:47] and of course there is an initial object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:57] if you take the meet of all elements
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:52:59] it exists
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:53:04] it is the initial object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:53:04] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[01:53:08] right
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:53:24] so you have a poset with initial and terminal object and all meet
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:54:09] now you have to prove that it has all join
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[01:59:39] how can you prove that
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:00:05] i could define the join with meet and "negation" but here
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:00:05] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:00:37] So what is the join of some set of elements? It's the *least* element which is larger than all of them. So what diagram might we use to make sure that it's less than everything it's supposed to be?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:01:09] equalizer
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:01:26] I mean, we know that we have all limits
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:01:48] So, the idea is to pick some category J and functor F: J -> C
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:02:03] yes, so we have to take a diagram of the form >-
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:02:11] I think it will be profitable to choose J here as a particular subcategory of C
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:02:12] or -
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:02:15] and F as an inclusion
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:02:35] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:02:37] let me write it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:03:01] Remember, we don't have to worry about whether triangles commute
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:03:33] oh
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:03:34] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:03:37] juste . .
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:03:40] Stare at the diagram for a limit, and think about how we might choose F to get the ordering relations we want :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:04:05] hm no this one gives me the mee
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:04:05] t
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:04:26] We want the image of F to consist of everything which is supposed to be *after* the meet, right?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:04:34] er, the join rather
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:04:35] heh
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:04:37] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:17] so we take 1 < ^a_b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:21] erm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:22] no
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:25] because it will be <= a
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:27] and a<= b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:05:28] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:07:31] just .1 ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:07:36] what?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:07:37] because by ump
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:07:42] the terminal object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:07:45] as a digram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:07:46] just "."
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:08:10] then by ump
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:08:21] http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Functor_cone_%28extended%29.svg -- look at this diagram (nevermind that it's upside-down)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:09:06] well here it the meet
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:09:13] We want L = a \/ b, or more generally L = \/ S where S is some set of elements of our poset
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:09:31] So, how do we choose F?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:09:45] We know L will exist, for any F
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:10:08] So, which things are supposed to be larger than or equal to the join?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:17] the initial element
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:10:21] no
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:26] erm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:27] TERMINA
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:28] L
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:28] :>
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:29] the 1
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:10:35] Well, sure, it will be
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:10:44] But lots of other things as well
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:10:46] which other things?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:49] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:55] everyone such that there exists an arrow
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:10:57] from the join to them
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:11:09] ... that's what it means to be larger, yeah :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:11:11] so as a diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:11:21] we take everyone that is "larger" than the join
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:11:22] But we're trying to show that the join exists
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:11:30] so we need to specify a and b yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:11:31] So can you say that in a way which doesn't involve the join?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:11:48] In terms of a and b, what things are larger than a \/ b?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:09] (or equal to)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:12:24] well, 1 is
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:29] nonono
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:37] EXACTLY which things?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:41] 1 is larger than everything
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:43] so that's boring
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:12:46] then any p such that a <= p and b <= p
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:12:51] yes!
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:13:13] So, how might we choose F so that its image is all of those p such that a <= p and b <= p?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:13:24] Well, we can obviously choose such an F, right?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:27] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:31] because we know <=
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:36] so we take all object p
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:40] such that a <= p and b <= p
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:52] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:13:56] let me look the diagram again
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:13:56] You can either make it a functor from a discrete category, or you can use the inclusion of that subcategory
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:19] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:21] you do that
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:22] therefore
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:32] for any element N that is <= p (and a and b are one of them)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:36] you have the limit L
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:14:40] that is precisely the join
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:20] hm no
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:22] i don't understand
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:15:26] Why not?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:27] where are "a and b" here
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:33] oh
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:34] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:36] they ar parametrized
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:39] by the diagram you take
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:40] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:41] its ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:42] it works
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:57] thx a lot Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:15:57] :>
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:16:05] no problem :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:16:32] and yes, it commutes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:16:36] because you have only one arrows
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:16:39] yeah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:16:41] so it works
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:17:04] so basically, having all limits in a poset is equivalent to have a unique join and meet
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:17:18] you have a lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:17:22] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:17:36] but it isn't necessarily distributive right ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:17:41] right
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:17:43] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:07] i had another question Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:10] if i understood well
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:13] in a heyting lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:22] a=>b is the greatest element c such that a /\ c <= b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:24] right ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:18:31] yeah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:43] so, if a >= b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:18:49] clearly a=>b = 1
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:19:21] if a < b, c = b ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:19:39] The idea being that you want it to be the most powerful thing that gets you modus ponens
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:20:07] i understand the notation in a boolean lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:20:12] not in heyting algebra
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:20:16] how is that the "most powerful"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:20:45] Think of the object a => b as being "a implies b"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:20:52] and /\ as being "and"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:21:22] We want that from A and (A implies B) that we can infer B
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:21:32] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:21:39] i.e. we want an arrow A /\ (A => B) -> B
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:21:51] what is ->
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:21:58] on the lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:21:59] an arrow in our category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:22:02] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:22:03] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:22:06] so its <=
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:22:09] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:22:30] (though it probably is easier to understand what's going on if you see it as an arrow)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:22:39] (yes, like a "process")
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:22:52] (a "proof")
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:22:58] a => b is meant to be an object which somehow captures the notion that there's an arrow a -> b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:15] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:17] this is false
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:23] if you draw your lattice
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:23:27] In that an arrow 1 -> (a => b) will imply the existence of an arrow a -> b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:27] its easy not to have such arrow
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:33] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:54] so when a=>b = 1
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:23:56] a->b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:24:10] yeah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:24:19] ok i think i'm startng to understand
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:24:23] if a=>b is not 1 you can't conclude
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:24:28] if its 1 then you can
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:24:34] because a=>b is "true"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:24:36] so a-> b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:25:19] Though, if you think in terms of sets, you'd imagine the arrow 1 -> (a => b) as saying that there's a point in the set (a => b), and the existence of such a point will determine a function a -> b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:25:46] But lots of things collapse when we're just working with a Heyting algebra
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:25:58] yes because its intuitionistic
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:26:17] Well, because it's a preorder category :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:26:20] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:27:26] i was wondering
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:27:32] what if i lose distributivity
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:27:37] Oh, I guess I said strongest, from another point of view, it's the weakest proposition for which modus ponens is sound
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:27:58] is there some interpretation of a non distributive lattice in terms of logic ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:28:08] (i.e. it implies the fewest other things)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:16] (ok)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:24] ah, of course yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:27] all the quantum logic stuff
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:35] but you have the strong orthomodularity constraint
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:51] and those logic are bad physically speaking
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:28:57] no dynamics
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:31:46] thx a lot for the help Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:31:51] gonna eat something
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[02:31:51] :>
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[02:31:55] see you around!
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:52:26] Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:52:31] are you still here ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:52:49] i just tried to write properly what we demonstrated
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:53:08] so i find that given the diagram F : J -> P (where P is the complete poset)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:53:32] that is described by the objects p such that a <= p and b <= p
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:53:46] the limit of it exists because P is complete
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:54:04] ah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:54:04] no
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:54:05] its ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:54:08] UMP also gives you existence
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:54:12] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:55:48] so if a \/ b is the limit, then for every other objects q such that the diagram commutes (ie such that there is a "path" from q to all the elements that are greater than both a and b), there EXISTS a unique arrow such that q <= a \/ b
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:55:49] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:55:54] i forgot about the existece
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:55:57] so it works
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:56:07] i was wondering "how do you know that it exists"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:57:05] and of course by duality, if a poset category is cocomplete, it is also complete
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[03:57:06] k
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:05:55] No, you're right, the limit exists because it's a complete category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:06:15] So there's a limit for any diagram we care to choose.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:08:42] yes but i forgot about the existence of the unique morphism
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:08:49] like "you don't know if a and p are comparable"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:08:50] but they are
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:08:52] ah, okay
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:08:53] because of the limit
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:09:08] and basically
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:09:18] there is some arrow that is the identity arrow
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:09:32] from a \/ b and some on your object in the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:10:08] is is specific to "meet" and "join" that the limit of the diagram is an object of the diagram ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:11:14] It always can be
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:11:45] but isnt it in some sense
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:11:48] "equivalent" to a meet or join ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:11:50] algebraically
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:11:54] hm?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:12:01] I don't know
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:12:06] i think this might be true
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:12:20] I mean, it's a limit...
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:12:36] and meets and joins are both examples of limits, as we've seen here
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:12:48] (in a complete poset, anyway)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:12:55] yes, but maybe meet and join are just limit for which the limit is an object contain in the original diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:13:01] algebraically
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:13:32] i don't know if i'm clear
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:13:51] Well, the meet and join are the product and coproduct in a preorder category, if they exist.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:14:02] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:14:26] You can certainly have the limit be an object of the diagram in categories which are not preorder categories
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:15:11] hm i think i have an example but its not really a limit
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:15:11] For example, take the limit of the identity functor on an arbitrary category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:15:17] in a monoidal category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:15:25] This, if it exists, will be an initial object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:15:44] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:15:56] and it's certainly in the diagram, because the diagram is the whole category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:16:00] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:16:16] then maybe
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:16:20] the good proposition is
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:16:51] if the limit of the diagram is ano bject of your diagram, then your object is an initial object of some subcategory
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:16:57] this looks right
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:18:47] I'm not sure that's true :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:18:53] i will try to demonstrate it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:18:53] It's close to being true
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:19:11] looks "more true" than my naive proposition already
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:19:11] ahah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:20:05] Well...
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:20:08] heh
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:20:19] If you just say "some subcategory"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:20:22] then yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:20:28] some full subcategory
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:20:29] but you probably mean something more specific than that
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:20:30] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:20:33] you keep all morphism
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:20:36] all arrows
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:20:40] otherwise its too simple
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:21:17] i think this might be true
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:21:22] i'll try to demonstrate it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:23:35] of a  full subcategory that contains (at least) all the objects of the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:23:39] is that better ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:23:47] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:23:47] no
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:23:57] that doesn't contain ANY objects of the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:24:00] lets try with the complement s
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:24:20] we call completement of a set of object, the subcategory formed by all the other objects
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:24:23] my proposition is
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:24:56] if the limit of the diagram is an object of your diagram, then your object is an initial object of the completement of the objects in the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:25:11] i should try to demonstrate that
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:25:23] Demonstrably not true.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:25:44] Consider 1->2->3->4, and the diagram 2->3.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:25:46] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:25:52] not all objects are comparable
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:25:54] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:26:29] completement such that there exist at least one arrow from the object to your limit object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:26:33] aha
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:26:35] this looks complicated now
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:28:23] so lets call completement of a diagram, the collection of objects that are not inside the diagram and are such that there exists at least one arrow to all the objects of your diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:28:55] proposition : if the limit of the diagram is an object of your diagram, then your limit object is an initial object of the completement of the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:28:57] If you are going to go down the route, you should call it something like the left complement.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:29:05] yes true
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:29:35] this looks to "fit" well with the poset case
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:30:43] imprimable: This kind of thing is hard because the limit's universal property is on the wrong side to guarantee that it has lots of arrows going out of it. We were able to ensure that in the poset case by careful selection of our diagram.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:31:07] But in general, it's not going to happen.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:31:38] i don't know, i feel there's something to say if the limit of a diagram is inside the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:31:56] One thing you can do is look at diagrams of join categories (http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/join+of+categories).
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:32:12] Then given J * J' -> C
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:32:42] ok, thx tomprince
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:32:45] let me check
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:33:05] A limit of J' or a colimit of J fits into a diagram J * 1 * J', and are the terminal and initial category in the category of all such diagrams.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:33:20] (... that are fixed on J and J')
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:33:24] imprimable: You might be able to say this: if the image of the functor has an initial object, and the limit of the functor belongs to the image, then the limit of the functor is the initial object.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:34:28] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:34:34] looks true Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	tomprince	[04:34:51] You need to be careful, since the diagram associated to XxX has an image with an initial object ...
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:35:41] you're giving me the "other side" Cale
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:35:44] the <=
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:37:24] tomprince: Well, yes, but if the limit of that diagram, i.e. X x X, belongs to the diagram itself, then X = X x X.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:38:32] (which, depending on your notion of equality and whether the axiom of choice is around, might be the case whenever X is infinite)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:39:43] Though, I suppose I could also have read that as a categorical product rather than specifically a product of sets :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:42:30] but do you guys agree
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:42:41] that there's certainly somethng to say
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:42:46] if the limit of the diagram is inside it ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:43:37] Well, I said something :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:43:41] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:43:48] but its too weak ,}
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:44:15] what would be nice is some kind of existence property
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:44:23] i dunno, maybe there aren't
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:44:25] but in the case of poset
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:44:36] we prove the existence of "such kind" of initial object
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:44:41] (for complement of diagram)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:44:58] (We really should be saying isomorphic rather than equal)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:45:03] (yes=
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:45:04] )
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:51:57] ok so : let F : J -> C be a diagram that admits a limit in . We call left complement of F, the full subcategory of C generated by the objects that are not contained in the diagram F and such that there exists at least one arrow from those objects to the all the object of the diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:52:41] prop : if F : J->C admits a limit that is contained inside the diagram, then the limit of the diagram is an initial object of the left completement of F
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:52:51] gonna try to prove that if its not too hard
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:52:54] wish me gl
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:52:54] :<<
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:53:37] imprimable: But you just said that the complement consists of objects not in the image of F
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:53:46] So in particular, the limit will not be an object of it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:53:56] So it can't be an initial object of it
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:54:03] "category generated by"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:54:07] i dunno if its correct
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:54:11] What do you mean "generated by"?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:54:46] Usually the category generated by some graph is a category whose objects are the same, and whose arrows consist of all composites of the arrows in that graph.
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:55:17] you also keep the object such that there exist an arrow of codomain (object)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:55:26] whose domain is in the generating "set of object"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:55:31] hmm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:55:39] but you don't keep all their arrows !
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:55:45] you only keep all arrows of the object "outside" them
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:55:51] One thing which is going to be quite hard
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:56:01] Is that in general, we expect the limit to have many automorphisms
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:56:17] and such an object won't be initial
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:56:22] hm
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:56:54] all of this should be understood modulo isomorphism
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:56:56] Unless we restrict which arrows are under discussion
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:57:09] Or many endomorphisms, even
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[04:57:20] (they needn't all even be invertible)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:57:31] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:57:33] so it won't work
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:57:39] it only works because in poset you have only one arrow at max
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[04:57:41] damn
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:00:29] why are we expecting that a limit has many automorphism ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:00:39] because its some kind of "biggest object" ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:01:08] Well, we can't control what arrows it'll have to itself
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:01:14] yes thats true
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:01:14] :<
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:01:45] but one could expect that all the "automorphism" are coded
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:01:49] by isomorphism ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:02:00] you have as many limit isomorphic objects as "automorphism"
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:02:50] Let's take the category with a single object and a single nonidentity arrow, and take a functor from that to some other category, for simplicity, let's take that other category to be a monoid. What does a limit mean in this case?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:03:34] Well, we only have one object to speak of, so the interesting stuff is going to happen with the arrows
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:03:56] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:04:35] a limit means the object itself in your example
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:04:50] Well, there's also an arrow involved
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:05:00] yes, and a unique arrow
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:05:13] and what property will that arrow need to have?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:05:43] not the unique arrow
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:05:46] the other one :)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:05:47] it is the identity
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:05:48] ah
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:05:55] right?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:06:03] Let's give some names to things
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:06:31] if u if the unique arrow from A to A
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:06:32] Let the object of our one-object category be called * and let !: * -> * be the unique nonidentity arrow in that category
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:06:37] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:07:22] then a limit L consists of an object of our monoid (the only one) together with an arrow f: L -> F(*)
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:08:09] such that F(!) . f = f
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:08:11] yes, f is unique, and is such that for all other arrows
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:08:13] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:08:53] why F(!).f and not F(!).f' ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:02] your monoid can have many arrows that makes the daigram commute
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:03] right ?
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:23] wait
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:23] sorry
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:09:24] I'm just staring at the diagram for a limit
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:27] F(!).f = f
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:27] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:29] only the limit diagram
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:09:30] ok
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:10:07] and then for any g such that F(!) . g = g, we have that there is a unique u such that f . u = g
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:10:13] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:10:59] and so yeah, the identity arrow will work, but there might be some others in general
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:11:14] yes you can't conclude that simply
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:11:47] But in any case
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:12:12] The very fact that the limit is in the image of this diagram ensures that it's not initial
2014-02-19 10:46:36	Cale	[05:12:21] because we insisted there's a nonidentity arrow there
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:12:25] yes
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:13:43] yes all teh endomorphisms instanly "break" what i though
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:13:45] you're right
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:14:08] by the way
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:14:18] yesterday, i was wondering if there was a link between the slice category and the exponentials
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:14:58] because A^B can be "interperted" as the arrows from B to A
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:15:24] ie, the category with object such that there is a B in C and A^B exists
2014-02-19 10:46:36	imprimable	[05:15:30] could be related to the slide category over A ?

2014-02-19 23:48:21	imprimable	hi
2014-02-19 23:48:41	imprimable	how can i prove that the evaluation map is unique for an exponential object
2014-02-19 23:48:53	imprimable	i read again, it isnt specify anywhere that it is unique
2014-02-19 23:49:01	imprimable	last time someone told me it has to be
2014-02-19 23:49:49	imprimable	wait nevermind
2014-02-19 23:49:52	imprimable	i know how i think
2014-02-19 23:52:52	imprimable	ok
2014-02-19 23:52:54	imprimable	it works
2014-02-19 23:52:56	imprimable	its indeed unique
2014-02-19 23:57:22	Saizan	care to share the proof?
2014-02-19 23:58:12	imprimable	let epsilon : C^BxB -> C be an exponential of C and B and epsilon the evaluation map
2014-02-19 23:58:35	imprimable	suppose we have a second evaluation map epsilon' : C^BxB -> C that respects the ump
2014-02-19 23:59:03	imprimable	by ump, for all object A, and all map from AxB to C, there exist a unique transpose map tilde(epsilon) such that the diagram commutes
2014-02-19 23:59:12	imprimable	let's chose A = C^B and the map epsilon'
2014-02-19 23:59:33	imprimable	therefore, we have epsilon°tilde(epsilon') = epsilon'
2014-02-19 23:59:47	imprimable	but epsilon' : C^BxB -> C is also an exponential
2014-02-19 23:59:48	imprimable	so by ump
2014-02-20 00:00:18	imprimable	for any object A, and any map AxB -> C, there exists a unique trnaspose map such that the diagrma commute
2014-02-20 00:00:31	imprimable	we take obviously that such map is epsilon with A = C^B
2014-02-20 00:00:50	imprimable	therefore we obtain that epsilon ° tilde(epsilon')° tilde(epsilon) = epsilon
2014-02-20 00:00:55	imprimable	but by unicity of map
2014-02-20 00:01:14	imprimable	clearly, tilde(epsilon')° tilde (epsilon) = tilde (epsilon'°epsilon) = id
2014-02-20 00:01:23	imprimable	and then you use the transpose map
2014-02-20 00:01:24	imprimable	therefore
2014-02-20 00:01:29	imprimable	epsilon'°epsilon =
2014-02-20 00:01:29	imprimable	ah
2014-02-20 00:01:31	imprimable	fuck it
2014-02-20 00:01:34	imprimable	transpose id
2014-02-20 00:01:36	imprimable	hm
2014-02-20 00:01:40	imprimable	h mhm hm
2014-02-20 00:01:41	imprimable	:<
2014-02-20 00:04:37	imprimable	obviously i forgot the identity when i identify the maps but its np
2014-02-20 00:05:23	imprimable	so you can't conclude
2014-02-20 00:05:26	imprimable	that the evaluation map is unique ?
2014-02-20 00:09:49	imprimable	i arrive at
2014-02-20 00:10:04	imprimable	epsilon'°epsilon = inverse tranpose (id_C^B)
2014-02-20 00:10:45	Saizan	what's transpose?
2014-02-20 00:11:08	imprimable	i define tilde : Hom(AxB,C) -> Hom(A, C^B)
2014-02-20 00:11:24	imprimable	it takes the map f to its unique map tilde(f) that makes the diagram commute
2014-02-20 00:11:42	imprimable	you can show that it is invertible
2014-02-20 00:12:00	imprimable	inverse transpose take the unique map and gives the "any map" in the ump

2014-02-20 00:13:37	imprimable	i did a mistake somewhere i think
2014-02-20 00:13:40	imprimable	what is true is
2014-02-20 00:14:02	imprimable	epsilon° (tilde(epsilon') x Id_b) ° (tilde (epsilon)x Id_b) = epsilon
2014-02-20 00:14:12	imprimable	but by uniqueness
2014-02-20 00:16:00	imprimable	(tilde(epsilon') x Id_b) ° (tilde (epsilon) x Id_b) = tilde (epsilon' ° epsilon)xId_b
2014-02-20 00:16:27	imprimable	therefore,  epsilon° tilde (epsilon' ° epsilon)xId_b = epsilon
2014-02-20 00:17:12	imprimable	therefore, tilde (epsilon'°epsilon)x Id_b = Id_(C^BxB), still by uniqueness
2014-02-20 00:17:28	imprimable	but id_(C^BxB) = id_C^B x Id_B
2014-02-20 00:17:31	imprimable	therefore
2014-02-20 00:17:56	imprimable	wait
2014-02-20 00:17:57	imprimable	what did i do
2014-02-20 00:18:49	imprimable	i'm just showing that they are the inverse of each other
2014-02-20 00:19:29	imprimable	therefore
2014-02-20 00:19:39	imprimable	epsilon'°epsilon = tilde (id C^B)
2014-02-20 00:19:43	imprimable	i can't conclude
2014-02-20 00:19:44	imprimable	ah
2014-02-20 00:21:36	imprimable	at least i concluded that they come by pair

2014-02-20 04:13:29	tac	imprimable: not really... but many categories have an object that represents the set of arrows between two other objects
2014-02-20 04:13:57	tac	Hom(A, B) in Sets is the object (set) of all arrows A->B.
2014-02-20 04:15:04	engimo_	imprimable: you may be getting at some sort of higher-categorical structure, e.g. a 2-category is a category such that each pair of elements have a hom-category of maps between them, not just a hom set
2014-02-20 04:15:11	tac	Similarly, in k-Vect, you have the set of all linear maps between two fixed vectorspaces.... you can think of them as matrices, and those obviously form another vectorspace
2014-02-20 04:16:34	imprimable	actually
2014-02-20 04:16:48	imprimable	i was trying to think about how to represent the inference rules of logic with category theory
2014-02-20 04:16:51	imprimable	without extra structure
2014-02-20 04:16:55	imprimable	ie, without being in a CCC
2014-02-20 04:17:06	imprimable	so you would "need" to have a map to map
2014-02-20 04:17:08	imprimable	to code implication
2014-02-20 04:17:45	tac	Well, you've seen the standard way it's done, imprimable
2014-02-20 04:18:03	imprimable	yes but i'm not satisfied
2014-02-20 04:18:04	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-20 04:18:18	tac	That is something we can't really help you with, I'm afraid :<
2014-02-20 04:18:36	imprimable	:<
2014-02-20 04:19:03	imprimable	i was wondering if people tried to generalize
2014-02-20 04:19:07	imprimable	arrow from object to arrow
2014-02-20 04:19:08	imprimable	for example
2014-02-20 04:19:59	tac	Why would you do that?
2014-02-20 04:20:10	tac	You would at least want to turn the arrow into an object
2014-02-20 04:20:17	imprimable	because you can interprete modus ponem
2014-02-20 04:20:24	imprimable	as an arrow from object to arrow
2014-02-20 04:20:33	imprimable	yes thats why you need a "weak" form of object and arrow

2014-02-21 04:09:57	imprimable	i have a question
2014-02-21 04:10:10	imprimable	page 150 awodey's 2nd edition
2014-02-21 04:10:36	<--	joneshf-laptop (~joneshf@128.120.118.58) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2014-02-21 04:11:00	imprimable	it is argued that for a group object G in some random category C, implies that the contravariant representable functor Hom(-, G) is from C^op to Grp
2014-02-21 04:11:13	imprimable	i perfectly understand that if you take the Hom(-,G) to Sets
2014-02-21 04:11:21	imprimable	the group object G can be "translated" to a group object in Sets
2014-02-21 04:11:39	imprimable	but how can i know that such a group object is also part of Grps ?
2014-02-21 04:13:54	Saizan	if you believe that each Hom(c,G) is a set with the structure of a group, isn't that exactly what the objects in Grps are?
2014-02-21 04:14:27	imprimable	well i believe it has to be isomorphic to some object there
2014-02-21 04:14:29	imprimable	but be inside ?
2014-02-21 04:14:29	imprimable	no
2014-02-21 04:14:32	imprimable	its a different objet
2014-02-21 04:14:43	imprimable	objets in Grps are sets with binary relations such that ...
2014-02-21 04:14:56	imprimable	a group object in Sets is a set + 3 maps
2014-02-21 04:15:39	imprimable	so rigorously speaking
2014-02-21 04:15:41	Saizan	well, there's a simple conversion i guess
2014-02-21 04:15:51	imprimable	the group object in Set doesn't belong to Grps right ?
2014-02-21 04:16:00	imprimable	even though it is isomorphic to some object there
2014-02-21 04:17:03	Saizan	yeah, i guess to be very precise it doesn't
2014-02-21 04:17:30	imprimable	maybe i attach too mch importance to differencate "group object" and object from Grp ?
2014-02-21 04:17:32	Saizan	but i saying this without looking at the context
2014-02-21 04:18:04	Saizan	i haven't seen the definition of Grps
2014-02-21 04:18:21	Saizan	but i'd think objects there are pretty much the group objects in Set?
2014-02-21 04:18:28	imprimable	i don't know
2014-02-21 04:18:36	imprimable	group object in Grps are abelian groups for example
2014-02-21 04:18:38	imprimable	so its not trivial
2014-02-21 04:20:00	Saizan	i didn't mean that the categories are the same
2014-02-21 04:23:34	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-21 04:26:37	imprimable	if i understand well teh construction in the book
2014-02-21 04:26:43	imprimable	you have a category C
2014-02-21 04:27:07	imprimable	there inside, one can find some "algebraic object" (like group objet, ring object, ...) G
2014-02-21 04:27:11	imprimable	and the important point
2014-02-21 04:27:29	imprimable	is that for any other object of C that is not necessarily an "algebraic object" in the previous sense
2014-02-21 04:27:59	imprimable	Hom(-,G)(X) can be defined as an "algebraic object" of the same type of object as in G
2014-02-21 04:28:25	imprimable	and Hom(-,G)(f) where f is some arrows in C automatically acquire the good property (morphism ofgroup, of ring ...)
2014-02-21 04:28:37	imprimable	is that true or i didn't understand something ?
2014-02-21 04:29:14	imprimable	i find it weird to identify a group object in Sets with an object in Grps
2014-02-21 04:29:31	Saizan	why?
2014-02-21 04:30:07	imprimable	well i dunno, the representable functor is in Sets to me
2014-02-21 04:30:12	imprimable	you have to define a new one
2014-02-21 04:30:19	imprimable	by composing with an isomorphic functor
2014-02-21 04:30:20	imprimable	i guess
2014-02-21 04:30:26	imprimable	so you have to prove that such functor exists
2014-02-21 04:30:39	imprimable	from your group object in Sets to an object in Grp
2014-02-21 04:30:41	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-21 04:31:21	Saizan	well, i see it more like this:
2014-02-21 04:31:39	Saizan	an object in Grp is a set equipped with some structure
2014-02-21 04:32:03	Saizan	Hom(-,G) produces sets for which we know how to build that exact structure
2014-02-21 04:32:50	imprimable	well
2014-02-21 04:32:51	Saizan	so, yeah, it's a bit of abuse to say Hom(-,G) : C -> Grps, but not much
2014-02-21 04:32:56	imprimable	what does it means "we know how to build"
2014-02-21 04:33:05	imprimable	i'm sorry but "we know how to build" is precisely a functor
2014-02-21 04:33:07	imprimable	from Sets to Grps
2014-02-21 04:33:20	Saizan	it can't be a functor Sets -> Grps
2014-02-21 04:33:40	Saizan	at best it's a functor (subcategory of group objects of Sets) -> Grps
2014-02-21 04:33:56	imprimable	yes
2014-02-21 04:34:02	imprimable	but you see what i mean
2014-02-21 04:34:14	Saizan	so then you'd have to think of Hom(-,G) : C -> (subcategory of group objects of Sets) rather than C -> Sets
2014-02-21 04:34:18	imprimable	why should i believe that every group object is in Grp ?
2014-02-21 04:34:41	Saizan	so you'd still have the problem that the types don't match :)
2014-02-21 04:34:44	imprimable	i mean, i "understand" it, but i can't prove it
2014-02-21 04:35:04	Saizan	it's something you prove at the meta-level, i'd say
2014-02-21 04:35:29	imprimable	what's the meta levl
2014-02-21 04:36:41	Saizan	well, i mean by unpacking the definitions of Grps and group object in Sets, rather than building a functor
2014-02-21 04:37:08	imprimable	i'm going to try to prove it from the category of Grp objects in Sets
2014-02-21 04:37:12	imprimable	group objects sorry
2014-02-21 04:37:28	imprimable	let me first check that this indeed forms a category firt
2014-02-21 04:37:29	imprimable	:>
2014-02-21 04:38:37	imprimable	ok so, a morphism of group objects in Set would be a map f
2014-02-21 04:38:39	imprimable	such that
2014-02-21 04:38:56	imprimable	f°m1 = m2°(fxf)
2014-02-21 04:39:34	imprimable	u2 f = f°u1 where u is the identity
2014-02-21 04:39:38	imprimable	and for inverse i suppose the same
2014-02-21 04:39:39	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-21 04:40:09	imprimable	if f = Id_G where (G,m,u,i) is such a group object
2014-02-21 04:40:44	imprimable	it works
2014-02-21 04:40:54	Saizan	no, a morphism would just be a function between the sets
2014-02-21 04:40:56	imprimable	so Id_G is indeed a unite in the category of group object
2014-02-21 04:41:12	imprimable	well yes
2014-02-21 04:41:20	imprimable	but it has to respect the algebraic maps
2014-02-21 04:41:32	imprimable	f is indeed just a function in Sets
2014-02-21 04:41:35	imprimable	such that ...
2014-02-21 04:41:48	imprimable	indeed if f is the identity on G a group object in Sets
2014-02-21 04:41:48	Saizan	well, i guess you can pick it that way, i was just thinking of the category you get by restricting the objects
2014-02-21 04:41:55	Saizan	but keeping all the functions
2014-02-21 04:41:56	imprimable	f is indeed an identity in the category of group object
2014-02-21 04:42:04	imprimable	hm
2014-02-21 04:42:06	imprimable	i would say
2014-02-21 04:42:20	imprimable	the category of group object in Sets is not in Set
2014-02-21 04:42:25	imprimable	objects are (G, m, u, i)
2014-02-21 04:42:30	imprimable	where m : GxG -> G
2014-02-21 04:42:40	imprimable	u : G-> G
2014-02-21 04:42:44	imprimable	i : G -> G inverse map
2014-02-21 04:42:46	imprimable	u unit
2014-02-21 04:42:46	Saizan	but yours works better if you want a functor into Grps :)
2014-02-21 04:42:50	imprimable	yes
2014-02-21 04:42:58	imprimable	i need to show associativity now
2014-02-21 04:42:59	imprimable	i have unit
2014-02-21 04:43:37	imprimable	so suppose we have three group object (G, m1, u1, i1), (H, m2, u2, i2), (K, m3", u3, i3)
2014-02-21 04:43:59	imprimable	and two morphism of group object in Sets, that is, simple map f : G -> H and g : H -> k
2014-02-21 04:44:03	imprimable	such that
2014-02-21 04:44:50	imprimable	f°m1 = m2°(fxf), u2°f = f°u1, i2°f = f°i1;   g°m2 = m3°(gxg), u3°f = f°u2, and i3°f = f°u2
2014-02-21 04:45:16	imprimable	and we need to show that f°g in Arrow(Sets) is indeed an arrow in the category of group objects in Sets
2014-02-21 04:45:29	imprimable	so
2014-02-21 04:45:35	imprimable	g°f sorry
2014-02-21 04:46:01	imprimable	g°f°m1 = g°m2(fxf) = m3(g°fxg°f)
2014-02-21 04:46:02	imprimable	and so on
2014-02-21 04:46:04	imprimable	i guess it works trivially
2014-02-21 04:46:05	imprimable	so ok
2014-02-21 04:46:06	imprimable	ineded
2014-02-21 04:46:15	imprimable	the category of group objects of some category C is indeed a category
2014-02-21 04:46:21	imprimable	so we can construct a functor from such category to Grps
2014-02-21 04:46:27	imprimable	now
2014-02-21 04:46:45	imprimable	how can we show that our objects there are isomorphic to a subcategory of Grps ?
2014-02-21 04:49:19	imprimable	anyone can help me ?
2014-02-21 04:50:03	Saizan	write a functor froms that to Grps and back and show their composition is the identity?
2014-02-21 04:50:35	imprimable	suppose i can do that
2014-02-21 04:50:46	imprimable	i then have a fnctor from the category of group objects of Sets to Grp
2014-02-21 04:50:52	imprimable	lets call it F
2014-02-21 04:51:10	imprimable	i have my representable functor Hom(-,G) : C -> Sets
2014-02-21 04:51:18	imprimable	where G is a group object in C
2014-02-21 04:51:50	imprimable	i need the functor from Sets  -> category of group object of Sets
2014-02-21 04:52:04	imprimable	how can i do that
2014-02-21 04:52:17	Saizan	i don't think there's one
2014-02-21 04:52:20	imprimable	where should i send all the sets that are not group object in set ?
2014-02-21 04:53:08	imprimable	well then
2014-02-21 04:53:11	imprimable	teh result is false

2014-02-21 05:06:39	Saizan	take apart the pieces of Hom(-,G) : C^op -> Sets and piece them together a bit differently to get Hom(-,G) : C^op -> Grps
2014-02-21 05:07:00	imprimable	how ?
2014-02-21 05:07:09	imprimable	i don't understand how i can do that
2014-02-21 05:07:14	imprimable	G is a group object
2014-02-21 05:07:22	imprimable	which means it is (G,m, u, i) that is a group
2014-02-21 05:07:29	imprimable	in C^op
2014-02-21 05:07:58	imprimable	and functoriality allows me to construct a group object in Sets

2014-02-21 05:08:20	imprimable	this doesn't make sense

2014-02-21 05:08:31	imprimable	i can see that Hom(c,G) is indeed a group object

2014-02-21 05:21:18	imprimable	well i think there's a problem actually
2014-02-21 05:22:12	imprimable	i don't understand how you can turn a group object in Sets to a object in Grp
2014-02-21 05:22:31	imprimable	because a group object is an object + 3 maps
2014-02-21 05:22:49	imprimable	so i constructed the category of group object in Sets, i showed it was indeed a actegory

2014-02-22 09:54:40	cads	We recall that a classical relation r : A -> B can be represented by an binary indexed partition r_i of AxB. A relation r: A -> B in my category similarly is represented by a 4 element indexed partition r_i of AxB.
2014-02-22 09:56:57	cads	The idea is that a classical relation partitions entries into classes "related" and "not related"

2014-02-22 09:58:59	cads	While this extended relation partitions entries into "known related", "known not related", "contradictory knowledge", "unknown".
2014-02-22 10:02:51	cads	the neat thing is that this extended scheme embeds to classical relations - a classical relation can represented uniquely by an extended relation with no entries in its third and fourth partitions.

2014-02-24 04:44:25	imprimable	i have a question
2014-02-24 04:46:24	imprimable	do you think that i can understand  http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/ttt.html on topos theory if i only know CT from awodey's book ?

2014-02-24 05:01:57	tomprince	imprimable: Why don't you try it and see. I found that when I was learning things, trying to read stuff that was beyond where I was at the time helped me to understand more basic stuff that I had been struggling with.
2014-02-24 05:02:11	imprimable	hm, thats true tomprince
2014-02-24 05:03:33	imprimable	so i guess i'll try once i'm over with awodey
2014-02-24 05:03:39	imprimable	and we'll see :>
2014-02-24 05:05:59	tomprince	imprimable: Why not start now?
2014-02-24 05:06:36	imprimable	because i want to finish awodey first
2014-02-24 05:06:55	imprimable	i don't understnad yet what is an adjoint functor (i only understand it in the case of poset, ie, galois connection)
2014-02-24 05:06:57	imprimable	neither a monad

2014-02-24 05:35:23	tomprince	I found that seeing examples being used helped me understand what those were.
2014-02-24 05:36:08	imprimable	the concept of adjunction looks hard a priori so yes
2014-02-24 05:36:19	imprimable	i will try to understand it with example before i try the other book :>
2014-02-24 05:37:54	tomprince	imprimable: I'm suggesting that you will find example by reading the other book.
2014-02-24 05:38:16	imprimable	oh
2014-02-24 05:38:29	imprimable	i need to do all the exercices from awodey first
2014-02-24 05:38:34	imprimable	i jumped many of them
2014-02-24 05:38:34	tomprince	Why?
2014-02-24 05:38:45	imprimable	to be better at manipulating thing
2014-02-24 05:38:46	imprimable	s
2014-02-24 05:38:47	tomprince	I'm not saying you shouldn't do them, but why *First*.
2014-02-24 05:38:54	imprimable	well i dunno
2014-02-24 05:39:07	imprimable	i feel its "logic" to understand well CT rudiment
2014-02-24 05:39:10	imprimable	and THEN go for topos theory ?
2014-02-24 05:39:24	imprimable	i would feel i'm rushing too muhc otherwise
2014-02-24 05:40:29	tomprince	too much for what?
2014-02-24 05:40:37	imprimable	to understand those things
2014-02-24 05:40:53	tomprince	It is sometimes useful to rush ahead, and the come back and look at the things you rushed by.
2014-02-24 05:41:03	imprimable	thats true too
2014-02-24 05:42:25	tomprince	Sometimes it helps to see where one is going, when trying to understand details.
2014-02-24 05:43:48	imprimable	i feel i'm still too weak in manipulating things on explicite example yet
2014-02-24 05:43:53	imprimable	i need to do more exercices :>
2014-02-24 05:44:28	tomprince	Well, do that *too*, but you show start reading TTT *now*.
2014-02-24 05:44:37	imprimable	ahah why
2014-02-24 05:44:47	imprimable	why do you want me to start right now ? i'm noly page 180 of awodey
2014-02-24 05:44:48	tomprince	As in, minimize your IRC client and open Barr-Wells.
2014-02-24 05:44:50	imprimable	and theer are 300
2014-02-24 05:44:50	imprimable	:<
2014-02-24 05:44:52	tomprince	Why not.
2014-02-24 05:45:28	imprimable	i dunno, i want to finish awodey first
2014-02-24 05:45:29	tomprince	I think you'll find awodey easier to understand, having tried to read barr-wells.
2014-02-24 05:46:31	tomprince	imprimable: Have you looked at the table of contents of TTT?
2014-02-24 05:46:35	imprimable	yes i did
2014-02-24 05:46:48	imprimable	first chapter treats CT
2014-02-24 05:46:50	imprimable	but i wanted to skip it
2014-02-24 05:46:51	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-24 05:46:56	imprimable	(but filtered limit)
2014-02-24 05:48:26	tomprince	Also "What is expected from the reader" from the preface.
2014-02-24 05:48:35	imprimable	yes i did too
2014-02-24 05:49:10	tomprince	imprimable: What can trying to read it hurt?
2014-02-24 05:49:23	imprimable	i feel its not doing things in the correct order
2014-02-24 05:49:26	imprimable	i don't know
2014-02-24 05:49:35	imprimable	i don't have infinite time either
2014-02-24 05:49:40	imprimable	its "more effective" to finish one thing
2014-02-24 05:49:43	imprimable	then start another thing
2014-02-24 05:49:47	imprimable	than two in parallele
2014-02-24 05:49:57	tomprince	My experience with learning mathematics is the opposite.
2014-02-24 05:50:09	imprimable	hm
2014-02-24 05:50:19	imprimable	i never worked this way in maths
2014-02-24 05:50:22	tomprince	I often found that I didn't understand one thing properly until I had gone on to try to understand the next.
2014-02-24 05:50:24	imprimable	maybe its bad :>
2014-02-24 05:50:48	tomprince	I'm not saying that. I'm just suggesting you try something new.
2014-02-24 05:51:08	tomprince	Maybe it won't work for you; I only have my experience to go on.
2014-02-24 05:51:40	imprimable	so if i start with barr-wells
2014-02-24 05:51:46	imprimable	should i do first chapter too ?
2014-02-24 05:52:18	tomprince	But, you do seemto be placing a large empahsis on understanding one thing before proceeding to the next. But I think you won't be able to measure your understanding until you go on.
2014-02-24 05:52:46	tomprince	imprimable: How about the summary of topics in the preface, then chapter 2.
2014-02-24 05:52:47	imprimable	you're right, sometimes its good to "go on" and understand better by looking back
2014-02-24 05:53:14	imprimable	but i rarely do that
2014-02-24 05:53:23	imprimable	i feel its not done in the correct order :<
2014-02-24 05:54:06	tomprince	It isn't like somebody is going to come and punish you if you do something in the "incorrect" order.
2014-02-24 05:54:12	imprimable	ahah yes
2014-02-24 05:56:08	imprimable	but i fear that if i do two things in parallel
2014-02-24 05:56:11	imprimable	i will do both badly
2014-02-24 05:56:11	imprimable	:>
2014-02-24 05:57:08	<--	tel (~tel@65.242.50.26) has quit (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2014-02-24 05:57:25	tomprince	You don't know unless you try. And if it it turns out that that is the case, you can always go back to doing just one.
2014-02-24 05:57:41	imprimable	true
2014-02-24 05:58:03	imprimable	do you know this barr and wells tomprince ?
2014-02-24 05:58:10	imprimable	it looks quite good (by looking at the index)
2014-02-24 05:58:28	tomprince	I'm sure I've read bits and pieces at some point, but not recently.
2014-02-24 05:59:00	imprimable	i will try what you propose
2014-02-24 05:59:04	imprimable	3 days awodey
2014-02-24 05:59:07	imprimable	3 days barr and wells
2014-02-24 05:59:26	imprimable	and i will start from chapter 1 barr and wells
2014-02-24 05:59:33	imprimable	so i can be introduced to adjunction there first
2014-02-24 05:59:34	imprimable	then awodey
2014-02-24 05:59:44	tomprince	You should try starting with chpater 2 of barr/wells.
2014-02-24 05:59:52	imprimable	without knowing adjunction ? :
2014-02-24 05:59:53	imprimable	:<
2014-02-24 06:00:12	tomprince	I'm not sure if Barr/wells does this, but I know other books suggest skipping the first chapter, and only refereing back to it when necessary.
2014-02-24 06:00:42	imprimable	ok
2014-02-24 06:00:45	imprimable	i'll do that then
2014-02-24 06:01:02	imprimable	what about johnstone book
2014-02-24 06:01:04	imprimable	"Topos theory" ?
2014-02-24 06:01:08	imprimable	too hard maybe ?
2014-02-24 06:01:15	tomprince	imprimable: It sounds like you know adjunction, but don't yet understand it. I'm not sure if you can understand it just by thinking about it more, but I suspect that seeing example *in context* is one of the better ways of learning about them.
2014-02-24 06:01:31	imprimable	i only know it from galois connection
2014-02-24 06:01:36	imprimable	i understood what it means there but that it
2014-02-24 06:03:03	tomprince	johnsone's book is rather dense, but I'd say go ahead and try and dive into it.
2014-02-24 06:03:24	tomprince	MacLane and Moerdijk book is good too.
2014-02-24 06:04:13	imprimable	i think i will stick to barr and wells
2014-02-24 06:04:19	imprimable	it looks quite good (in index at least)
2014-02-24 06:04:25	imprimable	and not too dense/difficult for me

2014-02-25 06:01:14	imprimable	oh
2014-02-25 06:01:16	imprimable	my definition is
2014-02-25 06:02:00	imprimable	for B a boolean algebra, a filter on U is a subalgebra of B such that for all x,y, in U, x/\b is in U
2014-02-25 06:02:11	imprimable	and for all x in U, all y in B, x <= y => y in U
2014-02-25 06:02:23	imprimable	and an ultra filter is just a maximal filter on B
2014-02-25 06:02:32	imprimable	ie, if you any other filter that strictly contains it = B
2014-02-25 06:03:49	Cale	Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're not going to get that this is a constructively decidable thing

2014-02-25 06:06:30	Cale	Right, because you might not have that for all x, x in U or x not in U.
2014-02-25 06:06:33	imprimable	maybe one can use the isomorphism Ult(B) =~ Hom(B,2) ?

2014-02-25 06:08:19	imprimable	or maybe i didn't do the part "both" constructively

2014-02-25 06:09:53	imprimable	and i guess i'm cheating too
2014-02-25 06:09:59	imprimable	because you need such result to show the isomorphism
2014-02-25 06:10:10	imprimable	i dunno if you can obtain it without it
2014-02-25 06:13:03	imprimable	i guess i should stop tryng to find constructive proof
2014-02-25 06:13:10	imprimable	when its trivial without being constructive
2014-02-25 06:13:11	imprimable	:<<
2014-02-25 06:15:29	Cale	imprimable: Well, in a constructive setting, it would break down to whether membership in the ultrafilter is a decidable property
2014-02-25 06:16:06	imprimable	do you know if it is ?
2014-02-25 06:16:24	Cale	and that doesn't come for free, you'd need to rely on the precise fashion in which the ultrafilter and its underlying set are constructed
2014-02-25 06:16:32	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 06:16:43	Cale	You could insist on it though, in your definition of an ultrafilter
2014-02-25 06:16:51	Cale	depending on what your goals were
2014-02-25 06:17:25	imprimable	maybe you can help me Cale
2014-02-25 06:17:34	imprimable	i was asking myself a question on decidability
2014-02-25 06:17:43	imprimable	but not even on intuitionism
2014-02-25 06:17:46	imprimable	you can keep to classical logic

2014-02-25 06:18:10	imprimable	and let Dec(A) be the proposition : there exist a proof of A or there exist a proof of non A
2014-02-25 06:18:22	imprimable	does it exist some A such that DecDec(A) is false ?
2014-02-25 06:18:34	imprimable	does it exist such A such that for all n, Dec....Dec(A) is false ?
2014-02-25 06:18:38	imprimable	(ie, infinite undecidability)
2014-02-25 06:18:48	imprimable	i tried to do some diagonal argument for the latter, couldn't succeed
2014-02-25 06:21:34	--	[mth]_away is now known as [mth]
2014-02-25 06:21:46	Cale	I don't know of anything off-hand for the Dec(Dec(A)) case, but I don't think the infinite case makes sense, unless your ambient logic is very powerful compared to the one you're studying.
2014-02-25 06:22:01	imprimable	hm
2014-02-25 06:22:06	imprimable	you think you can't find a fixed point ?
2014-02-25 06:22:14	imprimable	i have the intuition you can
2014-02-25 06:22:20	imprimable	its just a diagonal argument i'm sure
2014-02-25 06:22:24	ystael	I don't even understand how that makes sense -- isn't Dec(A) a metatheoretic statement, not one internal to the logic that contains A?
2014-02-25 06:22:26	Cale	(and you're not talking about proofs in a formalisation of the same system...)
2014-02-25 06:22:38	imprimable	i don't know ystael
2014-02-25 06:22:40	imprimable	i do that "intuitively"
2014-02-25 06:22:43	Cale	Yeah, you need a way to internalise Dec
2014-02-25 06:22:47	imprimable	i see
2014-02-25 06:22:51	imprimable	i need to code "Dec" in my logic
2014-02-25 06:24:01	ystael	I mean, you could say DecDec A := (A + ~A) + ~(A + ~A) and so on but that seems not so useful
2014-02-25 06:24:02	Cale	But in any case, if it's meant to be the same logic, you could just examine the n+1 case to see that the nth wasn't actually decidable, and so in particular, it can't be false.
2014-02-25 06:24:03	tac	I might be mistaken, but I think Dec^3 might get you an answer
2014-02-25 06:24:29	tac	Eventually, you hit a point (I think) where you get ~(... + ~~(A + ~A) + ...)
2014-02-25 06:24:35	imprimable	ystael: yes with ecluded middle
2014-02-25 06:24:37	imprimable	its related to it

2014-02-25 06:33:22	imprimable	you can't conclude on Dec (n times) (A) with Dec (mtimes) A
2014-02-25 06:33:23	imprimable	for m =/= n
2014-02-25 06:33:28	imprimable	and so on
2014-02-25 06:38:34	imprimable	i'm convinced there's a fixed point
2014-02-25 06:38:36	imprimable	but i can't find it
2014-02-25 06:38:51	Cale	tac: Well, playing with it in Coq, I don't think I can get a proof of Dec (Dec (Dec A)). The initial goal looks like: A + Not A + Not (A + Not A) + Not (A + Not A + Not (A + Not A)), and all we have is that A is a type. So, the first two of those summands are hopeless, because we haven't enough information, the third is outright refutable, and so if there's any hope, it's with the last one
2014-02-25 06:39:11	Cale	so I apply inr, and now I'm trying to show that  Not (A + Not A + Not (A + Not A))
2014-02-25 06:39:39	Cale	or equivalently, that from the hypothesis A + Not A + Not (A + Not A), we can get False
2014-02-25 06:39:54	Cale	But in order to do that, I have to deal with the case that the hypothesis is just A.
2014-02-25 06:41:06	tac	Cale: I tried it on Djinn... I don't think it's provable, either
2014-02-25 06:41:36	tac	Cale: But what about the third iteration? I think you might be able to show that by Godel Gentzen
2014-02-25 06:41:46	Cale	That was the third iteration?
2014-02-25 06:41:50	Cale	or you mean the next one?
2014-02-25 06:42:19	tac	Dec (Dec (Dec A))
2014-02-25 06:42:29	Cale	yeah, that's what that was
2014-02-25 06:42:34	tac	oh
2014-02-25 06:42:35	tac	ahh
2014-02-25 06:42:37	tac	I missed that
2014-02-25 06:43:45	imprimable	don't you think it might be ""easier""
2014-02-25 06:43:46	Cale	If you've decided that the first n-1 iterations can't be done, then in the nth iteration you'll always end up in a place in your proof where you want to show  (A + ...) -> False
2014-02-25 06:43:47	imprimable	to find a fixed point ?
2014-02-25 06:43:58	Cale	and so you're out of luck
2014-02-25 06:44:29	Cale	imprimable: What do you mean by a fixed point?
2014-02-25 06:44:35	Cale	A fixed point of Dec?
2014-02-25 06:44:38	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 06:44:40	imprimable	so you can go to infinity
2014-02-25 06:44:46	imprimable	and it is "infinitely undecidable"
2014-02-25 06:45:28	imprimable	there might be some diagonal argument that exists
2014-02-25 06:45:32	imprimable	to find such fixed point
2014-02-25 06:45:34	imprimable	i'm sure it exist
2014-02-25 06:45:35	imprimable	s
2014-02-25 06:45:49	imprimable	but i don't even know if there are some known proposition A such that DecDec(A) is false

2014-02-25 06:55:03	Cale	imprimable: But I suppose one could see that in HoTT, if A is contractible, then Dec(A) is contractible, and so we'd have A = Dec(A) then, so the trivially true statement is a fixpoint of Dec.

2014-02-25 12:45:33	tac	ReinH: A const monoid? You mean like ({c}, const, c)?
2014-02-25 12:45:47	ReinH	in Haskell terms, Monoid a => Monoid (Const a b)
2014-02-25 12:45:53	ReinH	so Const 1 is a "tally" monoid
2014-02-25 12:45:57	tac	with const being const : C x C -> C, of course and C = {c}
2014-02-25 12:46:20	tac	ah
2014-02-25 12:46:20	ReinH	so (Sum, Const 1) is one way to get a Mean monoid
2014-02-25 12:46:32	ReinH	sorry, (Sum, Const (Sum 1))
2014-02-25 12:46:33	tac	Well Const a b = a
2014-02-25 12:46:37	ReinH	er yeah
2014-02-25 12:46:41	tac	So your underlying set is just a
2014-02-25 12:46:56	ReinH	but how do I describe the binary op?
2014-02-25 12:47:10	tac	and for x y in a, xy is just the xy of the underlying monoid a

2014-02-25 12:47:53	tac	Mathematically, it's kind of dumb, because the monoid for Const a b and the monoid for a are equal

2014-02-25 12:48:09	tac	(or at least, canonically isomorphic)
2014-02-25 12:48:44	ReinH	tac: basically what I want to do is list some monoids and say, e.g., Sum = <Int, +, 0>; Product = <Int, *, 1>; Const n = <Int, ??, ??>
2014-02-25 12:48:55	ReinH	maybe I should just stop trying to do that

2014-02-25 12:49:09	tac	heh

2014-02-25 12:49:37	ReinH	Well, I really want to use the count monoid
2014-02-25 12:49:47	ReinH	I mean, I'm talking about the bloom filter monoid
2014-02-25 12:49:55	ReinH	so I'm decidedly not sticking to familiar examples :p
2014-02-25 12:49:58	tac	ah
2014-02-25 12:50:03	ReinH	but I don't attempt to define it as a tuple
2014-02-25 12:50:08	tac	So it just counts?
2014-02-25 12:50:12	ReinH	I just wave my hands really fast
2014-02-25 12:50:16	ReinH	yep
2014-02-25 12:50:42	tac	The problem is you have to combine elements from the underlying set
2014-02-25 12:50:55	tac	So if your underlying set is the naturals (your counter)
2014-02-25 12:51:09	tac	then you're combining naturals together, and not more interesting things.
2014-02-25 12:51:25	tac	If you want to combine more interesting things, you would want to use a free monoid (lists)
2014-02-25 12:51:42	tac	or maybe something convoluted.... like (int, list of type thing)
2014-02-25 12:51:47	tac	where the int is the length of the list
2014-02-25 12:52:27	ReinH	tac: right, it's a free monoid morphism in this case

2014-02-25 21:59:41	Cale	imprimable: Well, that's what lets you apply the associator a bunch of times to get between any two associations of a tensored sequence of objects without worrying about whether that's the same as some other way to do it.
2014-02-25 22:00:23	imprimable	but why isn't it enough to impose the natural isomorphism to have that ?
2014-02-25 22:00:26	imprimable	i don't understand
2014-02-25 22:00:34	imprimable	if it is naturally isomorphic, then you're done right ?
2014-02-25 22:01:15	mr-	imprimable: there are two answers: Firstly, it fits the examples, secondly, having that axiom ensures that everything (that is written down by tensoring, using the associators and units) commutes
2014-02-25 22:01:20	Cale	Well, you already know that all the objects in the pentagon diagram are isomorphic, all the arrows in it are isomorphism
2014-02-25 22:01:20	Cale	s
2014-02-25 22:01:39	Cale	The coherence is saying that certain composites of isomorphisms are equal
2014-02-25 22:01:41	mr-	I believe that's Mac Lane's Coherence Theorem, or somethign
2014-02-25 22:03:03	imprimable	let me think a bit
2014-02-25 22:03:11	imprimable	i think i misunderstands why it doesn't hold automatically
2014-02-25 22:03:58	Cale	If these things are just sets, then the isomorphisms are bijections. It's not necessarily the case that two bijections are equal.
2014-02-25 22:04:07	imprimable	ok
2014-02-25 22:04:09	imprimable	i got it
2014-02-25 22:04:15	imprimable	so you want that composing only to the left and only to the right
2014-02-25 22:04:17	imprimable	is the same thing
2014-02-25 22:04:19	imprimable	thats it ?
2014-02-25 22:04:22	mr-	yes
2014-02-25 22:04:24	imprimable	yes ok
2014-02-25 22:04:25	imprimable	i see
2014-02-25 22:04:33	mr-	That is what is meant by "commuting"
2014-02-25 22:04:40	imprimable	why is it enough to have it only for 4
2014-02-25 22:04:42	imprimable	and not all objects
2014-02-25 22:04:49	mr-	That's a theorem
2014-02-25 22:04:54	imprimable	ok
2014-02-25 22:05:03	Cale	Not only that they're the same, but that applying the associator isomorphisms to get from one to the other in different ways will end up producing the same resuly
2014-02-25 22:05:04	mr-	Feel free to investigate, but I can't tell you :-)
2014-02-25 22:05:05	imprimable	otherwise you would need to have it for all objects
2014-02-25 22:05:05	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-25 22:05:05	Cale	t*
2014-02-25 22:05:41	Cale	Yeah, you'd probably want to insist on something stronger if MacLane's coherence theorem didn't hold
2014-02-25 22:05:50	imprimable	i understand thx
2014-02-25 22:05:52	imprimable	another question
2014-02-25 22:05:55	mr-	imprimable: The theorem is, that these diagrams imply that anything you can write down using tensors, the associators and units, will commute
2014-02-25 22:06:01	imprimable	why do we use an object I and not an ident map to code the unit ?
2014-02-25 22:06:26	Cale	imprimable: How would it be an identity map? That's not an object...
2014-02-25 22:06:27	imprimable	if a strict monoidal category is a monoid in Cat
2014-02-25 22:06:36	imprimable	i would use an ident map
2014-02-25 22:06:39	Cale	At least, not in general?
2014-02-25 22:06:43	imprimable	as for group object
2014-02-25 22:07:05	Cale	Consider the case of (Set, Cartesian product, {*})
2014-02-25 22:07:27	Cale	i.e. the one element set is the "I" in that case
2014-02-25 22:07:40	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 22:08:01	imprimable	but you could also introduce a map "i"
2014-02-25 22:08:11	imprimable	that goes from C -> CxC via <id,i>
2014-02-25 22:08:15	imprimable	then compose with (x)
2014-02-25 22:08:33	imprimable	impose that it is equal with m°(<i,id>)
2014-02-25 22:08:36	imprimable	and equal to id
2014-02-25 22:08:36	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-25 22:08:44	imprimable	(where id is the identity functor)
2014-02-25 22:09:01	Cale	i is a functor C -> C?
2014-02-25 22:09:04	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 22:09:07	imprimable	the "ident functor"
2014-02-25 22:09:15	imprimable	that sends any element to the object "I"
2014-02-25 22:09:27	Cale	Oh, that's confusing terminology
2014-02-25 22:09:35	imprimable	like, if you have an initial category 1
2014-02-25 22:09:38	imprimable	it would be
2014-02-25 22:09:41	imprimable	i : C->1->C
2014-02-25 22:09:45	imprimable	you see ?
2014-02-25 22:09:48	Cale	You mean the constant I functor
2014-02-25 22:10:08	Cale	You could talk about things that way
2014-02-25 22:10:17	imprimable	hm yes
2014-02-25 22:10:17	imprimable	the constant I functor
2014-02-25 22:10:17	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 22:10:17	imprimable	sorry for terminology
2014-02-25 22:10:25	Cale	It's just more straightforward to pick an object rather than a constant functor
2014-02-25 22:10:33	imprimable	i don't feel so
2014-02-25 22:10:42	imprimable	if a monoidal category is an monoidal object in Cat
2014-02-25 22:10:44	Cale	A constant functor picks an object anyhow
2014-02-25 22:10:55	imprimable	it would be better to have a constant I functor rather than an object
2014-02-25 22:11:07	mr-	It's the same?
2014-02-25 22:11:19	imprimable	well the definition would be more elegant with cosntant I functor
2014-02-25 22:11:24	imprimable	more symmetric with the rest
2014-02-25 22:12:14	imprimable	i guess its an historical "mistake" ?

2014-02-25 22:12:26	Cale	I don't see this as a mistake?
2014-02-25 22:12:39	imprimable	hm, lets say, bad terminology ?
2014-02-25 22:12:40	imprimable	:>
2014-02-25 22:12:42	mr-	I guess it depends on what definition you are looking at..
2014-02-25 22:12:46	Cale	It's either equivalent to what you're saying, or there's some kind of misunderstanding
2014-02-25 22:12:51	Cale	Well, also you wouldn't be picking a functor C -> C, you'd want a functor 1 -> C where 1 is the terminal category.
2014-02-25 22:12:53	imprimable	yes it is equivalent
2014-02-25 22:13:19	imprimable	but i don't know why for monoidal category they insist on the object rather than on the "internal monoid object"
2014-02-25 22:13:26	imprimable	but yes, its equivalent
2014-02-25 22:13:28	Cale	However, if you *can* talk about objects of C, you might as well
2014-02-25 22:14:23	Cale	The reason that the definition monoid object has to speak of a map I -> M instead of an element of M is that there's no otherwise suitable definition of element.
2014-02-25 22:14:37	Cale	But here we know that we have a category, so it's best to be specific about what is meant.
2014-02-25 22:14:48	imprimable	ok
2014-02-25 22:14:54	imprimable	because you work in a category of functors
2014-02-25 22:14:54	imprimable	yes
2014-02-25 22:14:55	imprimable	i see
2014-02-25 22:15:15	imprimable	emr, of category, sorry
2014-02-25 22:15:46	Cale	Also, when we're going to talk about monoid objects, it really is helpful to be able to say that eta: I -> M
2014-02-25 22:16:16	Cale	because we have this I which is a name for an object of our category
2014-02-25 22:16:57	Cale	rather than having to talk about the image of the object of the one-object category under such a constant functor
2014-02-25 22:17:12	mr-	hehe, a natural transformation const_I -> const_M
2014-02-25 22:17:23	Cale	heh, yeah
2014-02-25 22:23:26	imprimable	is it me who is lagging hard or freenode still has some problems ?

2014-02-25 22:43:23	imprimable`	the associator is a trifunctor
2014-02-25 22:43:30	imprimable`	i suppose there's a lemma for trifunctor too

2014-02-26 01:56:34	imprimable	i have a question
2014-02-26 01:56:46	imprimable	suppose i have two functor F : C -> D
2014-02-26 01:56:53	imprimable	E : D-> C that are naturally equivalent
2014-02-26 01:57:34	imprimable	if C and D are finite
2014-02-26 01:58:23	tac	You mean naturally isomorphic?
2014-02-26 01:58:35	imprimable	clearly, the number of natural transformation from Id_C -> E°F might be different than the number of natural transformation from Id_D -> F°E
2014-02-26 01:58:37	imprimable	yes sorry
2014-02-26 01:58:42	tac	Natural transformations (and isomorphisms) must always be between parallel functors
2014-02-26 01:58:51	tac	F and E as you have them are antiparallel
2014-02-26 01:59:00	imprimable	well i have an equivalence of categories here
2014-02-26 01:59:10	imprimable	and i would like to know if there is a way to "count" the number of time the structure of E lies inside D
2014-02-26 01:59:15	imprimable	as the "indice" of a group
2014-02-26 01:59:25	imprimable	by counting the number of natural transformation
2014-02-26 01:59:28	imprimable	for finite categories
2014-02-26 01:59:33	imprimable	i guess its just the ratio of max/min
2014-02-26 01:59:47	imprimable	does it makes sense to "count" that
2014-02-26 01:59:48	imprimable	?
2014-02-26 01:59:49	imprimable	for example
2014-02-26 02:00:07	imprimable	Set_fin and Ord_fin are equivalent
2014-02-26 02:00:08	imprimable	and clearly
2014-02-26 02:00:18	imprimable	Set_fin contains "infinitely times" the structure of Ord_fin
2014-02-26 02:00:37	imprimable	because there are infinily much more natural transformation in one direction than the other
2014-02-26 02:00:37	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-26 02:00:52	imprimable	so does this concept exists or its useless ?
2014-02-26 02:01:00	tomprince	Are they equivalent?
2014-02-26 02:01:03	imprimable	yes
2014-02-26 02:01:04	imprimable	they are
2014-02-26 02:01:20	tac	I don't think you can get a very meaningful measure
2014-02-26 02:01:27	tomprince	It depends on what the morphisms in Ord are. (Often they are the order preserving morphisms, in which case they aren't equivalent.
2014-02-26 02:01:40	imprimable	oh, here the morphism are the same as in Sets_fin
2014-02-26 02:01:52	imprimable	tac: ok, so it only works for finite categories ?
2014-02-26 02:01:56	tac	Even something like Set_fin, I'm pretty sure, is not even a small category. What you get back isn't even a cardinality.
2014-02-26 02:02:02	imprimable	aha ok
2014-02-26 02:02:03	tac	maybe
2014-02-26 02:02:05	tomprince	So Ord_fin is just a skeleton of Set_fin.
2014-02-26 02:02:06	tac	maybe I'm wrong there
2014-02-26 02:02:10	imprimable	yes tomprince exactly
2014-02-26 02:02:20	imprimable	but it looks like with natural equivalence
2014-02-26 02:02:23	imprimable	you can "count"
2014-02-26 02:02:32	imprimable	the number of times the structure of one category lies inside the other
2014-02-26 02:02:37	imprimable	by counting the number of natural transformation
2014-02-26 02:02:50	imprimable	so i was wondering if there was some concept that generalizes it for at least, small categories

2014-02-26 02:04:53	imprimable`	<imprimable> but it looks like with natural equivalence

2014-02-26 02:04:55	imprimable`	<imprimable> so certainly it is enough to compare a category with its skeleton
2014-02-26 02:04:55	imprimable`	<imprimable> to have the good concept
2014-02-26 02:05:15	imprimable`	so you can count the amount of times the "same structure" lies inside a given category
2014-02-26 02:05:58	tomprince	Well, for one thing, I'm not sure if there is a good way to count, since different isomorphism classes might have a different number of representitives.
2014-02-26 02:06:20	imprimable`	hm
2014-02-26 02:06:44	tomprince	Consider the categories with 0, 0', 1, 2 and the one with 0, 1, 1', 2 and the one with 0, 1, 2, 2'.

2014-02-26 02:09:22	tomprince	I think if you are interested in something along those lines, it would be useful to come up with some examples where you have good reasons where you have some naive reasonable counte, and see if there is any uniform way to come up with that count.
2014-02-26 02:09:39	imprimable`	yes i see

2014-02-26 02:12:09	tomprince	There are a number of ways of quotienting a category, that don't always coincide.
2014-02-26 02:12:41	imprimable`	ahah damn
2014-02-26 02:13:28	tomprince	And aren't always defined.
2014-02-26 02:13:42	imprimable`	how comes you can't always quotient by the skeleton ?
2014-02-26 02:13:42	tomprince	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/groupoid+cardinality might be of interest.
2014-02-26 02:13:45	imprimable`	thx
2014-02-26 02:13:52	imprimable`	naively, its the "good way todo it"
2014-02-26 02:13:57	imprimable`	i don't see why it wouldn't work
2014-02-26 02:14:03	tomprince	What do you mean "quotient by the skeleton"?
2014-02-26 02:14:39	imprimable`	i don't know a good definition of qotienting by a subcategory
2014-02-26 02:14:40	imprimable`	ahah
2014-02-26 02:15:00	imprimable`	but "naively" you would like to do it
2014-02-26 02:15:20	imprimable`	oh i think i understand why it doesnt work
2014-02-26 02:15:30	imprimable`	because you can always add some object that is isomorphic to one another
2014-02-26 02:15:43	imprimable`	and you won't have an "integer" if you quotient by the skeleton
2014-02-26 02:15:45	imprimable`	so its not a category
2014-02-26 02:15:54	imprimable`	so you need the ambiant actegory to have some strong properties first
2014-02-26 02:16:06	imprimable`	but it should be possible for some categories
2014-02-26 02:16:21	imprimable`	that are "full"
2014-02-26 02:16:37	imprimable`	full in the sense, the "number of times the same structure lies inside" is an inetger
2014-02-26 02:16:53	imprimable`	do you know any concept for such categories ?
2014-02-26 02:17:12	tomprince	Well, so do you have an example of two categories, and what there quotient should be?
2014-02-26 02:17:23	imprimable`	ok wait
2014-02-26 02:17:29	imprimable`	0 0', 1, 1'
2014-02-26 02:17:35	imprimable`	quotient by 0,1
2014-02-26 02:17:45	imprimable`	you should obtain 0', 1'
2014-02-26 02:17:52	imprimable`	you only keep one object in equivalent class of object
2014-02-26 02:17:59	imprimable`	and all the arrows
2014-02-26 02:18:06	imprimable`	(between the resulting object)
2014-02-26 02:18:23	imprimable`	so you need your "hom set" to be full
2014-02-26 02:18:31	imprimable`	and your isomorphism class of objects to be "full" too
2014-02-26 02:18:53	imprimable`	of course, if you have 0,0', 1, you can't quotient by 0,1
2014-02-26 02:19:13	tomprince	Hmm. That doesn't feel like a quotient to me.
2014-02-26 02:19:17	imprimable`	ah
2014-02-26 02:19:30	imprimable`	hm tr
2014-02-26 02:19:31	imprimable`	tre
2014-02-26 02:19:32	imprimable`	true
2014-02-26 02:19:40	imprimable`	hm wait
2014-02-26 02:19:48	imprimable`	i should obtain a discrete category
2014-02-26 02:19:49	imprimable`	you're right
2014-02-26 02:20:04	imprimable`	but here it works, i have the discrete category with 2 objects
2014-02-26 02:20:12	imprimable`	and it works because 0,0', 1,1'
2014-02-26 02:20:16	imprimable`	i have twice the same structure

2014-02-26 02:20:47	tomprince	Well, so it perhaps is interesting to look at what quotienting looks like in Set.
2014-02-26 02:20:52	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 02:21:04	imprimable`	well i would quotient Set_fin by Ord_fin
2014-02-26 02:21:05	imprimable`	for example
2014-02-26 02:21:30	tomprince	If you have a set {0,1,2,3}, and quotient it by {0,1}, then you get {*,2,3}.
2014-02-26 02:21:40	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 02:22:18	tomprince	Interestingly, if you take the pushoutout of {*} <- {0,1} -> {0,1,2,3}, then you get {*,2,3}
2014-02-26 02:22:44	tomprince	Which also work in groups.

2014-02-26 02:22:56	imprimable`	wait, let me think
2014-02-26 02:23:01	imprimable`	i'm not that familiarize with pushout
2014-02-26 02:23:02	imprimable`	:>
2014-02-26 02:23:45	imprimable`	ok
2014-02-26 02:23:47	imprimable`	got it
2014-02-26 02:23:58	imprimable`	where you have the injection {0,1} to {0,1,2,3=
2014-02-26 02:24:24	imprimable`	and a pushout is like a quotient right ?
2014-02-26 02:24:32	imprimable`	(because its like a co equilizer)
2014-02-26 02:24:59	tomprince	Some pushouts are.
2014-02-26 02:25:05	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 02:25:21	imprimable`	so its better to interprete them as a way to "glue" things ?
2014-02-26 02:25:31	tomprince	In this particular case, pushout with one tip being a terminal object.
2014-02-26 02:27:33	imprimable`	hm
2014-02-26 02:27:43	imprimable`	i think it doesn't work because of exactly your previous remark
2014-02-26 02:27:56	imprimable`	<tomprince> Well, for one thing, I'm not sure if there is a good way to count, since different isomorphism classes might have a different number of representitives.
2014-02-26 02:28:07	tomprince	But, I don't think this gets you what you want, since quotienting by a skeleton leaves you with only a single isomorphism class in the quotient.
2014-02-26 02:28:12	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 02:29:09	imprimable`	or you really have to "complete" your category first
2014-02-26 02:29:17	imprimable`	but i don't know how to
2014-02-26 02:29:47	tomprince	No, the problem is that it identifies too much, not that it doesn't identify enough.
2014-02-26 02:30:35	imprimable`	yes, so you complete it so it doesn't identify the objects with the ones you added
2014-02-26 02:30:39	imprimable`	i dunno
2014-02-26 02:31:43	imprimable`	if i think about 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, for example
2014-02-26 02:31:45	tomprince	You might be able to get away with quotienting by http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/core
2014-02-26 02:32:04	imprimable`	and i want to quotient by {0,1,2} i would need to complete it with 0 0 and 1
2014-02-26 02:32:11	imprimable`	let me check
2014-02-26 02:33:30	tomprince	In any case, what you are describing sounds closer to subtraction that division.
2014-02-26 02:33:57	imprimable`	its a mix i guess
2014-02-26 02:34:05	imprimable`	its like a division by a "poset"
2014-02-26 02:35:14	imprimable`	its like, you really need to complete the category before you quotient it
2014-02-26 02:35:39	imprimable`	and you need to complete differently regarding your quotient

2014-02-26 04:45:32	imprimable`	i have a stupid question
2014-02-26 04:45:46	imprimable`	why do we bother to show natural equivalence of categories when its enough to show isomorphism between skeleton ?
2014-02-26 04:46:20	imprimable`	is it actually simpler to show a natural equivalence than to take the skeleton and show explicitly the isomorphism ?
2014-02-26 04:50:25	tomprince	Constructing the skeleton requires axiom of choice.
2014-02-26 04:50:44	imprimable`	because you need to chose one object in the same isomorphism class ?
2014-02-26 04:50:58	imprimable`	for each isomorphism class i mean

2014-02-26 05:14:14	Cale	In general it requires infinitely many arbitrary choices to be made, and you won't know which choices the function given to you by the axiom of choice made. So you'd have to construct an isomorphism, but doing that with only the knowledge that you have an arbitrary object from each isomorphism class of objects in each of the categories. If you work out the details of what's required, you'll find that it's prett
2014-02-26 05:14:14	Cale	y much the same thing as constructing a natural equivalence.
2014-02-26 05:14:54	imprimable`	ok
2014-02-26 05:15:00	imprimable`	so the concept of skeleton is more or less useless
2014-02-26 05:15:31	Cale	Somewhat, yeah.

2014-02-26 05:18:04	Cale	I'm not sure I'd say useless, but it definitely goes against the spirit of category theory in general. As we head towards higher-dimensional categories, we're not supposed to care about whether things are equal, only whether there's some higher-level maps witnessing some relationship between them.
2014-02-26 05:18:38	imprimable`	yes but when i look at the concept of equivalence and natural isomorphism
2014-02-26 05:18:45	imprimable`	i really really want to do like in HoTT
2014-02-26 05:18:47	imprimable`	and claims
2014-02-26 05:18:52	imprimable`	=_C <=> ~
2014-02-26 05:19:25	imprimable`	or =_C = ~
2014-02-26 05:19:26	imprimable`	ahah
2014-02-26 05:19:26	imprimable`	dunno
2014-02-26 05:19:29	imprimable`	you understand the idea
2014-02-26 05:19:29	imprimable`	:>
2014-02-26 05:22:08	Cale	In HoTT, the notion of equality is quite different, so you get away with it more easily. For precategories in HoTT, it doesn't require the axiom of choice to get an equivalence to a category where the type of isomorphisms between two objects is equivalent to the type of equalities between those objects.
2014-02-26 05:23:13	imprimable`	but clearly because category theory is about the structure, one wants to remove all the data that are redundant
2014-02-26 05:24:46	Cale	In HoTT, you don't actually lose any information about those isomorphisms, you're effectively just subsuming it into HoTT's equality types, which are more structured than a yes/no proposition, and so can actually carry all the information about what the isomorphism in question was.
2014-02-26 05:25:07	imprimable`	yes, the equality is becoming relative to your catgory if you od that
2014-02-26 05:25:10	imprimable`	you need a new operation
2014-02-26 05:25:20	imprimable`	the =_C operation
2014-02-26 05:25:29	imprimable`	but this should be possible isn't it ?
2014-02-26 05:25:33	Cale	hm?
2014-02-26 05:25:46	imprimable`	you introduce a new kind of equality that is relative to your category
2014-02-26 05:25:50	imprimable`	=_C <=> ~
2014-02-26 05:26:04	imprimable`	so you already have your "skeleton" with =_C
2014-02-26 05:26:21	Cale	Except it's not quite like the skeleton really.
2014-02-26 05:26:39	imprimable`	hm, why ?
2014-02-26 05:26:40	Cale	We haven't made any arbitrary choice of objects, only glued in paths between the objects which were isomorphic
2014-02-26 05:26:45	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 05:26:48	Cale	So they're still all there
2014-02-26 05:26:57	Cale	it's just they have new equations between them
2014-02-26 05:27:17	imprimable`	well, then you do the "category =_C" from the category C
2014-02-26 05:27:31	Cale	I'm not sure I understand
2014-02-26 05:27:50	imprimable`	as far as i understand the univalence principle
2014-02-26 05:27:54	imprimable`	it depends on a "context"
2014-02-26 05:28:02	imprimable`	in HotT, your context is your space A
2014-02-26 05:28:06	imprimable`	in CT, it is the category C
2014-02-26 05:28:18	Cale	What?
2014-02-26 05:28:39	Cale	I thought we were talking about how HoTT treats category theory
2014-02-26 05:28:40	imprimable`	maybe i didn't understand anything ? :>
2014-02-26 05:28:43	imprimable`	no
2014-02-26 05:28:58	imprimable`	i'm trying to have category theory with univalence axiom without doing hott
2014-02-26 05:29:05	Cale	heh
2014-02-26 05:29:10	Cale	Well, I have no idea what that means
2014-02-26 05:29:14	imprimable`	well, its the same really
2014-02-26 05:29:17	imprimable`	just put for any category C
2014-02-26 05:29:21	imprimable`	=_C <=> ~
2014-02-26 05:29:29	imprimable`	you need a new equality relation that is relative to your category
2014-02-26 05:29:31	Cale	In ZF?
2014-02-26 05:29:34	Cale	Or ZFC?
2014-02-26 05:29:43	imprimable`	i don't know, i want to take CT as fundation for maths anyway
2014-02-26 05:29:47	imprimable`	lawvere did that
2014-02-26 05:29:53	Cale	You can already talk about whether objects are isomorphic
2014-02-26 05:29:53	imprimable`	so lets say we are in CT for fundation of maths
2014-02-26 05:29:53	imprimable`	:>
2014-02-26 05:30:00	Cale	That's complicated...
2014-02-26 05:30:22	Cale	Well, okay, I suppose we can naively say we're working in some ETCS sort of setting
2014-02-26 05:30:34	imprimable`	then you just have to add a new operation
2014-02-26 05:30:36	imprimable`	the =_C operation
2014-02-26 05:30:46	imprimable`	and you do all your CT theory on it
2014-02-26 05:31:07	Cale	(But actually constructing that from the ground up without going through ZFC is probably worse than just building ZFC)
2014-02-26 05:31:19	imprimable`	(aha, i don't know it yet but i would like to)
2014-02-26 05:31:55	Cale	I don't understand how this =_C operation is not just isomorphism of objects in C?
2014-02-26 05:32:09	Cale	If =_C <=> ~ then why not just use ~ ?
2014-02-26 05:32:16	imprimable`	hm
2014-02-26 05:32:28	imprimable`	i want to "glue" together the object
2014-02-26 05:32:32	Cale	(Also, what's ~? Am I right in assuming you mean isomorphism?)
2014-02-26 05:32:33	imprimable`	maybe you have to remove from beginning equality
2014-02-26 05:32:37	imprimable`	(yes i do)
2014-02-26 05:33:21	Cale	Equality is something in the logic you're using to discuss categories. If you're using first-order logic, it comes with its own notion of equality.
2014-02-26 05:33:34	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 05:33:47	Cale	and your definition of what a category is in the first place makes use of that
2014-02-26 05:34:00	imprimable`	yes but you could build it directly with =_C
2014-02-26 05:34:05	imprimable`	ie, "up to isomorphism" (in some sense)
2014-02-26 05:34:17	Cale	I'm not sure what you're trying to do
2014-02-26 05:34:34	Cale	Things which it makes sense to do in HoTT don't all make sense in FOL.
2014-02-26 05:34:39	imprimable`	i'm trying to have categories that are "only" skeleton
2014-02-26 05:34:48	imprimable`	FOL = ?
2014-02-26 05:34:53	Cale	first order logic
2014-02-26 05:34:56	imprimable`	oh
2014-02-26 05:35:01	imprimable`	well you need to change the logic then
2014-02-26 05:35:01	imprimable`	:<
2014-02-26 05:35:10	Cale	Sure, well, we can just use HoTT
2014-02-26 05:35:22	imprimable`	ahah

2014-02-26 05:35:25	imprimable`	aso
2014-02-26 05:35:25	imprimable`	also
2014-02-26 05:35:39	imprimable`	but the isomorphism is category dependant in CT
2014-02-26 05:35:46	imprimable`	its like a "point of view" "context"
2014-02-26 05:36:02	imprimable`	so you really want to have an equality that is also category dependant
2014-02-26 05:36:41	tomprince	What is specialy about calling it "equality" rather than 'isomorphism' or 'glickildrock'.
2014-02-26 05:37:19	imprimable`	well, the idea would be to identify all isomorphism objects in order to keep only skeleton categor
2014-02-26 05:37:27	imprimable`	from the very beginning of CT
2014-02-26 05:37:33	imprimable`	everything would be understood "modulo isomorphism"
2014-02-26 05:37:35	Cale	imprimable`: That's not a good thing to do, in general
2014-02-26 05:37:35	imprimable`	with =_C
2014-02-26 05:37:45	Cale	Maybe you care about those objects
2014-02-26 05:37:57	imprimable`	why would you care about those objects in a given category C ?
2014-02-26 05:38:14	Cale	Well, here's an artificial example...
2014-02-26 05:40:26	Cale	Suppose you have a small category C. Consider the real vector space spanned by the arrows of C (i.e. each vector is a finite real linear combination of arrows in the category, which we'll think of as a sum).
2014-02-26 05:41:24	Cale	We can turn it into an algebra by defining the product of two arrows to be 0 if they are not composable, and to be their composite if they are (and extending this to a bilinear map on the whole space)
2014-02-26 05:43:16	Cale	i.e. (sum over a in Arr(C) of r_a a) * (sum over b in Arr(C) of s_b b) = sum over c in Arr(C) of sum over a . b = c of r_a r_b c
2014-02-26 05:44:04	Cale	If C is an indiscrete category on n objects (i.e. where the n objects are all uniquely isomorphic to each other and there are no other arrows)
2014-02-26 05:44:22	Cale	then this is the same as the algebra of n-by-n matrices over R
2014-02-26 05:44:52	Cale	If C is the preorder category of the natural numbers, then this is the same as the polynomial ring R[x]
2014-02-26 05:45:12	Cale	er, the monoid category of the natural numbers, rather
2014-02-26 05:46:17	Cale	which makes more sense if you think of the arrows * -> * as being x^n for each natural number n, and composition as x^n . x^m = x^(n+m)
2014-02-26 05:47:00	Cale	Now, for the matrix algebra bit, if you skeletonise the category first, you certainly don't get the same matrix algebra
2014-02-26 05:47:06	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 05:47:26	imprimable`	but it can be that its your construction that is bad
2014-02-26 05:47:26	Cale	This might be somewhat of a contrived example though, I admit.
2014-02-26 05:47:37	imprimable`	because it uses isomorphic object
2014-02-26 05:47:59	imprimable`	in some sense its not canonical
2014-02-26 05:48:02	Cale	In general though, we don't want to think of isomorphisms as being trivial
2014-02-26 05:48:08	Cale	They carry lots of information in general
2014-02-26 05:48:23	imprimable`	i feel that what is "canonical" is precisely the skeleton
2014-02-26 05:48:23	Cale	It's the difference between the category of sets, and the category of cardinalities.
2014-02-26 05:48:28	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 05:48:42	imprimable`	but i would claim
2014-02-26 05:48:47	imprimable`	that the category of set is a bad category
2014-02-26 05:48:54	imprimable`	if i want =_C to be here from the beginning
2014-02-26 05:48:54	Cale	uhhhh
2014-02-26 05:49:19	imprimable`	=_C is a bad category because of comprehension axiom
2014-02-26 05:49:37	imprimable`	comprehnesion axioms gives you isomorphic set that contains totally different objects
2014-02-26 05:49:45	imprimable`	erm, Sets sorry
2014-02-26 05:49:50	imprimable`	Sets is bad because of such axioma
2014-02-26 05:50:00	imprimable`	you should be able to do math without the comprehension axioma
2014-02-26 05:50:04	imprimable`	and CT looks like it can do that
2014-02-26 05:50:05	tomprince	Besides the skeleton, having, for each isomorphism class, having an object for each element of the automorphism group probaly is interesting.

2014-02-26 05:50:44	imprimable`	Cale: because it links "theory" (ie, some abstract property) with explicit object
2014-02-26 05:50:53	imprimable`	you are linking a constructive process with a "definition" in some sense
2014-02-26 05:50:55	imprimable`	to me its bad
2014-02-26 05:51:03	imprimable`	comprehension axiom is in this respect really bad
2014-02-26 05:51:12	tomprince	It'd be nice if we could get away with identifying isomorphic objects, but we can't so far.

2014-02-26 05:52:05	imprimable`	well, because people "believes" too much in the category Sets i believe
2014-02-26 05:52:06	imprimable`	and in set theory
2014-02-26 05:52:33	imprimable`	comprehension axiom is really bad in the sense that it mixe what should not be mixed : concrete object with abstract property
2014-02-26 05:52:48	tomprince	imprimable`: People have been struggling with the desire to identify isomorphic objects since the before category theory existed.
2014-02-26 05:52:55	imprimable`	ahah
2014-02-26 05:52:56	imprimable`	ok :>
2014-02-26 05:53:13	imprimable`	so HoTT really is revolutionnary in this respect
2014-02-26 05:53:15	imprimable`	?
2014-02-26 05:53:17	Cale	Taking skeletons is a really naive approach to it and doesn't work well
2014-02-26 05:54:07	Cale	Even in HoTT, they just make part of the definition of a category that the obvious map which sends equalities of objects to isomorphisms between them (defined by path induction) is an equivalence
2014-02-26 05:54:26	Cale	and categories which don't satisfy that are called precategories
2014-02-26 05:54:47	Cale	and there are good examples of precategories which are not categories
2014-02-26 05:55:16	Cale	However, every precategory is equivalent to some category, and you don't need the axiom of choice to build it.
2014-02-26 05:55:32	imprimable`	equivalent in which sense ?
2014-02-26 05:56:01	Cale	In the sense of equivalence of precategories (which is basically defined the same way as equivalence of categories in common mathematics)
2014-02-26 05:56:32	imprimable`	ok
2014-02-26 05:56:44	Cale	But also, categories don't behave like skeletons do, because of all the ways that equality in HoTT is different from equality in classical mathematics
2014-02-26 05:57:00	imprimable`	ok
2014-02-26 05:57:06	imprimable`	so =_C is really too naive
2014-02-26 05:57:07	Cale	Types in HoTT are groupoids
2014-02-26 05:57:14	Cale	(infinity groupoids)
2014-02-26 05:57:31	Cale	where the arrows in the groupoid are the equalities between its terms
2014-02-26 05:57:50	Cale	and so *all* the structure is still there
2014-02-26 05:57:59	tomprince	If your =_C worked naively, people would have been using it already.
2014-02-26 05:58:09	imprimable`	ahah, thats true tomprince

2014-02-26 05:59:33	Saizan	how does the construction of a category out of a precategory goes?
2014-02-26 05:59:35	Cale	Because its notion of equality is (for some types, potentially) complicated

2014-02-26 06:00:56	tomprince	One reason the naive idea doesn't work, is because you can reasonably have different constructions that end up being isomorphic. But if that means that they already have to be equal, it makes it hard to talk about the proof that they are isomorphic.
2014-02-26 06:01:04	Cale	So, given a precategory A with type of objects A_0 (this is an arbitrary type, not necessarily a set, though the Homs are sets)

2014-02-26 06:01:23	imprimable`	hm
2014-02-26 06:01:27	imprimable`	thats a good example tomprince
2014-02-26 06:01:58	tomprince	Or, Z and Q as sets.
2014-02-26 06:02:00	Cale	You define a higher inductive type which in the book is written A_0 with a hat, but I'll just call it A_*
2014-02-26 06:02:11	Cale	and it has constructors:
2014-02-26 06:02:17	Cale	i: A_0 -> A_*
2014-02-26 06:03:17	Saizan	oh, you just "quotient" out by the isomorphims?
2014-02-26 06:03:18	Cale	for each a, b objects of A, and e an isomorphism a ~= b, an equality j e : i a = i b
2014-02-26 06:03:18	tomprince	imprimable`: And considering the forgetful functor Group -> Set. If you only have the skeletons, that takes Z and Q to the same object.
2014-02-26 06:03:41	imprimable`	tomprince: yes but Sets is a bad category if you think about structure only
2014-02-26 06:03:42	Cale	and for each a an object of A, an equality j(1_a) = refl_(i a)
2014-02-26 06:03:53	imprimable`	(i really think the comprehension axiom is bad)
2014-02-26 06:04:08	imprimable`	(so every concrete category i "bad" in this respect)
2014-02-26 06:04:14	tomprince	But then then the image of the map Z -> Q is some odd endomorphism.
2014-02-26 06:04:24	tomprince	Why is comprehension bad?
2014-02-26 06:04:48	imprimable`	because it mixes what is implicit (ie, an "idea"), with what is explicit (and totally "contructed", an object)
2014-02-26 06:04:55	Cale	and for each a, b, c objects of A and isomorphisms f : a ~= b and g : b ~= c, an equality j (g o f) = j f . j g (where g o f is composition in the category and . is path concatenation)
2014-02-26 06:05:15	imprimable`	to me you should never mix bothes
2014-02-26 06:05:19	Cale	and then a 1-truncation constructor
2014-02-26 06:05:34	tomprince	imprimable`: I still haven't understood what distinction you are trying to make there.
2014-02-26 06:05:39	imprimable`	ah
2014-02-26 06:05:48	imprimable`	think about a definition for example

2014-02-26 06:05:57	imprimable`	like, the definition of being associative
2014-02-26 06:06:14	Saizan	Cale: it made sense, thanks
2014-02-26 06:06:25	imprimable`	it works for nobody in particular, ie, everyone (or even nobody, you don't know if there exists an associative map)
2014-02-26 06:06:30	imprimable`	(binary relation i mean)
2014-02-26 06:06:42	imprimable`	this represents the "idea" of what it means to be associative

2014-02-26 06:07:17	imprimable`	they are not ideas
2014-02-26 06:07:23	imprimable`	they have no "meaning"
2014-02-26 06:07:38	imprimable`	but the property of these objects have some meaning : for example + is associative
2014-02-26 06:07:50	imprimable`	comprehension axiom is mixing both definition and construction
2014-02-26 06:07:57	Cale	Saizan: So yeah, *basically* you just subsume all the isomorphisms of the category, turning them into paths in the type of objects, and make sure that identity and composition of isomorphisms are respected
2014-02-26 06:08:00	imprimable`	so it makes blurry the distinction between implicit and explicit
2014-02-26 06:08:55	imprimable`	in some sense, i could say that N doesnt exist in my point of view, but you have the objects 0, 1 , 2, ... somewhere
2014-02-26 06:09:03	imprimable`	and some "operation" to put them in a same bag
2014-02-26 06:09:06	imprimable`	that you call "N"
2014-02-26 06:09:20	imprimable`	but this "N" is never defined with comprehnesion axiom
2014-02-26 06:10:00	imprimable`	and if you don't mix both, you can have a dialog between "ideas" and contructed objects

2014-02-26 06:10:23	imprimable`	for example, an "idea" can be called a characterization of an object if there is a unique object that has its property
2014-02-26 06:10:26	imprimable`	reciprocly
2014-02-26 06:10:39	imprimable`	youcan do the same
2014-02-26 06:10:41	imprimable`	you can ask
2014-02-26 06:10:52	imprimable`	"does it exists some ideas that have no objects ?" (cf richard paradox)
2014-02-26 06:10:54	imprimable`	or reciprocly

2014-02-26 06:11:31	imprimable`	well i make a funadmental distinction between ideas and objects
2014-02-26 06:11:41	imprimable`	thats why i dislike comprehnesion axiom
2014-02-26 06:12:18	Cale	Saizan: The HoTT book doesn't. It just focuses on the definitions of various types of category and their relationships
2014-02-26 06:12:27	tomprince	I'm not sure how anything you've just said relates to any form of comprehension axiom. (Other than perhaps the silly one that leads to russel's paradox)
2014-02-26 06:12:37	Cale	Saizan: It doesn't build up any significant part of category theory itself.

2014-02-26 06:13:09	Cale	actually, I lied
2014-02-26 06:13:11	Cale	heh
2014-02-26 06:13:13	imprimable`	and it is defined with some characterizing properties
2014-02-26 06:13:23	imprimable`	so it mixes "ideas" and "objects"
2014-02-26 06:13:32	Cale	It does the Yoneda lemma
2014-02-26 06:13:37	Cale	but that's about it :)
2014-02-26 06:14:23	imprimable`	richard paradox to me is a "proof" tht you shouldn't mix both
2014-02-26 06:14:34	imprimable`	thats its fundamentally different
2014-02-26 06:14:36	Saizan	Cale: fair enough, lately i'm wondering what's the best way to work with things like limits in type theory, e.g. when defining a pullback the naive way is a record type with the 2 maps and the universal property and the laws, but that induces quite a bit of boilerplate
2014-02-26 06:15:40	imprimable`	if you think that the idea is the object, then you have richard paradox
2014-02-26 06:15:45	Cale	Saizan: The HoTT library seems to contain that stuff though: https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/blob/master/theories/categories/Limits/Core.v
2014-02-26 06:15:56	imprimable`	if you belive that the idea can denote "nothing" as an object, because it is just an idea, then its no problem
2014-02-26 06:16:05	imprimable`	reciprocly, an object can be impossible to characterize
2014-02-26 06:16:10	imprimable`	and it should be fun to find such object

2014-02-26 06:16:58	Saizan	Cale: heh
2014-02-26 06:17:51	Cale	imprimable`: What's the Richard paradox?
2014-02-26 06:18:14	imprimable`	it is a syntaxic paradox
2014-02-26 06:18:20	imprimable`	it says
2014-02-26 06:18:23	Cale	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard's_paradox ?
2014-02-26 06:18:25	imprimable`	yes
2014-02-26 06:18:25	imprimable`	this one
2014-02-26 06:18:39	imprimable`	read it, maybe it will be enounced better than what i could do with my bad english :>
2014-02-26 06:20:08	Cale	I don't see how this applies to set comprehension
2014-02-26 06:20:21	imprimable`	richard's paradox is equivalent to ask
2014-02-26 06:20:25	imprimable`	or to claim
2014-02-26 06:20:33	imprimable`	"the smallest integer that can be written in at least 50 syllabes"
2014-02-26 06:20:33	Cale	Since set comprehension is part of the axiomatic system under discussion in the first place.
2014-02-26 06:20:48	imprimable`	but "the smallest integer that can be written in at least 50 syllabes" is such number
2014-02-26 06:20:58	imprimable`	and it is written in less than 50 syllabes
2014-02-26 06:21:03	imprimable`	so such integer doesn't exist
2014-02-26 06:21:50	Cale	Yeah, but that's just confusion about what English sentences actually make sense in the formalism.
2014-02-26 06:22:09	imprimable`	yes you can interprete it like that
2014-02-26 06:22:11	imprimable`	i would agree
2014-02-26 06:22:15	imprimable`	but to me it says more
2014-02-26 06:22:32	imprimable`	it also says that you should not think that the "idea" is the denoted object
2014-02-26 06:22:38	imprimable`	an idea can denote nothing
2014-02-26 06:22:50	imprimable`	and reciprocaly, and object can be impossible to denote by an idea
2014-02-26 06:25:00	Cale	What does "idea" mean here?
2014-02-26 06:25:09	imprimable`	that the point
2014-02-26 06:25:14	imprimable`	you have to define what it means
2014-02-26 06:25:20	Cale	No, you do :)
2014-02-26 06:25:27	Cale	You're the one who used the word
2014-02-26 06:25:36	Cale	also "object"
2014-02-26 06:25:39	imprimable`	its something implicit tht use the language of your theory but is not constructed
2014-02-26 06:25:47	imprimable`	and an object is something that is constructed from the axioma

2014-02-26 06:26:13	imprimable`	and successor function
2014-02-26 06:26:21	imprimable`	you can construct the object 0, 1, 2, ...
2014-02-26 06:26:41	imprimable`	but a binary relation is an "idea"
2014-02-26 06:26:53	imprimable`	it doesn't denote any object that is a binary relation in particular
2014-02-26 06:26:58	imprimable`	it denotes a priori all of them
2014-02-26 06:27:01	Cale	So an idea is a relation?
2014-02-26 06:27:03	imprimable`	so it is the "idea of what a binary relation is"
2014-02-26 06:27:05	imprimable`	no
2014-02-26 06:27:16	imprimable`	an idea is something constructed with the language of your theory that doesn't denote anything in particular

2014-02-26 06:27:35	Cale	What sort of something?
2014-02-26 06:27:50	imprimable`	a correct sentence
2014-02-26 06:27:56	imprimable`	i don't know, i can't define it rigorously
2014-02-26 06:28:01	imprimable`	but there's a fundamental difference
2014-02-26 06:28:05	imprimable`	and one should formalize that
2014-02-26 06:28:05	imprimable`	:>
2014-02-26 06:28:30	Saizan	sounds like a predicate to me
2014-02-26 06:28:49	imprimable`	kind of
2014-02-26 06:28:51	imprimable`	but not only
2014-02-26 06:29:30	imprimable`	for example Cale
2014-02-26 06:29:44	imprimable`	Group theory is a theory in the sense that you only manipulate "ideas"
2014-02-26 06:29:47	Cale	Your inability to define this is not helping me build confidence that all the other stuff you had to say about it is actually correct ;)
2014-02-26 06:30:03	imprimable`	you don't even know if a group exist as an object in your theory
2014-02-26 06:30:05	imprimable`	in ZF/ZFC
2014-02-26 06:30:16	Cale	What?
2014-02-26 06:30:20	imprimable`	Cale: well, i can't YET : (
2014-02-26 06:30:28	Cale	You can prove the existence of groups in ZFC.
2014-02-26 06:30:29	Saizan	on another note, any good reference for the composition of sections? otherwise i'll need to work it out :)
2014-02-26 06:30:43	imprimable`	Cale: yes, but not when you do group theory ! at first you don't know if one group exists
2014-02-26 06:30:44	imprimable`	a priori
2014-02-26 06:31:02	Cale	imprimable`: uh, I guess?
2014-02-26 06:31:30	imprimable`	what i want to say is
2014-02-26 06:31:33	Cale	You can prove lots of things about all groups without showing that any group happens to exist
2014-02-26 06:31:42	imprimable`	yes, thats what i'm saying
2014-02-26 06:31:43	Saizan	imprimable`: are you against having a set of groups before proving some exist?
2014-02-26 06:31:44	Cale	but it's not hard to show that groups exist
2014-02-26 06:31:48	Saizan	*some groups
2014-02-26 06:31:57	imprimable`	Saizan: no not at all, but i want to make a difference between that
2014-02-26 06:31:59	imprimable`	a clear difference
2014-02-26 06:32:12	imprimable`	so it might make sense to claimm
2014-02-26 06:32:20	imprimable`	"this object can't be characterized by any idea"
2014-02-26 06:32:34	imprimable`	which is the reciprocal of "this idea doesn't denote any object"
2014-02-26 06:34:17	imprimable`	and in some sense cale
2014-02-26 06:34:20	imprimable`	the structure is an idea
2014-02-26 06:34:37	imprimable`	like, the structure Z/2Z is not the equivalence class of ...

2014-02-27 05:15:47	imprimable	well its not encouraging to pass 2 hours on 2 pages
2014-02-27 05:15:49	tac_	I think worse than going too slowly, the dangerous part is getting stuck and thinking "oh, well maybe i'm just not clever enough"

2014-02-27 05:44:33	tac_	I never found anything I read from Tao to be all that inspiring...
2014-02-27 05:44:53	tac_	where was that thing I read the other week though...
2014-02-27 05:45:19	tac_	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236
2014-02-27 05:45:36	tac_	I thought that was really interesting
2014-02-27 05:46:16	imprimable`	oh i think i already opene this pdf
2014-02-27 05:46:23	imprimable`	gonna check it again
2014-02-27 05:47:06	tac_	I think Thurston makes a very good (and personally-found) argument against the idea that "mathematics is about proving new things"
2014-02-27 05:47:47	tac_	He argues more about mathematics is about finding novel ways of looking at things and finding new ways of thinking of things
2014-02-27 05:47:55	imprimable`	to me science (and mathematics) is about "understanding"
2014-02-27 05:48:00	tac_	(where those things are abstract, logically-bound things)
2014-02-27 05:48:08	imprimable`	ie, finding and building new theoretcal framework that encompass the older and are deeper
2014-02-27 05:48:35	imprimable`	i think its not just finding "novel way"
2014-02-27 05:48:38	imprimable`	its finding deeper ways
2014-02-27 05:49:30	tac_	I think either works
2014-02-27 05:49:46	tac_	You want deeper, but it's fun to see things from another angle than previously
2014-02-27 05:50:12	tac_	Geometry was originally about points and lines and circles in Euclid's time
2014-02-27 05:51:00	tac_	In the 1500s, people moved towards coordinates. A point was a pair of numbers
2014-02-27 05:51:04	tac_	A line was a bunch of points
2014-02-27 05:51:16	imprimable`	in some sense, this description is deeper
2014-02-27 05:51:24	imprimable`	because it "explains" what is a line
2014-02-27 05:51:47	tac_	You then have people talking about vectorspaces. Not only do points have coordinates, but you can scale them and push them around
2014-02-27 05:52:11	tac_	But that distinguishes a point, so maybe you meant affine space, which is a vectorspace acting on the cartesian plane
2014-02-27 05:52:32	tac_	Those vector and affine spaces have a natural notion of distance, and you get metric spaces
2014-02-27 05:52:37	tac_	And metric spaces lead to topological spaces
2014-02-27 05:52:49	imprimable`	yes, but as you can see
2014-02-27 05:52:54	tac_	but then, you also have projective geometry, where the usual metric doesn't work so well
2014-02-27 05:52:54	imprimable`	there is in some sense a "progression" in abstraction
2014-02-27 05:52:56	tac_	Yeah, I'm rambling

2014-02-27 21:37:26	imprimable	is it me or is yoneda lemma really not trivial at all ?
2014-02-27 21:37:35	imprimable	i understand what it means "graphically" in Sets
2014-02-27 21:37:40	imprimable	but this doesn't look obvious at all
2014-02-27 21:41:36	imprimable	why is it called a lemma and not a theorem
2014-02-27 21:41:43	imprimable	its really far from being obvious
2014-02-27 22:06:48	Saizan	well, it's one of those things that are hard because they are simple
2014-02-27 22:09:33	imprimable	i don't understand "where does it come from"
2014-02-27 22:09:40	imprimable	i understand the proof, i understand the statement
2014-02-27 22:09:48	imprimable	but i can't understand "why" its true without proof
2014-02-27 22:16:16	Saizan	the thing is that the naturality constraint in "Nat(Hom(A,-),F(-))" is so strong that you can only construct such a natural transformation by partially applying the action on morphisms of F
2014-02-27 22:17:20	Saizan	partially applying it to something in F(A), and so by id_A you can get it back
2014-02-27 22:18:12	Saizan	there's also a deep connection with the J rule from HoTT :)
2014-02-27 22:18:17	imprimable	ahah

2014-02-28 00:52:16	Cale	imprimable: A better name for the Yoneda lemma, I think, would be the completion theorem for categories (by analogy with similar sorts of theorems from analysis and algebra)
2014-02-28 00:52:54	Cale	imprimable: It tells you that you can take any category C, no matter how poorly behaved, and embed it in a category which has pretty much all the widgets you could ever ask for.
2014-02-28 00:54:29	Cale	Sets^(C^op) is complete and cocomplete, it has exponentials, it has a subobject classifier (making it into a topos), so you have all the techniques for getting arrows that you could ever want. You can interpret Coq programs in such a thing.
2014-02-28 00:55:46	Cale	and it lets you embed C into Sets^(C^op) in such a way that if you then use all that machinery to get an arrow between the images of two objects in C, then it must have come from an actual arrow which was already in C.

2014-02-28 01:12:02	imprimable	i don't "see" why its true without the proof
2014-02-28 01:12:55	imprimable	it in some sense says tha all the structure one can find in small categories are already present in Sets
2014-02-28 01:16:55	Cale	imprimable: It's not
2014-02-28 01:17:20	Cale	Lemmas don't necessarily have to be trivial, they just have to be useful devices for proving many other things.
2014-02-28 01:17:30	imprimable	yes
2014-02-28 01:17:36	imprimable	but i really don't understand it yet i think
2014-02-28 01:17:40	imprimable	i mean, i understand wht it says
2014-02-28 01:17:43	imprimable	but i can't see why its true
2014-02-28 01:18:00	Cale	Well, read the proof, go through the details. A lot of it is pretty mechanical
2014-02-28 01:18:04	imprimable	it feels "toe powerful to be true"
2014-02-28 01:18:12	imprimable	yes but the proof is not enlighting
2014-02-28 01:18:42	imprimable	maybe its not the best proof in awodey
2014-02-28 01:18:49	Cale	Well, most of the power just comes from the fact that Sets^(C^op) has all sorts of nice properties which are actually not part of the proof of the Yoneda lemma.
2014-02-28 01:19:13	Cale	and most of the nice properties of Sets^(C^op) come from the nice properties of Sets
2014-02-28 01:19:16	imprimable	yes, like, it is a CCC ?
2014-02-28 01:19:19	Cale	yeah
2014-02-28 01:19:48	imprimable	oh i was wondering
2014-02-28 01:20:33	imprimable	in Set^C you have the usual evaluation map that comes with the transpose of some map f
2014-02-28 01:20:45	imprimable	i mean, the evaluation map from Sets^CxC to Sets
2014-02-28 01:21:21	-->	dwcook (~danny@unaffiliated/dwcook) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-28 01:21:22	imprimable	this induce an evaluation map for all objects A of C from Sets^C to Sets
2014-02-28 01:21:35	Cale	yep
2014-02-28 01:21:37	dwcook	Is there a generalization of the free construction? What does "free X" where X is a structure generally mean?
2014-02-28 01:21:48	imprimable	this induced evaluation map doesn't come from an exponential diagram
2014-02-28 01:21:49	imprimable	why ?
2014-02-28 01:22:10	imprimable	is there some universal property to describe such induced evaluation maps ?
2014-02-28 01:22:14	Cale	dwcook: It means "left adjoint to some forgetful functor"
2014-02-28 01:22:46	dwcook	Cale, so it doesn't have a formal definition then? ("Forgetful" doesn't afaik)
2014-02-28 01:22:57	Cale	imprimable: Wait, it doesn't? The evaluation map does in general, you're just specialising it.
2014-02-28 01:23:09	imprimable	i tried to see from which exponential it came
2014-02-28 01:23:11	imprimable	i couldn't succeed
2014-02-28 01:23:31	Cale	dwcook: Yeah, forgetful functor doesn't have a formal definition.
2014-02-28 01:23:49	imprimable	i'm specializing an evaluation map, but its still an evaluation map right ?
2014-02-28 01:24:56	Cale	dwcook: The general idea though is that you're just ignoring some of the structure of whatever sort of object you have, so it's a functor that corresponds to some "all X are Y" kind of relationship.
2014-02-28 01:25:20	dwcook	Cale, what do you mean by "all X are Y"?
2014-02-28 01:25:20	Cale	dwcook: and the adjoint goes the other way, given some Y, freely generating some X in terms of it
2014-02-28 01:25:28	Cale	Like, all groups are monoids.
2014-02-28 01:25:29	dwcook	Also, I don't understand adjunctions yet
2014-02-28 01:25:36	dwcook	Oh, I see
2014-02-28 01:25:40	Cale	Or even, all groups are sets
2014-02-28 01:25:58	Cale	(have an underlying set, where we forget the operation)
2014-02-28 01:26:08	dwcook	Got it
2014-02-28 01:26:58	Cale	imprimable: I'm not sure it's specifically an exponential transpose any longer once you partially apply it.
2014-02-28 01:27:16	imprimable	yes its not, but maybe there's a name for such maps ?
2014-02-28 01:27:18	Cale	imprimable: But you get it via an exponential transpose in Cat, and then partially applying the resulting functor...
2014-02-28 01:27:37	imprimable	true that its an "induced" something
2014-02-28 01:27:50	dwcook	So, for any given structure, we usually just pick a functor that makes intuitive sense and call that the free one? e.g., free monoid is lists
2014-02-28 01:28:35	tac	Couldn't you say that a "forgetful" functor is one with a left adjoint
2014-02-28 01:28:39	Cale	dwcook: Given a forgetful functor (which we pick intuitively), if it has a left adjoint, that is called a free functor.
2014-02-28 01:28:41	tac	That's how I think of it at least
2014-02-28 01:28:54	tac	(Although some functors have both left and right adjoints, so you can have a functor that's both free and forgetful)
2014-02-28 01:28:56	Cale	tac: Well, you could... sometimes that can be a bit weird as well.
2014-02-28 01:29:23	imprimable	an adjunction between two poset is a galois connection
2014-02-28 01:29:28	imprimable	you doesn't forget anything there
2014-02-28 01:29:33	imprimable	so i doubt such definition is "legit
2014-02-28 01:29:34	imprimable	"
2014-02-28 01:29:47	Cale	imprimable: You do kind of...
2014-02-28 01:29:54	imprimable	you do ?
2014-02-28 01:30:05	Cale	But it's a really abstract sort of "forgetting"
2014-02-28 01:30:07	Cale	:)
2014-02-28 01:30:09	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 01:30:15	imprimable	what does it forget then
2014-02-28 01:30:16	imprimable	some elements ?
2014-02-28 01:30:17	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 01:31:35	Cale	Well, you have to look at particular examples of Galois connections for that to make sense, I think, but if you go back and forth via a Galois connection, you don't end up where you started, you lose a certain amount of information.
2014-02-28 01:31:50	imprimable	well thats because its the concept of adjunction
2014-02-28 01:31:57	imprimable	a weakening of inverse
2014-02-28 01:32:14	imprimable	the pair of functor that are the "closest" to being inverse of each other
2014-02-28 01:33:51	Cale	Well, if you go back and forth, you get a sort of "closure" or "interior" operator, depending on the way that you do it.
2014-02-28 01:34:38	Cale	(That's by analogy with the closure/interior on the poset of subsets of a topological space)
2014-02-28 01:35:28	imprimable	hm so you still lose "some" structure
2014-02-28 01:35:30	Cale	There's a map from the poset of subsets of a topological space to the poset of open sets, which takes each set to its interior
2014-02-28 01:36:51	Cale	and there's a map going the other way which forgets that an open set was open, just considering it as a subset of the topological space
2014-02-28 01:38:03	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 01:38:04	imprimable	i ee
2014-02-28 01:38:07	imprimable	i see
2014-02-28 01:39:49	Cale	actually, that's kind of a poor example, because it feels more like we're being forgetful in the other direction ;)
2014-02-28 01:40:04	Cale	I should have gone with closure :)
2014-02-28 01:40:40	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 01:40:56	Cale	of course, it's the same thing if you invert the sense of the poset
2014-02-28 01:41:11	Cale	But usually you think of the poset of inclusion maps
2014-02-28 01:41:15	imprimable	ye
2014-02-28 01:41:22	imprimable	s
2014-02-28 01:41:55	Cale	and here, the correspondence says that if U is a subset of int X, then |U| is a subset of X
2014-02-28 01:42:42	Cale	(where the bars denote what is usually thought of as the identity map, but we're forgetting that U was open)
2014-02-28 01:42:56	Cale	So, in this case |-| is left adjoint to interior
2014-02-28 01:43:48	-->	cads (~m@24-159-101-83.dhcp.gwnt.ga.charter.com) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-28 01:44:19	Cale	but the closure works the other way, if we have that cl X is a subset of K, then X is a subset of |K|, where this time K belongs to the poset of closed subsets of the topology
2014-02-28 01:45:50	Cale	So closure is left adjoint to forgetting that a subset was closed
2014-02-28 01:47:00	Cale	and well, I've called it the closure here, but what is actually the closure is a map between subsets of the topological space, so you're doing a composition of these two functors, taking the closure, and then forgetting.
2014-02-28 01:47:06	Cale	That's a monad
2014-02-28 01:48:07	Cale	and the unit for the monad says that X is a subset of |cl X|
2014-02-28 01:48:27	Cale	and the multiplication for it says that |cl |cl X|| is a subset of |cl X|
2014-02-28 01:50:04	Cale	Or, you know, you can drop all the bars, since they're do-nothing in this case anyway, and it starts to look a bit affected :)
2014-02-28 02:15:43	dwcook	nlab doesn't seem to have an entry for "applicative"; is there another name for this in CT or it just not an interesting concept in general?

2014-02-28 04:24:15	imprimable	i have a question
2014-02-28 04:24:39	imprimable	it looks like category theory is able to have an algebraization of integers, real and so on
2014-02-28 04:24:54	imprimable	can analysis (ie, measure theory for example) be entirely "algebraized" with cat theory ?
2014-02-28 04:27:33	Cale	imprimable: It's not trivial. It's something that people are looking at and working on. There's not always an easy way to take something defined in terms of structured sets and characterise it precisely through the properties and relationships that such structures have with each other.
2014-02-28 04:27:45	Cale	But it's definitely worth doing to the extent that we can do it.
2014-02-28 04:28:00	imprimable	its really really deep
2014-02-28 04:28:19	imprimable	its like philosophically speaking
2014-02-28 04:28:26	imprimable	it "proves" what physics is telling us
2014-02-28 04:28:31	imprimable	"everything is relational"
2014-02-28 04:28:35	imprimable	"object doesn't matter"
2014-02-28 04:28:36	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 04:28:51	Cale	Well, hmm
2014-02-28 04:29:49	imprimable	even geometry has to be relational if you think about quantum gravity !
2014-02-28 04:30:05	imprimable	it is "supposed" that geometry is emerging from relations in quantum gravity
2014-02-28 04:30:11	imprimable	you have many good reasons to believe it
2014-02-28 04:31:43	Cale	We'd always love to have both sides to any picture. There's the side of geometry coming from Euclid (and Hilbert and others doing more modern and correct versions) which axiomatically introduces points and lines, and what relationships those things are meant to have, and then there's geometry in the style of Descartes, which reduces points to coordinate tuples, and lines to sets of points.
2014-02-28 04:31:58	Cale	and there are benefits to both approaches
2014-02-28 04:32:46	imprimable	well what i'm saying is : from a fundational point of view, all of those things are emerging from relations
2014-02-28 04:32:47	Cale	But it can be very painful not to have the first sort of approach to something -- you want to be able to give this sort of synthetic characterisation of what you're talking about.
2014-02-28 04:33:14	imprimable	sure it might be clearer and easier way to understand what it means
2014-02-28 04:33:25	imprimable	but you can do without it
2014-02-28 04:33:48	Cale	and it's often *very* hard to figure out what that synthetic approach ought to be
2014-02-28 04:33:50	imprimable	so it is really deeper to "code" what it means to be a real or an intger algebraically
2014-02-28 04:34:10	Cale	I'm unaware of any really nice approach to real numbers, actually :P
2014-02-28 04:34:16	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 04:34:25	imprimable	seriously
2014-02-28 04:34:29	Cale	Well, okay, there's the complete ordered field thing
2014-02-28 04:34:33	imprimable	i'm more and more convinced that category theory has to be the new fundations of maths :>
2014-02-28 04:34:49	Cale	Well, okay, that's nice to say
2014-02-28 04:34:55	imprimable	ye, archimean and stuff
2014-02-28 04:35:57	tac	Category as foundations is interesting, but most mathematical writing is not written that way.
2014-02-28 04:36:22	imprimable	well, because historicaly category theory is too young in this respect
2014-02-28 04:36:25	Cale	and it's really hard in general to characterise the categories we want to work with via their global properties
2014-02-28 04:36:31	yogurt_truck	ct is very very young
2014-02-28 04:36:53	imprimable	but seriously, its really is much deeper than set theory
2014-02-28 04:36:59	imprimable	set theory emphasises elements
2014-02-28 04:37:02	imprimable	cat theory relations
2014-02-28 04:37:07	imprimable	relations is "one step deeper"
2014-02-28 04:37:23	tac	But do you really want and need deep for everything?
2014-02-28 04:37:36	imprimable	i want yes, in order to understand better what is mathematics
2014-02-28 04:37:44	imprimable	its really interesting in a pure maths view
2014-02-28 04:37:44	tac	The standard argument against any foundations is "that's not how math is actually done"
2014-02-28 04:37:59	Cale	imprimable: Well, I don't think anyone will disagree with you, but sometimes you don't understand the thing you're trying to study very deeply yet.
2014-02-28 04:38:30	imprimable	its not false tac, but thats only because there's not enough people to contruct on it
2014-02-28 04:38:52	Cale	ETCS is a thing, and it gives a sort of characterisation for what a category of sets ought to be
2014-02-28 04:39:02	Cale	That's actually remarkable
2014-02-28 04:39:11	imprimable	its striking yes
2014-02-28 04:39:18	Cale	If you replace "sets" with just about anything else, I don't know how to do that
2014-02-28 04:39:24	imprimable	it tells you that you only need relations
2014-02-28 04:39:32	imprimable	and from a philosophical perspective, as a physicist
2014-02-28 04:39:41	imprimable	i'm convinced that relations is what matters
2014-02-28 04:39:42	imprimable	for years
2014-02-28 04:39:52	imprimable	so cat theory is like "the place to do things"
2014-02-28 04:39:52	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 04:39:54	imprimable	the good framework
2014-02-28 04:39:57	Cale	Like, can you tell me what a category of groups is, without saying what a group is?
2014-02-28 04:40:03	imprimable	well
2014-02-28 04:40:09	imprimable	the catgory of group object inside a category
2014-02-28 04:40:11	imprimable	i can tell you
2014-02-28 04:40:19	imprimable	otherwise i don't know
2014-02-28 04:40:38	imprimable	maybe one has to look for "the category of category" without sets
2014-02-28 04:40:44	imprimable	and the category of group would be "by chance"
2014-02-28 04:40:52	imprimable	the category of group objects of such category
2014-02-28 04:41:04	imprimable	so you wouldn't need any set theory there
2014-02-28 04:41:09	Cale	Yeah, or indeed, can you characterise Cat via its large-scale properties?
2014-02-28 04:41:14	imprimable	no idea
2014-02-28 04:41:15	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 04:41:31	imprimable	but those questions are fascinating
2014-02-28 04:41:31	Cale	(i.e. without saying specifically what a functor is, but instead giving properties of the category as a whole)
2014-02-28 04:42:27	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@46-129-91-177.dynamic.upc.nl) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-28 04:42:31	tac	If you try to fit everything into your theory of categories, doesn't that remind you a little about a guy who tries to solve all his problems with his hammer?
2014-02-28 04:42:36	Cale	The fact that this is hard is why category theory usually has made a better theory for studying our structures after the fact, rather than building them in the first place.
2014-02-28 04:42:44	tac	Sometimes, categories are not the right fit for a problem.
2014-02-28 04:43:09	imprimable	well tac, if you take category theory as a new foundation for maths
2014-02-28 04:43:12	imprimable	it "should" be enough
2014-02-28 04:43:21	imprimable	unless one finds  an even deeper framework
2014-02-28 04:43:49	Cale	Set theory has a lot of disadvantages, but one great big advantage: it's been easy to encode many things in terms of sets, even if it's been completely intolerable to actually work with them formally in our set theories.
2014-02-28 04:44:09	tac	the nice thing is you don't work formally with sets most often
2014-02-28 04:44:11	imprimable	yes, its simple because it emphasises elements/objects
2014-02-28 04:44:23	tac	You learn the tricks you need to fudge your theorems
2014-02-28 04:44:23	imprimable	and its easier for us as human being
2014-02-28 04:44:30	Cale	and that's critical for anything you're going to take as a foundations
2014-02-28 04:44:47	tac	In algebra, for instance, you often have to keep in mind things are only isomorphic instead of equivalent
2014-02-28 04:44:50	imprimable	maybe we have to wait 10000 years, when our brain will be more evolved for that ;)
2014-02-28 04:44:55	tac	You prove your theorems and the world keeps on turning
2014-02-28 04:45:16	Cale	(or instead of equal)
2014-02-28 04:45:36	imprimable	yes but you're "cheating" tac
2014-02-28 04:45:39	imprimable	in the sense that you do it outside maths
2014-02-28 04:45:54	imprimable	its you who is understanding it the good way
2014-02-28 04:45:55	imprimable	not the theory
2014-02-28 04:46:13	tac	The interesting part almost never depends on splitting hairs over equality and isomorphism.
2014-02-28 04:46:31	Cale	Well, I'm not sure I'd be willing to say you're doing it outside maths, but certainly, the translation into the formalism is so tedious that it's very hard to get people to bring themselves to actually do it.
2014-02-28 04:46:49	tac	And if it does, you are usually careful to invent a notation for it, or to remind your audience that you have to keep in mind some extra "understood" details (like what group structure or topology lives on a well-known set)
2014-02-28 04:47:19	tac	Formalism is done in degrees. An full formalization is often a barrier to understanding.
2014-02-28 04:47:23	Cale	There's a metalanguage built on top of that which is quite reasonably justified, but has been fairly informal.
2014-02-28 04:47:40	imprimable	Cale: which means your theory is not strong enough to speak about that
2014-02-28 04:47:44	tac	If you look at any computer program, for instance, the thing the program actually does is often very very small compared to the "boilerplate" code you need to get it to work
2014-02-28 04:47:59	--	[mth]_away is now known as [mth]
2014-02-28 04:48:12	imprimable	sure tac i agree that formalization is not always a good thing and that it can obscure meaning
2014-02-28 04:48:15	tac	Boilerplate in a typical application vastly outweighs the core of your program.
2014-02-28 04:48:15	imprimable	but here its different
2014-02-28 04:48:25	Cale	HoTT is exciting precisely because it has the capacity to formally capture these notions of isomorphism and let us uniformly transport theorems and constructions through them.
2014-02-28 04:48:25	tac	It's not at all different
2014-02-28 04:48:45	Cale	So, there's a very real hope that maybe it will be tolerable to use it directly.
2014-02-28 04:48:45	imprimable	what you usually "think" in set theory and is not contained inside set theory looks like it is from scratch contained in cat theory
2014-02-28 04:48:49	tac	But even in HoTT, you have to keep in mind the distinction between judgmental and propositional equality, which can be obnoxious :)
2014-02-28 04:49:03	imprimable	i see Cale
2014-02-28 04:49:07	imprimable	so you would take HoTT as new fundations
2014-02-28 04:49:10	imprimable	rather than cat theory ?
2014-02-28 04:49:22	 *	tac tends to think in terms of something vaguely hott-like
2014-02-28 04:49:34	ystael	case in point, exercise 5.2 :p
2014-02-28 04:49:43	tac	ystael: which one is that?
2014-02-28 04:49:48	Cale	imprimable: Category theory doesn't even attempt to be foundational, in itself. There have been attempts at foundations through category-like structures.
2014-02-28 04:50:07	ystael	tac: Find two functions on N which obey the same recurrence (thus are propositionally equal), but are not judgmentally equal.
2014-02-28 04:50:35	Cale	imprimable: But the definition of a category isn't one that you can even state in a first-order logic sort of setting, and even if you could, getting yourself off the ground to do anything interesting is pretty tricky.
2014-02-28 04:50:47	tac	like \x => 0 + x and id?
2014-02-28 04:51:02	imprimable	so its in some sense not the good language but the good "algebraic framework" ?
2014-02-28 04:51:08	tac	err other way around, I suppose, if you've defined + recursive on the left
2014-02-28 04:51:09	imprimable	the good philosophy
2014-02-28 04:51:15	Cale	imprimable: yes
2014-02-28 04:51:25	imprimable	and HoTT is better as a language to express things formaly ?
2014-02-28 04:51:33	ystael	tac: Maybe, yeah.  I had been thinking 'suc' and 'n + 1', which is basically the same idea
2014-02-28 04:51:47	Cale	imprimable: and HoTT wouldn't exist in the shape that it does if it weren't for the influence of CT throughout
2014-02-28 04:51:50	tac	Logic is the slipperiest of slopes. It's best you not go looking for the Ultimate Theory, because there is none.
2014-02-28 04:52:01	tac	Instead, remember that mathematics is done by people, and a proof is something that convinces your peers.
2014-02-28 04:52:07	imprimable	damn, you gonna convince me to stuyd HoTT now Cale
2014-02-28 04:52:13	tac	The thing that sets mathematics appart from other sciences is that your peers are more pedantic :)
2014-02-28 04:52:30	--	[mth] is now known as [mth]_away
2014-02-28 04:52:51	imprimable	tac: there's not one "Ultimate Theory"
2014-02-28 04:53:00	imprimable	but i think that there are different layers of "meaning"
2014-02-28 04:53:03	Cale	There are things about the present situation in HoTT which worry me though. I hope that they get solved.
2014-02-28 04:53:10	imprimable	that are deep and deeper
2014-02-28 04:53:18	ystael	Cale: ?
2014-02-28 04:53:35	Cale	Well, they worry everyone, I think :)
2014-02-28 04:53:39	tac	Cale: I have the same feeling.
2014-02-28 04:53:52	Cale	Presently, to get anywhere in HoTT, we need to define new types, especially higher inductive types. But what are the rules for constructing those?
2014-02-28 04:54:07	tac	indeed
2014-02-28 04:54:20	Cale	It's not even clear what sorts of higher inductive definitions are admissible.
2014-02-28 04:54:30	Cale	Let alone how to compute with them
2014-02-28 04:54:54	Cale	Everyone sort of has an idea of what's sensible
2014-02-28 04:55:21	Cale	but as far as I've seen, nobody's actually written down an attempt to formalise what's okay there
2014-02-28 04:55:26	tac	When I toy with the idea of designing a language, one of the big problems is "How do data declarations work?"
2014-02-28 04:56:00	tac	I'd rather avoid the Coq and Agda-style inductive definitions, because they give you a really f-ing complicated axiom schema
2014-02-28 04:56:21	tac	And even for those, we don't know how to make induction laws work in all cases
2014-02-28 04:56:27	Cale	I would be really happy with something like a higher-inductive version of W
2014-02-28 04:56:36	tac	(and M!)
2014-02-28 04:56:59	tac	I think even if HoTT in its present form doesn't quite work, there are enough Good Ideas that _something_ will eventually come out of it
2014-02-28 04:57:08	Cale	(Is M the coinductive version of W?)
2014-02-28 04:57:13	tac	Yes
2014-02-28 04:57:22	Cale	Yes, HoTT is too good an idea to fail
2014-02-28 04:57:30	Cale	The only question is how well it will succeed
2014-02-28 04:58:18	tac	Intuitively at least, I find it to be a lot simpler than set theory
2014-02-28 04:58:23	imprimable	what is HoTT trying to succeed ?
2014-02-28 04:58:53	tac	I think Cale means "succeed" in the sense that people will still care about it 100 years from now
2014-02-28 04:59:16	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 04:59:19	tac	and that it will be a major theory ever graduate in topology needs to learn about
2014-02-28 04:59:42	tac	Voevodsky's program has the same sort of spirit as Hilbert's program in the 1900s
2014-02-28 04:59:51	imprimable	and some godel guy will come and ruin it ?
2014-02-28 04:59:52	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 04:59:54	tac	and in fact... is almost literally the same, except we have computers now
2014-02-28 05:00:07	tac	Godel showed the world Hilbert was overly optimistic
2014-02-28 05:00:29	tac	(and on top of that, Hilbert didn't consider anything about complexity theory and the time it would take for a 'computer' to solve a problem)
2014-02-28 05:00:48	imprimable	so HoTT is a formalist approach to mathematics ?
2014-02-28 05:00:51	imprimable	in the sense of computing
2014-02-28 05:00:53	imprimable	computation
2014-02-28 05:00:59	tac	But now that we have computers and we have such a massive body of mathematical theory, it would be nice to know that you can verify your mathematics both in principle and __literally__
2014-02-28 05:01:05	tac	yes
2014-02-28 05:01:08	imprimable	ok i see
2014-02-28 05:01:22	imprimable	what about incompleteness ?
2014-02-28 05:01:28	tac	HoTT is actually implemented both in Coq and Agda (although both are kluges)
2014-02-28 05:01:37	Cale	imprimable: You hope for incompleteness :)
2014-02-28 05:01:50	tac	Incompleteness is just something you live with
2014-02-28 05:01:50	imprimable	well, incompleteness is everywhere
2014-02-28 05:01:54	imprimable	i know
2014-02-28 05:01:55	imprimable	thats why
2014-02-28 05:01:59	tac	Incompleteness says that you can't brute force every problem
2014-02-28 05:02:02	imprimable	how does HoTT "behave" with that
2014-02-28 05:02:11	tac	But we're not trying to brute force problems
2014-02-28 05:02:37	tac	Coq and Agda allow you to have a computer check your proof for correctness
2014-02-28 05:02:42	tac	But you have to supply the proof
2014-02-28 05:02:43	Cale	imprimable: Well, one thing can be said. HoTT starts out with a constructive foundation for mathematics
2014-02-28 05:02:47	tac	(possibly with machine assistance)
2014-02-28 05:02:55	imprimable	(which is good Cale, for me at least)
2014-02-28 05:03:13	Cale	and in particular, it's one where "A or not A" is not something that you globally take to be true
2014-02-28 05:03:24	imprimable	so its intuitionistic
2014-02-28 05:03:27	Cale	yes
2014-02-28 05:03:28	imprimable	is it "finitist" too ?
2014-02-28 05:03:30	Cale	no
2014-02-28 05:03:32	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 05:03:54	tac	"A or not A" is actually something you can neither prove nor disprove (for a certain mild restriction on A)
2014-02-28 05:04:34	tac	A or not A (the (-1)-trancated version) is actually independent in the sense of the continuum hypothesis
2014-02-28 05:04:35	Cale	"Pi A:U, A + not A" is inconsistent with univalence, in fact
2014-02-28 05:05:04	Cale	So, trying in a ham-handed way to make the law of excluded middle hold will ruin HoTT
2014-02-28 05:05:04	imprimable	yes as in intuitionistic logic
2014-02-28 05:05:18	imprimable	well thats the differenc between truth and provability
2014-02-28 05:05:20	tac	Cale: Something I noticed, but I haven't had time to check... I think if you put restrictions on LEM to sets, there's no contradiction
2014-02-28 05:05:23	Cale	Well, in intuitionistic logic, it's simply left open
2014-02-28 05:05:28	imprimable	but in this world, only what is provable is accessible to us so
2014-02-28 05:05:33	Cale	tac: Right, there isn't.
2014-02-28 05:05:41	tac	Cale: The proof in the book says that LEM is inconsistent because Type is not a set, iirc. But Type isn't a Type.
2014-02-28 05:05:54	Cale	uh
2014-02-28 05:07:43	Cale	Well, LEM will force all types to be sets.
2014-02-28 05:08:17	tac	right
2014-02-28 05:08:43	tac	As long as you don't assume any HIT's (at the Type_0 level), then I don't _think_ the standard proof breaks things
2014-02-28 05:08:43	Cale	LEM_infinity will, I should say
2014-02-28 05:09:00	tac	right. LEM_infinity obviously doesn't work with Univalence
2014-02-28 05:09:04	Cale	Not the good version of LEM :)
2014-02-28 05:09:13	Cale	The good version of LEM won't spoil anything
2014-02-28 05:09:24	tac	But if you wanted to do classical math, but still have access to univalence, I think LEM for Type is admissible
2014-02-28 05:09:48	tac	LEM_0 : forall a : Type_0. a + ~a
2014-02-28 05:09:55	tac	that should be fine, I think
2014-02-28 05:10:27	Cale	I think so as well, yes
2014-02-28 05:10:43	tac	So then you could do all the standard mathematics without having to worry about the weirdness that intuitinistic logic brings
2014-02-28 05:10:58	imprimable	is HoTT also "relational" as category theory ?
2014-02-28 05:10:58	tac	but then, you can also appeal to univalence
2014-02-28 05:11:08	tac	what do you mean by relational?
2014-02-28 05:11:08	imprimable	(ie functional ?)
2014-02-28 05:11:18	imprimable	it emphasises relations/functions
2014-02-28 05:11:19	tac	what do you mean by functional? :)
2014-02-28 05:11:21	imprimable	rather than "object/elements"
2014-02-28 05:11:23	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 05:11:31	imprimable	how could i say that
2014-02-28 05:11:31	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 05:11:36	tac	It actually does have a distinguished notion of object/element
2014-02-28 05:11:41	Cale	Wait, does that follow from LEM_-1?
2014-02-28 05:11:43	tac	but an element belongs to a single type
2014-02-28 05:11:47	Cale	(i.e. the usual LEM?)
2014-02-28 05:12:02	tac	How would it follow from LEM_-1?
2014-02-28 05:12:06	Cale	hmm
2014-02-28 05:12:45	tac	imprimable: so a "subset" isn't literally just a set containing fewer elements than its parent. Instead, it's a set together with a distinguished way to embed that set into a bigger one
2014-02-28 05:13:02	imprimable	and this "dinstinguished way" is a "function"
2014-02-28 05:13:03	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-28 05:13:09	tac	yep
2014-02-28 05:13:14	tac	more precisely, an injection
2014-02-28 05:13:17	imprimable	yes
2014-02-28 05:13:21	-->	conehead (~conehead@unaffiliated/conehead) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-28 05:13:24	imprimable	so its relational i guess
2014-02-28 05:13:30	imprimable	it tells you "how" objects are related
2014-02-28 05:13:35	imprimable	more than what they are
2014-02-28 05:14:08	tac	I would agree with that
2014-02-28 05:14:16	imprimable	so HoTT could be a nice framework to do physics too
2014-02-28 05:14:21	imprimable	as topos theoy could be in cat theory
2014-02-28 05:14:24	imprimable	right ?
2014-02-28 05:15:06	tac	HoTT also "does category theory" in a pretty nice way
2014-02-28 05:15:14	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 05:15:16	imprimable	question
2014-02-28 05:15:20	imprimable	what should i do to understand it ?
2014-02-28 05:15:21	imprimable	:}}
2014-02-28 05:15:22	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 05:15:28	tac	For instance, a category in HoTT has the principle that isomorphic objects are literally equal
2014-02-28 05:15:48	tac	There's the book: http://homotopytypetheory.org/book
2014-02-28 05:15:53	tac	It's a bit rough, though
2014-02-28 05:16:04	imprimable	yes but i'm not a mathematician nor a computer scientist
2014-02-28 05:16:15	imprimable	i don't even know what type theory is yet
2014-02-28 05:16:17	tac	You can get familiar with Agda or Coq, too, but those are probably tough routes as well
2014-02-28 05:16:32	imprimable	oh, so i need to "code" to get familiar with HoTT ?
2014-02-28 05:16:42	tac	Or you can wait a few months and see if I find the time to publish a book or a blog on type theory during my sabbatical :)
2014-02-28 05:16:49	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 05:16:50	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 05:16:51	imprimable	:>
2014-02-28 05:17:00	tac	I'm of the opinion that coding is helpful to understand it, but shouldn't be required
2014-02-28 05:17:07	tac	The book, in particular, is written in an "informal" style
2014-02-28 05:17:20	imprimable	because basically
2014-02-28 05:17:28	tac	But type theory's history is heavily tied with computer science
2014-02-28 05:17:34	imprimable	i have the maths skill of a good undergraduate in maths but thats it
2014-02-28 05:17:34	Cale	tac: Oh wait, maybe that's like global choice
2014-02-28 05:17:39	Cale	tac: hah
2014-02-28 05:17:46	imprimable	so i don't know if i can understand those things
2014-02-28 05:17:47	tac	Global choice?
2014-02-28 05:18:00	Cale	tac: You're picking an element from every nonempty set A
2014-02-28 05:18:16	tac	yeah
2014-02-28 05:18:41	Cale	So, yeah, I'd be willing to believe that's consistent, but it's definitely more powerful than LEM
2014-02-28 05:18:52	Cale	Is it more powerful than AC here?
2014-02-28 05:18:54	tac	that LEM_-1 you mean?
2014-02-28 05:18:57	Cale	right
2014-02-28 05:19:01	tac	oh definitely
2014-02-28 05:19:13	Cale	I think it's about as powerful as AC in the next universe up
2014-02-28 05:19:15	tac	I think there should be a modified AoC that is more powerful than it
2014-02-28 05:19:36	tac	But the AC in the book (the one that is provable in MLTT) is a little weaker because AoC has a hypothesis
2014-02-28 05:19:59	tac	And the hypothesis's strength influenecs the strength of the theorem overall
2014-02-28 05:20:06	Cale	The one that's provable in MLTT is not worthy of being called AC
2014-02-28 05:20:07	--	[mth]_away is now known as [mth]
2014-02-28 05:20:15	Cale	I'm talking about the one which is actually an axiom :)
2014-02-28 05:20:15	tac	I agree
2014-02-28 05:20:40	Cale	(well, okay, there are lots of those, but there's one in particular which the book focuses on)
2014-02-28 05:20:50	tac	right, I know the one
2014-02-28 05:21:17	imprimable	guys, may i ask you what you're working and what's your background before you studied HoTT ? (or was it natural ?)
2014-02-28 05:21:25	imprimable	+on
2014-02-28 05:21:45	tac	Computer Science.
2014-02-28 05:21:57	tac	I came from Haskell -> Agda -> HoTT
2014-02-28 05:22:15	imprimable	so its the computation power of HoTT that is interesting you tac ?
2014-02-28 05:22:33	tac	Computability is nice to have
2014-02-28 05:22:41	tac	(LEM_0 would break computability, of course, Cale)
2014-02-28 05:22:50	Cale	imprimable: I have an undergraduate degree in pure mathematics from the university of Waterloo, and I've been programming in Haskell for around 12 years. I recently discovered that this means that I already kind of knew how to program in Coq and Agda (or at least, I can mash keys on my keyboard until things turn blue).
2014-02-28 05:23:05	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 05:23:06	Cale	tac: LEM_(-1) already does
2014-02-28 05:23:13	tac	does it really?
2014-02-28 05:23:23	Cale	yep
2014-02-28 05:23:35	tac	I mean, props are proof-irrelevant, aren't they? You can just ignore them in a program, can't you?
2014-02-28 05:23:48	imprimable	so why are you learning HoTT for Cale ? what are the questions you're interested in ?
2014-02-28 05:24:01	Cale	tac: Oh, maybe.
2014-02-28 05:24:27	tac	... but then there's that whole thing about how truncation doesn't hide information that I don't quite understand yet...
2014-02-28 05:24:47	Cale	tac: But presumably you can inspect that sum
2014-02-28 05:25:00	Cale	tac: and then LEM has to come up with whether it's inl or inr, and can't
2014-02-28 05:25:16	tac	hmm
2014-02-28 05:25:35	tac	But you always have to "stick it back in a truncated type"
2014-02-28 05:25:43	tac	Like a monad you can't escape from
2014-02-28 05:25:50	Cale	imprimable: I'm interested in a lot of aspects of it. I've been a fan of homotopy theory for a long time. I'm interested in foundations of mathematics. I'm also interested in computer science and programming languages.
2014-02-28 05:26:05	imprimable	fair enough :>
2014-02-28 05:26:26	imprimable	did you heard about the theory of derivator from grothendieck ?
2014-02-28 05:26:32	imprimable	i think there he tried to formalize what homotopy is
2014-02-28 05:26:35	Cale	tac: Well, it's Pi (A:U), isProp(A) -> (A + not A)
2014-02-28 05:27:55	Cale	imprimable: I'm not that far along in my understanding of homotopy theory
2014-02-28 05:28:35	Cale	imprimable: But I've heard about various approaches to abstract homotopy theory. This is something that people have been attacking since long before HoTT
2014-02-28 05:28:50	Cale	(HoTT is simply the newest exciting approach to it)
2014-02-28 05:28:59	imprimable	yes, a better "language" as you told me
2014-02-28 05:29:00	ystael	Cale: also something yesterday on the homotopytypetheory list about how homotopy type theory is also representation theory? o_O
2014-02-28 05:29:01	imprimable	i understand
2014-02-28 05:29:37	Cale	ystael: wat
2014-02-28 05:30:24	ystael	let me find the message
2014-02-28 05:30:33	Cale	Yeah, I didn't see that one somehow
2014-02-28 05:30:46	ystael	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/homotopytypetheory/dwo93Z2MNqM Urs Schreiber, third from bottom
2014-02-28 05:30:53	Cale	I'm subscribed to the digest, and sometimes I miss things
2014-02-28 05:31:59	Cale	oh, okay, I did see that, but I didn't really understand it :)
2014-02-28 05:32:13	tac	what is representation theory in this context?
2014-02-28 05:32:19	Cale	We should generally expect that HoTT has lots of interesting models
2014-02-28 05:33:25	ystael	tac: I certainly don't know enough to say :)
2014-02-28 05:33:27	Cale	apparently in this case, it's the representation theory of infinity groups
2014-02-28 05:33:30	--	[mth] is now known as [mth]_away
2014-02-28 05:34:11	ystael	.. if i had any idea what an infinity group was
2014-02-28 05:34:27	tomprince	imprimable: You won't know if you can understand something until you try. And, having tried, you would then have some idea of what else you might need to learn before understanding.
2014-02-28 05:35:02	Cale	ystael: Well, it's a pointed connected infinity groupoid
2014-02-28 05:35:52	Cale	ystael: Which if we're taking HoTT seriously, is the same thing as a pointed connected type. :)
2014-02-28 05:36:26	ystael	I don't think I understand yet what it means for a type to be connected (isn't a path connected type automatically contractible?)
2014-02-28 05:36:41	<--	dwcook (~danny@unaffiliated/dwcook) has quit (Quit: \o)
2014-02-28 05:37:01	Cale	If you don't truncate
2014-02-28 05:37:02	tomprince	No. Not necesairly (if you have HIT).
2014-02-28 05:37:26	tomprince	The circle type, for example, isn't contractible (despite having only a single element)
2014-02-28 05:37:45	Cale	If you just write Pi (x,y : A), x = y, that ensures that A is contractible
2014-02-28 05:37:51	-->	Pedro__ (~Pedro@177.32.82.70) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-02-28 05:37:55	Cale	but Pi (x,y : A), ||x = y|| doesn't
2014-02-28 05:38:05	ystael	oh, "connected" is the word for truncated version?
2014-02-28 05:38:08	Cale	yes
2014-02-28 05:38:20	imprimable	tomprince: yes i know, but i don't want to try "in the air"
2014-02-28 05:38:22	imprimable	to lose time
2014-02-28 05:38:47	imprimable	again, i like doing thingin the ""correct"" order
2014-02-28 05:38:47	imprimable	ahah
2014-02-28 05:38:55	ystael	i very do not understand the effect and moral meaning of truncation yet
2014-02-28 05:38:58	tac	tomprince: I would argue that the circle doesn't have just one element :)
2014-02-28 05:39:09	tac	The notion of "how many elements" is not a particularly well-defined notion, even
2014-02-28 05:39:44	tomprince	imprimable: I think you are "losing time", by trying to do things in the "correct order", particularly since you are asking people who don't know your background well what they thing the "correct order" is.
2014-02-28 05:39:47	Cale	ystael: Well, morally, it means that there is a path x = y, but you don't have to make a choice of which path that is which is continuous in x and y
2014-02-28 05:39:47	tac	"How many elements" is perhaps best restricted to countable discrete types.
2014-02-28 05:40:08	tomprince	tac: Sure. But there is a circle type with a single element that isn't contractible.
2014-02-28 05:40:27	tac	Does that mean the interval has two elements?
2014-02-28 05:40:38	tac	well, if you add that contractible word there :)
2014-02-28 05:40:41	ystael	Cale: Ah, I think that was the moral implication I was missing, that when you don't truncate you are insisting on continuity all the way through
2014-02-28 05:40:44	Cale	tac: What's an element?
2014-02-28 05:40:48	imprimable	tomprince: thats true, but my maths level is really weak compared to someone who went to graduate school in maths and stuff
2014-02-28 05:41:00	tomprince	imprimable: So?
2014-02-28 05:41:03	imprimable	for example, i have no knowledge in homotopy theory,e tc
2014-02-28 05:41:24	imprimable	well, i'm afraid to "miss the point"
2014-02-28 05:41:34	imprimable	like, if you start learning analysis with measure theory
2014-02-28 05:41:39	imprimable	or topology
2014-02-28 05:41:41	imprimable	sure it can work
2014-02-28 05:41:51	imprimable	but i doubt you will understand why its a better way
2014-02-28 05:42:12	tomprince	So?
2014-02-28 05:42:16	imprimable	aha
2014-02-28 05:42:21	Cale	ystael: Yeah, Pi (x:A), P(x) is to be thought of as the type of (continuous) sections of a fibration whose fibre at x in A is P(x)
2014-02-28 05:42:22	imprimable	i don't want to "miss the point" ? ;>
2014-02-28 05:42:46	tomprince	You can always go back and learn what you missed. Even assuming there is a "the point".
2014-02-28 05:42:49	tac	Well if you sit on your hands instead of trying, you're pretty much guaranteed to miss any and all points.
2014-02-28 05:43:07	Cale	(but that may or may not be a helpful description for you, depending on your background :)
2014-02-28 05:43:18	imprimable	thats true tomprince, but i better know the "must do" before trying something that would be too hard for me
2014-02-28 05:43:35	Cale	It's so weird how HoTT has brought together people in such a way that everyone can feel stupid
2014-02-28 05:43:51	ystael	Cale: I think I'm getting to the point where I need to go back and learn homotopy theory for real to shed more light on the motivations under HoTT.  I can't just power through the stack of symbols, I need the motivation, and my background is more math than CS
2014-02-28 05:44:10	ystael	hahaha, that's exactly right :D
2014-02-28 05:44:13	Saizan	mh, would it be ok to do non-parametric stuff in a function of type Pi (x:U), P(x) ?
2014-02-28 05:44:20	ystael	(well, I would feel stupid anyway)
2014-02-28 05:44:25	tomprince	imprimable: You might as well give up, if you aren't willing to try things that might be too hard for you.
2014-02-28 05:44:25	tac	ystael: I feel the same way sometimes.
2014-02-28 05:44:39	tac	ystael: (I personally feel the CS perspective to type theory is kind of shallow)
2014-02-28 05:44:42	imprimable	tomprince: no i mean, too hard without the knowledge of some theory i need to learn FIRST
2014-02-28 05:44:48	imprimable	i won't give up :>
2014-02-28 05:45:20	ystael	Like in Chapter 4 I _kinda_ caught the topoogical motivations behind what was going on but I really felt my lack of acquaintance with homotopy equivalences
2014-02-28 05:45:31	Cale	imprimable: If you don't feel at least a bit "at sea" while learning, then you're probably not learning as quickly as you could be. But yeah, it's daunting in this case because there's a *lot* of background material which could potentially help you to understand what's going on in HoTT

2014-02-28 05:45:51	Cale	but that background material comes from many different areas of mathematics and computer science
2014-02-28 05:46:00	imprimable	and it doesn't from physics
2014-02-28 05:46:01	imprimable	ahah

2014-02-28 05:46:27	ystael	I feel like getting up to speed with the background for HoTT is a graduate degree by itself :)
2014-02-28 05:46:36	Cale	I know there are people who are working on mathematical physics in a way which intersects higher category theory
2014-02-28 05:46:48	imprimable	sure Cale, baez and stuff
2014-02-28 05:46:52	Cale	right
2014-02-28 05:46:53	imprimable	but they are alone
2014-02-28 05:46:55	imprimable	they are 10 at most
2014-02-28 05:46:57	Cale	Not entirely!
2014-02-28 05:47:13	Cale	haha, well, I don't know their number, but it seems like more than 10 to me
2014-02-28 05:47:15	imprimable	physicists are "missing the point" of category theory, precisely !
2014-02-28 05:47:43	Cale	There are whole conferences you can watch on YouTube on TQFTs and such
2014-02-28 05:47:49	imprimable	yes and AQFT
2014-02-28 05:47:57	imprimable	but those people are also "alone" in the physics community
2014-02-28 05:48:06	tomprince	imprimable: It is ins't like mathematics is simply-connected or partially ordered. There is no *first*. I've found I've benefited by approaching things in a "backwards" manner.
2014-02-28 05:48:08	Cale	Well, depends on your definition I suppose
2014-02-28 05:48:22	imprimable	tomprince: really ? I feel it is partially ordered
2014-02-28 05:48:25	Cale	Higher category theory is also pretty small and new as a branch of mathematics
2014-02-28 05:48:40	ystael	imprimable: One of the reasons I dropped out of grad school is I had trouble making the transition from learning in a line to learning in a spiral
2014-02-28 05:48:50	tomprince	That having learned some things backwards, I've found some of things I've studied much easier than they would otherwise have been.
2014-02-28 05:49:05	ystael	It's still hard
2014-02-28 05:49:09	imprimable	yes but you "lost" time understanding the "next" theory (if i can say next)
2014-02-28 05:49:17	Cale	imprimable: One thing about mathematics, is that we're almost always proving implications between things.
2014-02-28 05:49:40	tomprince	imprimable: I bet that the total time to understanding was less than it would have otherwise have been. So no lost time.
2014-02-28 05:49:47	imprimable	i think "knowledge" (shall i say understanding ?) is a non commutative thing that is ordered
2014-02-28 05:50:08	imprimable	you can't understand X if you didnt od Y before
2014-02-28 05:50:10	imprimable	it doesnt commute
2014-02-28 05:50:11	Cale	and given that this is the case, if you're willing to accept the preconditions for a theorem, then you should be able to follow it through to its conclusion
2014-02-28 05:50:26	imprimable	yes but you would miss the point of it Cale i'm sure
2014-02-28 05:50:35	imprimable	you're jut doing a formal verification of the proof
2014-02-28 05:50:43	imprimable	you wouldn't be able to have the intuition of i
2014-02-28 05:50:44	imprimable	it
2014-02-28 05:50:46	Cale	In some cases, yes, but if you do that long enough, intuition will come
2014-02-28 05:51:49	tomprince	But sometimes, having done that formal verification without understanding, when you go back to start figuring out the bits that make it up, you acheive understanding of what those parts are *much* quicker than you would have if you had just tried to understand them first.
2014-02-28 05:52:02	Cale	Of course, there are good and bad ways to approach things. It doesn't always make sense to just start at the big theorem, and then gradually work your way toward more basic things
2014-02-28 05:52:12	Cale	But most mathematical topics stratify nicely
2014-02-28 05:52:30	Cale	into things that you don't have to understand the foundations for, because a new level of abstraction was reached
2014-02-28 05:52:50	imprimable	like measure theory and topology compared to real analysis ?
2014-02-28 05:52:52	Cale	(that's not to say you won't be hindered by not understanding the foundations)
2014-02-28 05:53:55	Cale	Yeah, you can prove lots of things about metric spaces without knowing too much about the real numbers to begin with (and then that knowledge can even be fed back to tell you things about the real numbers)
2014-02-28 05:54:12	imprimable	well this is true
2014-02-28 05:54:23	imprimable	but most books are written for people with a "linear" background
2014-02-28 05:54:40	imprimable	where the example are enlighting people who have the usual background
2014-02-28 05:54:43	Cale	Yeah, the problem with research areas is that nobody really knows the best way to present anything yet
2014-02-28 05:54:45	tomprince	imprimable: If you had spent all the time you've spent here asking whether you have enough background to tackle something trying to tackle them, you would be in a much better position to answer that question, as well as having at least the begining of understanding of those things.
2014-02-28 05:54:50	Cale	Or even necessarily a good way

2014-02-28 05:55:54	Cale	http://cale.yi.org/share/Brown%20-%20Topology%20and%20Groupoids.pdf -- here's a book I think I can safely recommend for topological background
2014-02-28 05:56:32	Cale	Full disclosure, I haven't actually read so much of it myself, but I've seen enough to know it takes the right approach overall.
2014-02-28 05:56:43	Cale	(and many books on homotopy theory I think don't do so)
2014-02-28 05:57:19	ystael	Cale: interesting, this is a first course in topology that takes the "homotopy theoretically modern" viewpoint!
2014-02-28 05:57:28	ystael	I had a typical "Kelley/Munkres" topology course
2014-02-28 05:57:31	imprimable	let me save it
2014-02-28 05:57:44	Cale	Yeah, everyone has been ignoring Brown for years, and he's been doing the right thing overall.
2014-02-28 05:57:49	ystael	well, good for an analyst, which is what I thought I was goign to be :)
2014-02-28 05:58:22	Cale	(that's not entirely true, but his approach deserves way more attention and respect than it's gotten)
2014-02-28 05:58:30	Cale	But I think people are coming around to it generally :)
2014-02-28 05:58:36	Cale	Groupoids are important!
2014-02-28 05:59:29	tac	imprimable: Research is just that. You have to figure out how to learn the things you want to know about.
2014-02-28 05:59:39	Cale	imprimable: For the computer science part... well, hmm.
2014-02-28 05:59:50	imprimable	tac: yes i know, but here i'm asking "standard things" right ?
2014-02-28 05:59:57	tac	Cale: I bought Topology and Groupoids on your recommendation
2014-02-28 06:00:06	Cale	tac: What do you think of it?
2014-02-28 06:00:13	tac	I haven't read very much either, but I've skimmed through.
2014-02-28 06:00:23	tac	I think I got stuck, though, because it was back when I was trying to be too formalist
2014-02-28 06:00:31	Cale	I'm interested in hearing how more computer-sciency people cope with it
2014-02-28 06:00:45	tac	(There's a reason I slap imprimable's hand for thinking about category-as-foundations-for-math... I did the same thing, and it was more of a hinderance than anything else)

2014-02-28 06:02:47	Cale	It's definitely aging :)
2014-02-28 06:03:01	Cale	but it also looks like it covers good stuff
2014-02-28 06:03:37	tomprince	imprimable: It is much easier to answer a question like "I was reading such-and-such and had some difficulty understanding 'blah', where can I learn more." than "I want to read such-and-such, what do I need to know first." (At least any more than the introduction to such-and-such already has a section that says "here's the things we assume you know"
2014-02-28 06:04:15	Cale	imprimable: But yeah, maybe try to read the HoTT book directly, and then see where you get stuck
2014-02-28 06:04:51	imprimable	well the point is
2014-02-28 06:04:55	imprimable	maybe i'm too lazy

2014-02-28 06:06:06	tac	Working makes it really hard.
2014-02-28 06:06:13	tomprince	ystael: I liked JP May's book. Hatcher is not bad, but considered by some people to be not rigourous enough (i.e. it glosses over too many things).
2014-02-28 06:06:14	imprimable	(ye i just "understood" yoneda lemma)
2014-02-28 06:06:44	tac	tomprince: Hatcher also refuses to give straightforward definitions for things
2014-02-28 06:06:55	Cale	I don't like Hatcher's book because I think it does a lot of things in homotopy theory the wrong way which makes life harder than it should be.
2014-02-28 06:07:04	tac	Cale: examples?
2014-02-28 06:07:35	Cale	It does the Seifert-van Kampen theorem directly for groups and pointed spaces without mentioning groupoids, and without saying what a pushout is.
2014-02-28 06:07:46	Cale	(or mentioning pushouts iirc)
2014-02-28 06:07:48	tac	ah yeah
2014-02-28 06:07:54	tac	I could definitely see that
2014-02-28 06:08:33	tac	some books have a strange adversion to picking out a good level of generality
2014-02-28 06:08:47	tac	aversion?
2014-02-28 06:08:50	tac	yes, that word
2014-02-28 06:09:57	Cale	If you do it for the fundamental groupoid for multiple specified basepoints first, then the proof makes more sense, and the definition of the amalgamated free product of groups makes more sense when you get to collapsing things down to a single basepoint

2014-02-28 06:10:42	Cale	also, the theorem ends up being more general and usable
2014-02-28 06:10:59	Cale	for example, you can use it to compute the fundamental group of the circle in the end
2014-02-28 06:11:05	tac	hm
2014-02-28 06:11:06	Cale	which you can't do with the version in Hatcher
2014-02-28 06:11:18	tac	I got May's book, and I took a crack at it, but didn't get very far
2014-02-28 06:12:18	tac	but I almost got through Van Kampen with it
2014-02-28 06:12:29	Cale	(you need the intersection to be path-connected, which means that you can't decompose the circle into two overlapping intervals)
2014-02-28 06:12:47	Cale	(but you don't have that restriction when you do it via groupoids)
2014-02-28 06:13:24	tac	ahh
2014-02-28 06:14:46	imprimable	Cale: what do you think is the best book for homotopy, brown or the second you gave ?
2014-02-28 06:15:43	tac	imprimable: May is incredibly difficult
2014-02-28 06:15:53	tac	Brown is easier than Hatcher, too, IMO
2014-02-28 06:16:02	tac	(Hatcher relies on you knowing some basic algebra, what a free group is, etc)
2014-02-28 06:16:03	imprimable	ok
2014-02-28 06:16:22	tac	The first half of Brown is a review of classical point-set topology
2014-02-28 06:16:40	tac	So, it defines topology itself, talks about open and closed sets, continuous maps
2014-02-28 06:16:46	imprimable	yes i know that already
2014-02-28 06:16:53	tac	oh yeah?

2014-02-28 06:17:17	tac	oh, well, yeah
2014-02-28 06:17:25	tac	I'd go with Brown probably

2014-02-28 06:17:34	tac	although hatcher is free online

2014-02-28 06:37:54	tac	yeah. Simplicial complexes are kind of ugly
2014-02-28 06:38:27	Cale	So in his version of homology, you get to decompose the torus into two triangles
2014-02-28 06:39:01	tac	Although I think it might still be useful to introduce them first, since they have the nice property that the faces are always distinct
2014-02-28 06:39:21	tac	Otherwise, a line segment might only have a single endpoint :)

2014-03-01 00:55:48	imprimable	can i interprete it like "the hom functor knows everything about any object" ?

2014-03-01 03:02:21	tomprince	imprimable: Well, so it means what it says, no more, no less. But I think it is a reasonable way to understand what it is about.

2014-03-01 03:04:46	tomprince	Most any translation of a formal statment into informal understanding is likely to loose some details, and not capture everything.
2014-03-01 03:09:49	imprimable	yes thats true but "informal understanding" it what allows you to understand
2014-03-01 03:09:50	imprimable	:>
2014-03-01 03:09:56	imprimable	to have an intuition of it
2014-03-01 03:16:03	Cale	imprimable: Here's an intuition about it: You can turn any category into a concrete category via the functor C -> Set which sends each object X in C to the union over T in Ob(C) of Hom(T,X), i.e. the set of all arrows T -> X for various T throughout the category
2014-03-01 03:16:37	Cale	and it sends each arrow f: X -> Y to the set function which sends a: T -> X to f . a : T -> Y
2014-03-01 03:16:49	imprimable	any SMALL category
2014-03-01 03:16:50	imprimable	right ?
2014-03-01 03:17:38	Cale	right
2014-03-01 03:17:38	imprimable	yes so in some sense
2014-03-01 03:17:44	imprimable	all the "point of views" on an object
2014-03-01 03:17:49	imprimable	are sufficient to characterize entirely the object
2014-03-01 03:17:57	Cale	All the arrows into an object
2014-03-01 03:18:00	imprimable	yes
2014-03-01 03:18:18	Cale	The Yoneda embedding refines this
2014-03-01 03:18:24	imprimable	so its like saying "the hom functor knows everything about the objects"
2014-03-01 03:18:35	imprimable	ie, you only needs the arrows
2014-03-01 03:18:55	imprimable	its really not trivial at all
2014-03-01 03:19:10	Cale	Instead of sending an object X to the *set* of arrows into X, it sends the object X to the *functor* which given an object T will give the set of arrows T -> X
2014-03-01 03:19:45	Cale	Well, the fact that the structure of a category is all in the arrows and composition shouldn't be surprising.
2014-03-01 03:19:47	imprimable	yes, and you have the isomorphism Hom(yC,F) =~ FC
2014-03-01 03:20:00	Cale	The objects are really only there to help you remember which arrows are composable
2014-03-01 03:20:12	Cale	You have the identity arrows to serve as the objects in any case
2014-03-01 03:20:16	imprimable	true
2014-03-01 03:20:29	imprimable	but it also means that knowing a category
2014-03-01 03:20:38	imprimable	i mean, knowing the arrows
2014-03-01 03:20:49	imprimable	you already know entirely in which category you're working
2014-03-01 03:21:00	imprimable	but yes ok
2014-03-01 03:21:01	imprimable	this way is obvious
2014-03-01 03:21:28	Cale	So, the Yoneda embedding is sort of a refinement of the crude way to turn a small category into a concrete one
2014-03-01 03:21:46	imprimable	yes, it does it is an embedding
2014-03-01 03:21:47	tac	The way I think of Yoneda is that it's a kind of completion of your category
2014-03-01 03:21:55	imprimable	completion ?
2014-03-01 03:22:05	tac	In the same sense as taking the algebraic closure of your field, or constructing the real numbers by taking the metric complation of the rationals
2014-03-01 03:22:06	Cale	Yeah, well, I think that's the right way to think of it as well
2014-03-01 03:22:20	Cale	(I've already mentioned this before)
2014-03-01 03:22:30	tac	You can take any category, no matter how shitty, and "complete" it by adding all possible limits
2014-03-01 03:22:32	imprimable	because Sets has all limit, colimit, and stuff ?
2014-03-01 03:22:36	tac	yeah
2014-03-01 03:22:38	imprimable	i see
2014-03-01 03:22:45	Cale	Or more importantly, Sets^(C^op) does
2014-03-01 03:22:50	imprimable	so what is the "legitime" category
2014-03-01 03:22:56	imprimable	C or its embedding ?
2014-03-01 03:22:56	tac	limits, colimits, etc. I'm not sure on what the completion gives you in total, but I know it's quite a bit
2014-03-01 03:23:03	tac	You get a complete and cocomplete category
2014-03-01 03:23:08	tac	and its cartesian closed
2014-03-01 03:23:10	tac	and a topos
2014-03-01 03:23:12	tac	at the least
2014-03-01 03:23:26	tac	The "completed" C... the thing you embed it into
2014-03-01 03:23:26	imprimable	does it mean that the category you started with was not a "good one" if it wasn't complete ,
2014-03-01 03:23:27	imprimable	?
2014-03-01 03:23:28	Cale	Sets^(C^op) is complete, cocomplete, has all exponentials, has a subobject classifier (which qualifies it as a topos), is locally Cartesian closed...
2014-03-01 03:23:51	tac	Usually completeness is a good thing to have
2014-03-01 03:24:00	Cale	So, it has all the fancy widgets you could ever possibly want. You can interpret Coq in it.
2014-03-01 03:24:06	tac	in the sense, you can always take limits of whatever diagram you want
2014-03-01 03:24:13	imprimable	question
2014-03-01 03:24:19	imprimable	is there an "inverse" of the embedding ?
2014-03-01 03:24:30	imprimable	that would send it to another category but a complete one ?
2014-03-01 03:24:31	Cale	Well, what does the Yoneda lemma say?
2014-03-01 03:24:54	imprimable	that it is an embedding, so it is fully faithfull and injective on objects
2014-03-01 03:25:22	imprimable	what i mean is : you embed your category in Sets, you complete it
2014-03-01 03:25:26	imprimable	then you do a kind of "inverse"
2014-03-01 03:25:27	Cale	Right, so that fully faithful bit is what serves as your "inverse"
2014-03-01 03:25:53	Cale	It says that if you can find an arrow yA -> yB, then it must have come from an arrow A -> B
2014-03-01 03:25:58	imprimable	yes
2014-03-01 03:26:11	imprimable	but i want to do it after having completed my category
2014-03-01 03:26:14	imprimable	for example
2014-03-01 03:26:17	Cale	So, it lets you extract information about your original category through looking at its image in this much nicer category
2014-03-01 03:26:20	imprimable	can my completed embeding be non small ?
2014-03-01 03:26:40	Cale	Sets^(C^op) won't be a small category
2014-03-01 03:26:51	imprimable	can my completed embeding be non locally small ?
2014-03-01 03:26:58	Cale	(Unless C is empty)
2014-03-01 03:27:35	Cale	C has to be locally small to begin with
2014-03-01 03:27:43	Cale	and then Sets^(C^op) will be too
2014-03-01 03:27:45	imprimable	yes, then you embed it, then you complete it
2014-03-01 03:27:50	imprimable	and then you look for an "inverse"
2014-03-01 03:28:01	Cale	What do you mean by inverse?
2014-03-01 03:28:08	imprimable	to come back to an "abstract" category
2014-03-01 03:28:11	Cale	huh?
2014-03-01 03:28:16	imprimable	to see if the yoneda embeding commutes with my completion
2014-03-01 03:28:32	Cale	The "completion" of C we're talking about here is the category Sets^(C^op)
2014-03-01 03:29:00	imprimable	yes so its like a subcategory of Sets
2014-03-01 03:29:03	imprimable	thx to yoneda lemma
2014-03-01 03:29:04	imprimable	right ?
2014-03-01 03:29:07	Cale	...no?
2014-03-01 03:29:09	imprimable	hm
2014-03-01 03:29:12	imprimable	then i didn't get it
2014-03-01 03:29:23	Cale	Sets^(C^op) is the category of functors C^op -> Sets
2014-03-01 03:29:54	imprimable	oh yes, yoneda lemma only tells you that the natural transformation of your cotnravatianr Hom functor to a functor F IS a set
2014-03-01 03:29:59	Cale	(and natural transformations between them)
2014-03-01 03:30:03	imprimable	it doesn't say anything for the rest
2014-03-01 03:30:03	imprimable	yes
2014-03-01 03:30:29	imprimable	ok i got it :>
2014-03-01 03:30:35	imprimable	but can i find a category C*
2014-03-01 03:30:57	imprimable	such that y(C*) is equivalent to C* ?
2014-03-01 03:31:14	imprimable	ok you gonna tell me, this is Sets^C^op
2014-03-01 03:31:20	imprimable	erm no
2014-03-01 03:31:24	imprimable	so i mean
2014-03-01 03:31:25	imprimable	can i find C*
2014-03-01 03:31:31	imprimable	such that yC* = Sets^C^op
2014-03-01 03:31:32	imprimable	:>
2014-03-01 03:31:48	imprimable	(or equivalent yes)
2014-03-01 03:33:35	Saizan_	the question is if you can find C
2014-03-01 03:34:01	imprimable	no, suppose i start with a non complete small category C
2014-03-01 03:34:09	imprimable	then i embed it into Sets^C^op that i complete and cocomplete
2014-03-01 03:34:18	imprimable	can i find C* such that yC* = Sets^C^op ?
2014-03-01 03:34:29	Saizan_	y doesn't act on categories
2014-03-01 03:34:39	imprimable	yes i know
2014-03-01 03:34:47	Saizan_	y is a functor C -> Sets^(C^op)
2014-03-01 03:34:52	imprimable	yes ok
2014-03-01 03:34:55	imprimable	let me reformulate
2014-03-01 03:35:35	imprimable	can i find C* such that C* and Sets^C^op are equivalent ?
2014-03-01 03:35:51	imprimable	(without, of course, taking C* = Sets^C^op)
2014-03-01 03:36:10	Saizan_	so you want a less concrete one?
2014-03-01 03:36:12	imprimable	yes
2014-03-01 03:36:15	imprimable	i want an abstract one
2014-03-01 03:37:15	Saizan_	don't know
2014-03-01 03:40:45	Saizan_	maybe you can do something synthetically
2014-03-01 03:41:05	Saizan_	where you add missing stuff as basically syntax, and quotient by the laws
2014-03-01 03:41:14	imprimable	oh yes
2014-03-01 03:41:15	imprimable	i see
2014-03-01 03:41:26	Saizan_	but i think that's not going to work as well wrt the constructions that C already has

2014-03-03 20:24:35	Saizan	the latter is a classic, but if you're not a working mathematician you might have problems with the examples
2014-03-03 20:26:18	TauNeutrino	Is this really aimed at "working mathematicians"??

2014-03-06 01:27:06	imprimable	hi
2014-03-06 01:27:24	imprimable	why is the category of elements of a functor P : small category C^op to Sets small ?
2014-03-06 01:30:26	tomprince	imprimable: You might find http://j2kun.svbtle.com/mathematicians-are-chronically-lost-and-confused interesting to read.
2014-03-06 01:30:32	imprimable	thx
2014-03-06 01:32:14	imprimable	ahah
2014-03-06 01:32:17	imprimable	chronically lost and confused
2014-03-06 01:33:19	imprimable	but this is about research
2014-03-06 01:33:29	imprimable	not about learning wht is already well understood and exposed
2014-03-06 01:33:33	imprimable	(i keep reading)
2014-03-06 01:39:04	imprimable	well tomprince, i would agree for the exercice part
2014-03-06 01:39:16	imprimable	but not for the important theorem/definiton/lemma part
2014-03-06 01:39:40	imprimable	that i feel, must be understood clearly without continuing the rest of the course
2014-03-06 01:40:17	imprimable	how can you have a big picture of the theory if you skipe some important definition/theorem ? (by skipping, i mean, you don't understnad them really)
2014-03-06 01:40:43	tomprince	How do you know if you "understand them really"?
2014-03-06 01:41:02	imprimable	hm, you can "feel" it ?
2014-03-06 01:41:10	imprimable	as if you were the first one to discover it ?
2014-03-06 01:41:20	imprimable	you're able to "guess" it ?
2014-03-06 01:42:35	imprimable	thats something i usually tell me when i do a math course/theory
2014-03-06 01:42:43	imprimable	"someone though about it a first time, if he could, i can"
2014-03-06 01:43:04	imprimable	of course, i'm cheating, i have the results in front of me, but still
2014-03-06 01:47:31	tomprince	Being able to come up with it is different from understanding it.
2014-03-06 01:47:54	imprimable	you think so ?
2014-03-06 01:48:03	imprimable	to me its quite related
2014-03-06 01:48:34	tomprince	It probably depends on the statement/definition in question.
2014-03-06 01:49:07	imprimable	i think, once you're "convinced" that the definition is teh "best" one for what it was introduced
2014-03-06 01:49:15	imprimable	or the statement becomes "obvious"
2014-03-06 01:49:19	imprimable	you can say you understand it
2014-03-06 01:49:37	imprimable	for example, yesterday i read the definition of a topos in awodey
2014-03-06 01:49:37	tomprince	But, for example, understanding pythoagoras's theorem doesn't need to involve how to prove it, and understanding how to prove it doesn't really give you any understanding on why it is a useful theorem.
2014-03-06 01:50:01	imprimable	hm i think
2014-03-06 01:50:07	imprimable	it depends what you mean by "prove"
2014-03-06 01:50:16	imprimable	if you use "proof" as something like, checking the consistncy of it
2014-03-06 01:50:20	imprimable	of course it doesnt mean you get it
2014-03-06 01:50:29	imprimable	a bot can do it
2014-03-06 01:51:08	imprimable	but, if you can understand why the hypothesis are what they are and not stronger or weaker
2014-03-06 01:51:11	imprimable	and come up with a proof
2014-03-06 01:51:19	imprimable	i guess you can claim you understand the theorem
2014-03-06 01:51:46	imprimable	and when you guess the theorem before you read it
2014-03-06 01:51:51	imprimable	i guess its a good proof that you got it :>

2014-03-06 02:20:01	tac	When people write f_* with f some morphism
2014-03-06 02:20:15	tac	That typically means the same thing as Hom(f, A) for a fixed object A, right?
2014-03-06 02:20:55	tomprince	I suspect at least some of the time you are fooling yourself, or at least don't have a complete understanding as is possible.
2014-03-06 02:21:26	tomprince	tac: Often, yes (modulo that I can never rememeber whether superscript or subscript is contravariant and which is covariant.
2014-03-06 02:21:47	tac	Yeah.
2014-03-06 02:21:57	tac	But the yoneda embedding takes f to Hom(-, f), not f_*
2014-03-06 02:22:04	tac	Was the actual question I wanted to ask.
2014-03-06 02:23:16	tomprince	Well, typicaly ambiguity means that f_* refers to both the fixed and unfixed versions.
2014-03-06 02:23:24	tac	Yeah, f^*(g) = g o f, f^*(g) = f o g, I think
2014-03-06 02:23:54	tomprince	I think one of those ^ shuold be _ there.
2014-03-06 02:24:24	tac	err, yeah. Above I wrote f_* = Hom(f, A), but it really should be f_* = Hom(A, f)
2014-03-06 02:24:56	tac	(This is worse than trying to remember how sine and cosine relate via the derivative in high school)
2014-03-06 02:25:42	tomprince	The way I always remember *that* is by thinking of the graphs at 0.
2014-03-06 02:27:14	tac	graphs at 0?
2014-03-06 02:27:30	tomprince	of sine and cosine.
2014-03-06 02:27:34	tac	ahh

2014-03-06 03:56:33	imprimable	think about the opposite functor
2014-03-06 03:56:35	imprimable	how is that mind blowing ?
2014-03-06 03:57:08	imprimable	that's what it means : you used the opposite functor somewhere
2014-03-06 03:58:56	imprimable	and for your question about notation
2014-03-06 03:59:08	imprimable	f_* is obviously "precomposition by f"
2014-03-06 03:59:17	imprimable	what is going "down" is like, its to the right of something
2014-03-06 03:59:26	imprimable	i think thats why peope chosed those notation
2014-03-06 04:00:08	imprimable	(because of the direction of reading, i suppose)
2014-03-06 04:00:13	imprimable	(if you go down, you're going to the right)
2014-03-06 04:05:15	tac	If I'm looking at the Yoneda embedding
2014-03-06 04:05:34	tac	I should be able to take any arrow Hom(-,f) and "extract" f from it, shouldn't I?
2014-03-06 04:06:04	tac	I guess that's exactly composition with id, isn't it
2014-03-06 04:06:23	imprimable	you know that it is unique because it is an embedding, but how to extract it
2014-03-06 04:06:25	imprimable	i have no idea
2014-03-06 04:07:19	tac	yeah, I think that's it.
2014-03-06 04:07:37	imprimable	if you draw your square with contravariant functor and covariant functor
2014-03-06 04:07:39	imprimable	it looks like it works yes
2014-03-06 04:07:40	tac	You take any arrow k : Hom(-, A) -> Hom(-, B)
2014-03-06 04:07:52	tac	and since k is a natural transformation, you look at k_A : Hom(A, A) -> Hom(A, B)
2014-03-06 04:07:57	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:07:58	tac	and you plug in the identity morphism at A
2014-03-06 04:07:59	imprimable	thats it
2014-03-06 04:08:09	imprimable	you draw the square with both contravariant and contravariant functor
2014-03-06 04:08:11	imprimable	it is natural
2014-03-06 04:08:12	imprimable	so it works
2014-03-06 04:08:27	imprimable	(covariant sorry)
2014-03-06 04:08:48	imprimable	(+ représentable)
2014-03-06 04:09:20	imprimable	maybe you can help me tac if you have some time
2014-03-06 04:09:51	imprimable	let P : C^op -> Sets a functor
2014-03-06 04:10:06	imprimable	where C is small
2014-03-06 04:10:29	imprimable	the category of elements of P is the category whose objects are the pairs (x,A) for A in C, and x in PA
2014-03-06 04:11:14	tac	so you basically collect all the elements in every set in the image of P
2014-03-06 04:11:23	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:11:28	imprimable	why is the object still small ?
2014-03-06 04:11:40	imprimable	i don't understand why it should be the case
2014-03-06 04:11:57	imprimable	the collection of objects is supposed to be still small
2014-03-06 04:12:00	tac	I think it would have to do with C being small
2014-03-06 04:12:08	tac	C is small, so the objects form a set
2014-03-06 04:12:20	tac	So the image under P would still be a set
2014-03-06 04:12:33	imprimable	and you take something that is lesser than a power set of this set
2014-03-06 04:12:34	imprimable	thats it ?
2014-03-06 04:13:01	imprimable	hm no
2014-03-06 04:13:07	tac	I'm not really so strong with set theory
2014-03-06 04:13:20	tac	And I think it's pedantic to make sharp distinctions between sets and classes
2014-03-06 04:13:28	imprimable	ah
2014-03-06 04:13:51	tac	but in this case, you basically have a set of sets, I think
2014-03-06 04:13:54	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:14:17	imprimable	but you then take something than is smaller than the set of all power sets of all eleents of your first set
2014-03-06 04:14:29	imprimable	so i guess this should proves that it is a set
2014-03-06 04:14:50	imprimable	is the arbitrary union of powerset a set ?
2014-03-06 04:14:51	imprimable	i don't even know
2014-03-06 04:15:32	tac	Isn't the union of P(S) just equal to S?
2014-03-06 04:15:52	imprimable	yes thats true
2014-03-06 04:16:05	tac	But here, you're not doing that
2014-03-06 04:16:07	imprimable	i didn't express myself well
2014-03-06 04:16:11	imprimable	its like a disjoint union
2014-03-06 04:16:13	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:16:38	imprimable	you have somehing that is clearly contained inside the disjoint union of all power sets of your sets
2014-03-06 04:17:06	imprimable	so if it is true that the disjoint union of arbitrary set if a set
2014-03-06 04:17:08	imprimable	i guess it works
2014-03-06 04:17:11	-->	Eduard_Munteanu (~EduardMun@188.25.6.200) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-03-06 04:17:35	tac	Sounds reasonable
2014-03-06 04:17:45	imprimable	when it comes about "arbitrary"
2014-03-06 04:17:47	imprimable	i never have any idea
2014-03-06 04:17:47	imprimable	:<
2014-03-06 04:18:04	tac	arbitrary doesn't really mean anything at all
2014-03-06 04:18:23	tac	It just sits there to give you a heads-up that we aren't working with something more restricted (usually, finite or countable)
2014-03-06 04:18:25	imprimable	well, it might mean uncountable
2014-03-06 04:18:44	tac	but arbirary will also include the countable and finite cases
2014-03-06 04:18:49	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:18:54	imprimable	but i can't make sense of uncountable union anyway
2014-03-06 04:19:08	tac	It's the same as any other
2014-03-06 04:19:10	imprimable	i think its an axiom of ZF ?
2014-03-06 04:19:20	tac	I have no idea. ZF is overrated.
2014-03-06 04:19:25	imprimable	oh i would agree yes
2014-03-06 04:19:31	tac	Actually, there's a book I recently got called the Joy of Sets
2014-03-06 04:19:33	imprimable	(thats why i want CT for foundations, but you told me hott is better :>)
2014-03-06 04:19:40	tac	That does a pretty good job motivating ZF set theory.
2014-03-06 04:19:48	tac	That might be a good place to look if you're curious
2014-03-06 04:20:15	imprimable	i think my reasonning works
2014-03-06 04:20:22	imprimable	an arbitrary union is just na union of pairs
2014-03-06 04:20:24	imprimable	pairs are set
2014-03-06 04:20:30	imprimable	so its ok
2014-03-06 04:20:49	imprimable	so once you land in Sets, you can't go outside of it i suppose
2014-03-06 04:20:57	tac	Also, I just stumbled upon the definition of "Universal Element" on wikipedia
2014-03-06 04:21:07	imprimable	(in the sense, any category constructed with Sets is small or locally small)
2014-03-06 04:21:23	tac	The union of an uncountable set is really not different from that of the union of a countable set
2014-03-06 04:21:42	tac	With the big exception that you can't prove by standard induction that any given element lives in that set
2014-03-06 04:21:45	imprimable	well for ZF yes
2014-03-06 04:21:51	imprimable	philosophically speaking
2014-03-06 04:21:52	imprimable	i dunno
2014-03-06 04:21:53	imprimable	:<<
2014-03-06 04:22:04	tac	countable and uncountable are really only different when you plan to count things, strangely enough.
2014-03-06 04:22:25	imprimable	you know, its like thykonov theorem in topology
2014-03-06 04:22:39	imprimable	i'm more troubled by the uncountable product
2014-03-06 04:22:41	imprimable	rather than it is compact
2014-03-06 04:22:58	tac	Philosophically speaking, countable and uncountable are a matter of how strong your ambient logic is (by the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, I believe)
2014-03-06 04:23:13	imprimable	what is this theorem ?
2014-03-06 04:23:48	tac	I don't know the exact statement, but from what I understand, it says that in a logical system with countable axioms, there exists a countable model.
2014-03-06 04:24:01	imprimable	what is the definition of model ?
2014-03-06 04:24:09	tac	So even though ZF says there are uncountable sets, there are models of ZF that have only countably many sets.
2014-03-06 04:24:27	tac	A model is a concrete "implementation" of a theory
2014-03-06 04:24:38	imprimable	how can it be true
2014-03-06 04:24:40	imprimable	in ZF
2014-03-06 04:24:43	imprimable	you have an infinite set
2014-03-06 04:24:46	imprimable	and the powerset axioma
2014-03-06 04:24:50	imprimable	so by cantor theorem
2014-03-06 04:24:51	tac	So, to be more concrete, you have "the theory of groups" which is just the group axioms
2014-03-06 04:24:53	imprimable	you have uncountability
2014-03-06 04:25:09	tac	Each group (the integers, the reals, the symmetric groups of order n) is then a model of the theory of groups
2014-03-06 04:25:26	imprimable	yes i see but not every group is "equivalent"
2014-03-06 04:25:29	tac	The idea behind the paradox is that you have two notions of countability
2014-03-06 04:25:42	tac	Countable in ZF and countable in the ambient logic.
2014-03-06 04:25:49	imprimable	ah
2014-03-06 04:26:08	imprimable	ZF contains by essence an uncountable set
2014-03-06 04:26:10	imprimable	just take P(N)
2014-03-06 04:26:11	imprimable	its over
2014-03-06 04:26:15	tac	ZF says there are uncountable things... but because you're looking at a model of the thing (and not the thing itself), what ZF claims has no "bite" to it.
2014-03-06 04:26:43	imprimable	ok so you can land on a "realization" of ZF that is really "weak"
2014-03-06 04:26:46	-->	yogurt_truck (~yogurt_tr@190.191.241.164) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-03-06 04:26:54	imprimable	and can't see or construct the uncountable sets
2014-03-06 04:27:10	tac	Well what does it mean for a set to be uncountable to begin with?
2014-03-06 04:27:23	tac	There's no injection into the naturals or something like that?
2014-03-06 04:27:25	imprimable	that there is no injection from it to N ?
2014-03-06 04:27:26	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:27:45	tac	Well, what if that injection can't be defined without some axiom?
2014-03-06 04:27:59	tac	Maybe it relies on the axiom of choice or something, but in regular ZF, you don't have that.
2014-03-06 04:28:05	imprimable	hm
2014-03-06 04:28:10	imprimable	then there's no such injection yes
2014-03-06 04:28:31	tac	(I don't actually know the subject all that well, so my examples might not be totally good, but that should convey the flavor of what's going on)
2014-03-06 04:28:50	imprimable	i personnally have many problems with uncountability treated with "elements" anyway
2014-03-06 04:29:02	imprimable	and CT can treat them in an algebraic way without referring to any elements
2014-03-06 04:29:07	imprimable	to me this is really satisfying
2014-03-06 04:29:11	tac	The way I see it, uncountability says more about the logic you're working in than the collection itself.
2014-03-06 04:29:17	tac	Logic is just weird like that
2014-03-06 04:29:24	tac	and CT doesn't really help in any fundamental way
2014-03-06 04:29:24	imprimable	then let's switch logic ?
2014-03-06 04:29:25	imprimable	:>
2014-03-06 04:29:44	tac	In fact, it's that weird behavior that lets us do some cool things with it.
2014-03-06 04:30:05	imprimable	well, because the axioma are really really strong
2014-03-06 04:30:05	tac	For example, in type theory, you can prove that every element of the naturals is either 0 or S(n) for some natural n, right?
2014-03-06 04:30:21	tac	(I say type theory, but this works with peano arithmetic, even)
2014-03-06 04:30:21	imprimable	i don't know anything in type theory
2014-03-06 04:30:31	tac	well, take my word for it then :)
2014-03-06 04:30:38	tac	In type theory, you can prove that statement
2014-03-06 04:30:39	imprimable	no its an axioma in peano arithmetic
2014-03-06 04:30:46	tac	_but_
2014-03-06 04:30:54	tac	In programming languages, even ones based on type theory (or something similar)
2014-03-06 04:31:00	tac	You can have non-0, non-successor elements
2014-03-06 04:31:06	imprimable	like
2014-03-06 04:31:08	imprimable	"hyper natural" ?
2014-03-06 04:31:09	imprimable	ahah
2014-03-06 04:31:13	tac	In Haskell, for instance, you have _|_
2014-03-06 04:31:23	tac	> 1 + fix id
2014-03-06 04:31:27	lambdabot	 mueval-core: Time limit exceeded
2014-03-06 04:31:33	tac	@type fix id :: Int
2014-03-06 04:31:34	lambdabot	Int
2014-03-06 04:31:39	imprimable	how do you know they exist tac
2014-03-06 04:31:41	imprimable	if you can't contruct them
2014-03-06 04:31:43	tac	See? fix id is an integer
2014-03-06 04:32:04	tac	but it's not 0. It's not successor (and it's not a negative number, either, but Haskell doesn't have built-in naturals, sadly)
2014-03-06 04:32:20	imprimable	how do you know they exist
2014-03-06 04:32:24	imprimable	if you can't construct them
2014-03-06 04:32:34	tac	I just did construct it
2014-03-06 04:32:38	tac	It type checks
2014-03-06 04:32:42	tac	that means I proved it exists
2014-03-06 04:32:45	tac	(in a sense)
2014-03-06 04:32:58	imprimable	its weird because to me
2014-03-06 04:33:02	tac	In Haskell, :: means \in
2014-03-06 04:33:08	tac	so fix id :: Int
2014-03-06 04:33:10	imprimable	what defines the structure of the integers is actually the successor property
2014-03-06 04:33:13	tac	means fix id is an element of Int
2014-03-06 04:33:30	imprimable	so you're telling me, the integers are "more" than just the ZF integer in haskell
2014-03-06 04:33:39	tac	yes
2014-03-06 04:33:48	imprimable	this doesn't fit with the idea i have of what an integer is
2014-03-06 04:33:49	tac	although some models of ZF might also have "nonstandard" integers, too
2014-03-06 04:34:06	tac	The thing is is that in Haskell, the integers are more than just 0, 1, 2, -1, -2, ....
2014-03-06 04:34:11	tac	There are undefined elements (like fix id)
2014-03-06 04:34:20	tac	and also partially defined elements (like 1 + fix id)
2014-03-06 04:34:24	tac	But, even so
2014-03-06 04:34:27	imprimable	well i would say that its a problem of your axioma behind that don't "code" well what are the integers
2014-03-06 04:34:27	imprimable	:>
2014-03-06 04:34:28	tac	They obey all the same algebraic laws
2014-03-06 04:34:51	imprimable	the idea of an integer is precisely that it is the "successor" of another one (but 0)
2014-03-06 04:34:54	tac	(where "algebraic law" is a weasle word that I'm not going to define)
2014-03-06 04:35:01	tac	or here
2014-03-06 04:35:04	tac	I have something that's cool
2014-03-06 04:35:17	tac	http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/sdg-pizza-seminar.pdf
2014-03-06 04:35:33	tac	^ check that paper out. It explains how to do calculus with infinitesimals in a topos
2014-03-06 04:35:37	imprimable	k
2014-03-06 04:36:03	tac	That paper relies on a trick: if you don't have the law of excluded middle, you can't prove infinitesimals don't exist.
2014-03-06 04:36:42	tac	You can't ever actually produce an infinitesimal directly, but because they _might_ exist, your logic gets all sorts of nice properties
2014-03-06 04:37:02	imprimable	but in intuitionistic logic, what you can't construct "doesn't exist"
2014-03-06 04:37:03	tac	namely, every function is smooth, and every set is a manifold
2014-03-06 04:37:04	imprimable	right ?
2014-03-06 04:37:11	tac	not necessarily
2014-03-06 04:37:22	tac	intuitionistic logic stays agnostic
2014-03-06 04:37:24	imprimable	so at least, you can't have acecss to them
2014-03-06 04:37:25	imprimable	yes
2014-03-06 04:37:27	imprimable	you can't conclude
2014-03-06 04:37:42	tac	That stuff mgiht exist. It might not. And we take advantage of that ambiguity to get some cool results.
2014-03-06 04:37:55	imprimable	well, under the hypothesis that they do exist
2014-03-06 04:38:04	imprimable	what if, if you add the axioma of their existence, you find some inconsistency ?
2014-03-06 04:38:14	tac	We end up unable to prove a lot of useful classical stuff, but that makes our logic more flexible
2014-03-06 04:38:30	tac	that's what model-building is for
2014-03-06 04:38:41	tac	Shulman mentions that near the end of the paper, briefly
2014-03-06 04:38:46	imprimable	ok
2014-03-06 04:38:57	imprimable	i would as an axiom
2014-03-06 04:39:01	tac	Generally, you take the logic and reduce it to set theory (namely, the "sheaf models" of the theory)
2014-03-06 04:39:01	imprimable	"what can't be constructed doesn't exist"
2014-03-06 04:39:02	imprimable	:>
2014-03-06 04:39:19	tac	That will run into trouble, though
2014-03-06 04:39:24	imprimable	ahah why
2014-03-06 04:39:27	tac	Because it's not obvious what can and cannot be constructed
2014-03-06 04:39:37	imprimable	its not for you, but for the theory it is right ?
2014-03-06 04:39:44	imprimable	the theory "knows" what is provable or not
2014-03-06 04:39:52	tac	You give the theory too much credit
2014-03-06 04:40:06	tac	That's like the naive assumption that someone knows themself better than anyone else
2014-03-06 04:40:22	tac	You have no idea how complicated your body is. You know only a small bit of it.
2014-03-06 04:40:30	tac	Theories are the same way
2014-03-06 04:40:38	imprimable	well, i guess i'm too platonistic
2014-03-06 04:40:54	tac	yes :P
2014-03-06 04:41:00	imprimable	so if you believe that, what about dynamical truth logic ?
2014-03-06 04:41:02	imprimable	like linear logic
2014-03-06 04:41:13	imprimable	so the theory IS the guy who is doing proof insid
2014-03-06 04:41:13	tac	I never looked into it
2014-03-06 04:41:15	imprimable	(its truth value at least)
2014-03-06 04:41:32	tac	I enjoy logic, but if you start pushing it, you end up chasing your own tail.
2014-03-06 04:41:45	imprimable	oh i think linear logic is really deep for the littel i understand
2014-03-06 04:41:56	imprimable	the linear implication contains some kind of "conservation law" inside it
2014-03-06 04:42:13	imprimable	like, the information is conserved for real
2014-03-06 04:42:26	tac	yeah
2014-03-06 04:42:27	tac	That's neat
2014-03-06 04:42:28	imprimable	in classical logic, because A => B <=> non A or B
2014-03-06 04:42:31	imprimable	this is really false
2014-03-06 04:42:37	imprimable	you have 0 conservation of information
2014-03-06 04:42:45	imprimable	in intuitionistic logic i guess you have "some kind" of it
2014-03-06 04:42:51	imprimable	but in linear logic its here from teh beginning

2014-03-09 23:41:04	imprimable	does it makes sense to speak about the category of a Hilbert space ?
2014-03-09 23:41:51	imprimable	such that the objects are the points of the hilbert space and the arrows ... i don't know
2014-03-09 23:41:58	imprimable	i want arrows between objects
2014-03-09 23:42:17	imprimable	i guess there is not a unique way to d so
2014-03-09 23:46:27	mr-	imprimable: you could have paths between your points as arrows..
2014-03-09 23:47:20	imprimable	yes i was thinking about that
2014-03-09 23:47:43	imprimable	but i want to code the arrow in another category
2014-03-09 23:48:10	imprimable	such that i have an embedding of the other category into such category
2014-03-09 23:48:29	imprimable	oh i guess its easy actually
2014-03-09 23:48:36	imprimable	ok sorry
2014-03-09 23:48:41	imprimable	pathes as arrows is good
2014-03-09 23:48:42	imprimable	:>
2014-03-09 23:49:22	mr-	If you want that to be a honest category, you will have to identify some paths
2014-03-09 23:49:50	imprimable	what if i only take the "rays" in the hilbert space ?
2014-03-09 23:49:51	mr-	maybe
2014-03-09 23:49:56	imprimable	would that be enough ?
2014-03-09 23:50:00	imprimable	i have an identity path
2014-03-09 23:50:14	imprimable	it is associative
2014-03-09 23:50:28	mr-	what's the identity ray? The whole space?
2014-03-09 23:50:53	imprimable	no, the orbite under the action of U(1) on a vector
2014-03-09 23:51:07	imprimable	wait
2014-03-09 23:51:09	imprimable	let me think
2014-03-09 23:51:21	imprimable	yes i think it works
2014-03-09 23:51:58	imprimable	or it might be simpler to take objects as orbits
2014-03-09 23:52:36	imprimable	and a path between those orbits would be ...
2014-03-09 23:52:49	imprimable	one representant in the quotient space
2014-03-09 23:52:51	imprimable	i think it works
2014-03-09 23:53:00	imprimable	associativity is good
2014-03-09 23:53:09	imprimable	and your unit is unique

2014-03-11 00:58:49	imprimable	why is an adjunction defined with Hom sets
2014-03-11 00:59:04	-->	whaletechno (~whaletech@unaffiliated/whaletechno) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-03-11 00:59:11	imprimable	this definition only works for locally small categories, so why is it defined this way
2014-03-11 00:59:37	imprimable	knowing a left adjoint needs not to be defined with hom set
2014-03-11 00:59:38	tac	Don't get hung up on largeness or smallness of categories. It's really immaterial for practical purposes.
2014-03-11 00:59:52	tac	Also, virtually every category you'll need is at least locally small.
2014-03-11 01:00:16	tac	The homset definition is important because it's the one "everyone uses"
2014-03-11 01:00:34	imprimable	but its not the most general one
2014-03-11 01:00:52	tac	So?
2014-03-11 01:01:12	imprimable	well, i find it "stupid" to define such an important concept not for every category
2014-03-11 01:01:12	tac	If you ignore size issues, the Homset definition always works
2014-03-11 01:01:16	imprimable	sure
2014-03-11 01:01:25	imprimable	but category theory can be done "outside" set theory
2014-03-11 01:01:37	imprimable	so why not just doing it as if set theory didn't exist ?
2014-03-11 01:01:43	tac	You just work with a Hom functor that takes your arrows to classes or some tiered class thing of whatever foundations you pretend to be using.
2014-03-11 01:01:53	imprimable	ok i see
2014-03-11 01:02:04	tac	Category theory was not invented to replace set theory
2014-03-11 01:02:28	tac	Absorb that, and everything else will be easier.
2014-03-11 01:02:30	imprimable	again, its not because it wasn't inventd for that, that its not better foundation (even though i know HoTT is better from what everyone told me here)
2014-03-11 01:02:41	imprimable	well i dislike set theory
2014-03-11 01:02:45	imprimable	so if i can do without it, i'm happy
2014-03-11 01:02:45	imprimable	:>
2014-03-11 01:02:59	tac	Like it or not, sets are conceptually a useful tool
2014-03-11 01:03:14	tac	And in particular, homsets are an important way of looking at categories
2014-03-11 01:03:16	imprimable	to do "real maths" yes
2014-03-11 01:03:26	imprimable	but foundational issues are important to me
2014-03-11 01:04:22	tac	If you want to pretend you're working inside some fixed topos, avoiding set theory all together, then you will never need an adjunction
2014-03-11 01:04:36	tac	Because everything you are doing, by definition, is "inside" the topos
2014-03-11 01:04:40	imprimable	because you will never go outside a topos ?
2014-03-11 01:04:45	tac	Right
2014-03-11 01:04:51	imprimable	what if you want to compare different theories
2014-03-11 01:04:52	tac	But, you can define internal categories in that topos
2014-03-11 01:04:53	imprimable	then, different topos
2014-03-11 01:05:11	imprimable	a functor is like an "operation"
2014-03-11 01:05:19	imprimable	so it is legit to look at functors between topos
2014-03-11 01:05:22	tac	no
2014-03-11 01:05:39	tac	If you want to work within a topos, you don't ever care about functors between that topos and any other topos
2014-03-11 01:05:47	imprimable	why won't you ?
2014-03-11 01:05:47	tac	If you're working inside of one, you don't care about other toposes at all.
2014-03-11 01:06:51	tac	Just like when you're working in ZFC, you don't really care about NBG set theory
2014-03-11 01:07:00	imprimable	oh well, you should
2014-03-11 01:07:03	imprimable	maybe there are things to say
2014-03-11 01:07:08	imprimable	about the "transition map" between theories
2014-03-11 01:07:19	imprimable	and if CT can allow you to make sense of that
2014-03-11 01:07:22	imprimable	this is really good
2014-03-11 01:07:25	tac	no it's not
2014-03-11 01:07:30	tac	It's nonsense.
2014-03-11 01:07:40	tac	Like, are we working under the assumption of LEM or not?
2014-03-11 01:07:54	imprimable	surely you need an ambient logic somewhere
2014-03-11 01:08:01	imprimable	that is the same for everyone
2014-03-11 01:08:01	tac	yes
2014-03-11 01:08:14	tac	and you are confusing ambient logic with what you're actually studying
2014-03-11 01:08:16	imprimable	so you're looking at different theories unde n ambient logic
2014-03-11 01:08:34	imprimable	why not, after all ? it is some kind of "internalization"
2014-03-11 01:12:41	<--	Isonax (~Isonax@unaffiliated/isonax) has left ##categorytheory ("Leaving")
2014-03-11 01:13:36	tomprince	A lot of the time, when something has multiple equivalent defintiions, people don't often worry about which one is the "actual" definition, since it doesn't matter.
2014-03-11 01:13:59	imprimable	but tehy are not equivalent here
2014-03-11 01:14:29	tomprince	As you point out, when trying to generalize things, it often turns out that different definitions have different natural generalizations, and people often use whichever makes the most sense in the particular context they are in.
2014-03-11 01:14:47	tomprince	But, for the original definition, one version isn't more real than any other.
2014-03-11 01:19:26	imprimable	i had a question by the way
2014-03-11 01:19:38	imprimable	is it possible to have a theory of dimension inside "some kind" of category ?
2014-03-11 01:26:17	tomprince	What do you mean bt "dimension"?
2014-03-11 01:26:34	imprimable	like in vector space for example
2014-03-11 01:28:18	Cale	There are probably a few things you could do to try to define something analogous to dimension
2014-03-11 01:29:13	Cale	Vector spaces (at least under the axiom of choice) have the nice property that they all decompose as products of copies of the underlying field.
2014-03-11 01:29:54	Cale	and the number of factors there is the dimension of the space of course
2014-03-11 01:30:35	Cale	In other contexts, not all the objects are freely generated like that.

2014-03-11 04:37:18	imprimable	does it mean that the structure on arrows in the same, but not on objects ?
2014-03-11 04:37:28	imprimable	and a natural isomorphism means that the structuer is both the same on arrows and objects ?
2014-03-11 04:37:42	tac	I'm not sure that makes a lot of sense
2014-03-11 04:37:53	tac	The arrows and objects don't have any structure
2014-03-11 04:38:12	imprimable	ok so lets say
2014-03-11 04:38:15	imprimable	the diagrams
2014-03-11 04:38:35	imprimable	i can "see" what it means to be a naturl transformation if i draw it, like, you have a cylinder between the two diagram
2014-03-11 04:38:40	imprimable	and it commutes
2014-03-11 04:38:52	imprimable	so in some sense, it means that the structure if the same "on arrows" right ?
2014-03-11 04:39:07	imprimable	is sorry
2014-03-11 04:41:15	tac	The cylinder is the correct picture to think about
2014-03-11 04:41:57	tac	If the functors are diagrams, the natural transformations are ways to map diagrams into other diagrams, roughly speaking
2014-03-11 04:42:16	imprimable	yes
2014-03-11 04:42:25	imprimable	and a diagram doesn't care about the nature of the objects
2014-03-11 04:42:35	imprimable	so its like you have the same structure "on arrows"
2014-03-11 04:43:10	imprimable	so the question is : what would it be to have the same structure on object, but not on arrows ?
2014-03-11 04:58:48	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: it's more like the person who "draws" the index category of a diagram doesn't care about its objects
2014-03-11 04:59:30	imprimable	yes but a natural transformation doesn't care about the objets right ?
2014-03-11 04:59:41	imprimable	(only when it is an ismorphism it does)
2014-03-11 05:01:08	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: I'm not sure that's true... what do you mean?
2014-03-11 05:01:20	Eduard_Munteanu	Are you talking about parametricity?

2014-03-11 05:02:24	imprimable	when the natural transformation is not a natural isomorphism
2014-03-11 05:02:38	imprimable	its not clear to me how "rigit" such struture is

2014-03-11 05:03:35	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: might be easier to think about functors, rather than diagrams, at the moment
2014-03-11 05:04:39	imprimable	ok so maybe it will be clearer if i say : what it means for two category C and D to have a natural transformation 1_C -> UF, where F : C->D, and U: D->C
2014-03-11 05:05:04	imprimable	clearly the "image" of FB is a subcategry of C

2014-03-11 05:12:34	imprimable	you obviously don't want to have a natural isomorphism
2014-03-11 05:12:41	imprimable	but how "strong" is the requirement to have such naturality ?
2014-03-11 05:12:42	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: not nearly as strong... look at the naturality square: eta_X o f = UF(f) o eta_Y
2014-03-11 05:13:15	Eduard_Munteanu	It lets you go one way or the other without changing the result but it's clearly not an isomorphism of any sort.
2014-03-11 05:13:31	imprimable	yes, but its quite easy to find a natural transformation then
2014-03-11 05:13:50	imprimable	if you think in Sets for example

2014-03-11 05:14:26	imprimable	sure, its a weakening of a natural isomorphism
2014-03-11 05:14:35	imprimable	and i understood that
2014-03-11 05:14:56	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: more generally adjunctions < equivalences < isomorphisms < equality to a very rough approximation
2014-03-11 05:15:11	imprimable	yes
2014-03-11 05:15:14	imprimable	thats how i understand it
2014-03-11 05:15:23	imprimable	adjunction as the "closest way of being an equivalence"
2014-03-11 05:16:41	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: the more important bit about adjunctions is the Hom(A, FB) ~ Hom(GA, B) bit
2014-03-11 05:16:56	imprimable	yes
2014-03-11 05:18:38	--	[mth]_away is now known as [mth]
2014-03-11 05:19:32	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: in that context, naturality is more of an alternative way to say the way you relate those functors is well-behaved
2014-03-11 05:20:33	imprimable	yes it allows you to "export" triangle
2014-03-11 05:21:05	Eduard_Munteanu	More of a minimal condition than something you might call strong, that is, not randomly associating stuff.
2014-03-11 05:21:11	imprimable	but still, i don't understand how "rigid" it is to have a natural transformation
2014-03-11 05:21:13	imprimable	yes
2014-03-11 05:21:16	imprimable	its not random thats it
2014-03-11 05:21:23	imprimable	you have "one big condition on associativity"
2014-03-11 05:21:23	imprimable	ok
2014-03-11 05:21:28	imprimable	looks legit to understnad it this way
2014-03-11 05:21:51	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: it's similar to asking how strong is "homo-" in group homomorphism
2014-03-11 05:21:58	imprimable	yes totally
2014-03-11 05:22:03	imprimable	"not a random map"
2014-03-11 05:22:04	imprimable	i got it
2014-03-11 05:22:04	imprimable	thx
2014-03-11 05:22:05	imprimable	:>
2014-03-11 05:22:15	imprimable	so you conserve "a bit" of the structure
2014-03-11 05:28:23	tomprince	imprimable: Well, if the target category has a terminal object, then there is a natural transformation from any functor to the contant functor on the terminal object. (and similiarly, a natural transofrmation from the constant functor on the initial object)
2014-03-11 05:28:44	tomprince	So, not necesarily rigid at all.
2014-03-11 05:28:51	imprimable	yes thats the example i though about too
2014-03-11 05:28:59	imprimable	thx
2014-03-11 05:29:20	imprimable	oh and question
2014-03-11 05:29:38	imprimable	can a functor be both a left adjoint and has a left adjoint ?
2014-03-11 05:30:04	tomprince	Yes a functor can be both left adjoint at right adjoint.
2014-03-11 05:30:28	imprimable	and i guess adjunction is an equivalence relation
2014-03-11 05:30:31	imprimable	so it is transitive
2014-03-11 05:30:34	imprimable	i should show that
2014-03-11 05:30:38	tomprince	No.
2014-03-11 05:30:40	imprimable	ah
2014-03-11 05:30:41	imprimable	it isn't ?
2014-03-11 05:31:12	Eduard_Munteanu	F -| G and G -| F isn't enough for an equivalence.
2014-03-11 05:31:22	imprimable	how comes, what would miss ?
2014-03-11 05:31:26	imprimable	ah
2014-03-11 05:31:29	imprimable	the naturality
2014-03-11 05:31:30	imprimable	ok
2014-03-11 05:31:50	tomprince	Consider forget: Top -> Set. That has natural left and right adjoints.
2014-03-11 05:32:03	tomprince	Given by the discrete and indiscrete topologies.
2014-03-11 05:32:14	imprimable	ok
2014-03-11 05:34:28	imprimable	maybe you guys can help me for a totally unrelated question ? :>
2014-03-11 05:34:49	Eduard_Munteanu	Only if naturally-related to category theory. :P
2014-03-11 05:34:57	imprimable	ahha it is "in some sense"
2014-03-11 05:35:04	imprimable	is a bounded countable lattice always complete ?
2014-03-11 05:35:13	imprimable	(see, it is in some sense :}})
2014-03-11 05:40:33	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: sounds right... if it's both bounded and countable all joins and meets are finite anyway
2014-03-11 05:40:45	Eduard_Munteanu	But I'm not very sure about this.
2014-03-11 05:40:55	imprimable	yes, i couldn't find a counter example, nor demonstrate it so
2014-03-11 05:41:03	imprimable	and nobody seems to know
2014-03-11 05:41:04	imprimable	:<
2014-03-11 05:43:26	Eduard_Munteanu	Er, I might be wrong.
2014-03-11 05:44:29	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: take a bounded interval of rationals... it's both countable and bounded but you have infinite subsets
2014-03-11 05:44:51	Eduard_Munteanu	So my argument is wrong, at least.
2014-03-11 05:45:23	imprimable	yes, but it is complete
2014-03-11 05:45:37	imprimable	and every example i could think about is complete
2014-03-11 05:45:48	imprimable	and even if you "try" to vizualize it on a Hasse diagram
2014-03-11 05:45:52	imprimable	it looks "obviously" true
2014-03-11 05:46:05	imprimable	(because of countability, one can try to induce it from finite hasse diagram)
2014-03-11 05:46:35	Eduard_Munteanu	imprimable: how about the (open) interval (0; 1) of rationals?
2014-03-11 05:46:50	imprimable	it is not bounded
2014-03-11 05:47:09	imprimable	as a lattice, it is not bounded
2014-03-11 05:47:12	imprimable	you don't have any top and bottom
2014-03-11 05:47:45	Eduard_Munteanu	Ah, right.

2014-03-12 00:57:43	imprimable	hi
2014-03-12 00:57:48	imprimable	i have a really dumb question
2014-03-12 00:58:04	imprimable	what does it mean for a functor to have an adjoint ?
2014-03-12 00:58:22	imprimable	i understand the definition, i understand that it is a "lose" sense of inverse
2014-03-12 00:58:34	imprimable	but i have no intuition at, given a functor F
2014-03-12 00:58:47	imprimable	how can i understand what would be the adjoint ?
2014-03-12 00:58:52	imprimable	without having to compute it explicitly
2014-03-12 01:09:09	<--	mjs2600 (~mjs2600`@192.58.147.218) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-03-12 01:10:46	Saizan	i think the Hom(F-,=) ~= Hom(-,G=) is the most illuminating definitions
2014-03-12 01:11:05	imprimable	yes i understand this one
2014-03-12 01:11:13	imprimable	so its a relation on arrows
2014-03-12 01:11:23	Saizan	it tells you how to scrutinize stuff in 'F' and how to build stuff in 'G'

2014-03-12 01:14:55	tomprince	The free/forgetful example is probably a useful guide to intuition.
2014-03-12 01:16:01	Cale	imprimable: btw, you missed this the other day, [0,1] /\ Q is bounded above and below, is countable, but there are sets of rationals which don't have a supremum in it, for example {x in [0,1] /\ Q : 2 x^2 < 1}
2014-03-12 01:16:34	Cale	imprimable: Basically, you can pick any irrational real and take the set of rationals less than that, and that won't have a supremum
2014-03-12 01:16:49	tomprince	Given that F is left adjoint to G, Constructing maps out of F x (the "free" thing on x) to y is the same is constructing maps x to G y (the "underlying" thing of "y")
2014-03-12 01:17:42	tomprince	"free" and "underlying" aren't really always appropriate, but the pair of ways about thinking of elements of Hom(Fx,y) and Hom(x,Gy) is still useful.

2014-03-12 01:23:23	engimo	free/forgetful is almost always the one you want to have in mind
2014-03-12 01:23:31	Cale	imprimable: It can be weird trying to answer these "but what is it *really*?" sorts of questions when it comes to abstractions, because the answer is almost always less general than the abstraction.
2014-03-12 01:24:02	Cale	There are lots of good ways to think about abstractions like this by analogy with the many examples.
2014-03-12 01:25:00	Cale	But at the end of the day, the definition is the definition :)
2014-03-12 01:25:28	Cale	Of course, you can also try to answer that question by going in the other direction, and looking for an even more abstract way to present the structure of adjunctions.
2014-03-12 01:25:50	Cale	and maybe that will somehow be simpler to think about than the original
2014-03-12 01:26:30	Cale	If you haven't seen the presentation of adjunctions and monads via string diagrams, I highly recommend checking out the Catsters videos about that
2014-03-12 01:27:04	Cale	(I'll dig them up)
2014-03-12 01:27:20	Cale	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USYRDDZ9yEc -- here they are
2014-03-12 01:34:08	imprimable	<Cale> imprimable: btw, you missed this the other day, [0,1] /\ Q is bounded above and below, is countable, but there are sets of rationals which don't have a supremum in it, for example {x in [0,1] /\ Q : 2 x^2 < 1}
2014-03-12 01:34:09	imprimable	<Cale> imprimable: Basically, you can pick any irrational real and take the set of rationals less than that, and that won't have a supremum
2014-03-12 01:34:09	imprimable	THX
2014-03-12 01:34:10	imprimable	:>
2014-03-12 01:35:14	imprimable	tomprince: yes ok, so you see F as teh "constructing functor" and G the forgetful one
2014-03-12 01:35:14	imprimable	i see
2014-03-12 01:36:10	imprimable	thx Cale, gonna check the presentation with string diagram
2014-03-12 01:36:11	tomprince	That is one way of thinking about it, but as Cale rightly points out, any intuitive way of looking at things is inherently inaccuate.
2014-03-12 01:37:43	imprimable	it might be inaccurate, but its a good "guide" for many things at least
2014-03-12 01:39:07	tomprince	Sure. As long as you remember that it isn't what it means, just a sometimes (often?) useful tool for helping think about it.
2014-03-12 01:39:22	Cale	Yeah, the only thing to worry about is that if you're stuck in thinking about some abstraction via a smaller class of examples, then that smaller class of examples might have some additional properties which the abstraction doesn't actually require.
2014-03-12 01:40:02	Cale	But for example, everyone reasons about metric spaces by drawing diagrams in 2D on the blackboard which look like blobs with circles in them
2014-03-12 01:40:25	imprimable	yes
2014-03-12 01:40:26	Cale	and as long as you can keep in mind what the rules really are, then those diagrams can be helpful :)
2014-03-12 01:40:48	Cale	(even though occasionally if you do anything too complicated, they can be misleading)

2014-03-12 05:22:02	nwf	 Can somebody explain to me why Joy of Cats considers it OK to define a representable functor as F : C -> Set such that F nat. iso. hom_C(A,-) (with A : Set) but other works declare that to be the definition only for covariant functors and give the nat. iso. to hom_C(-,A) version for contravariant functors? Is there some way of getting from the first to the second that I amn't seeing or is it just
2014-03-12 05:22:05	nwf	assumed that the readers of Joy of Cats are smart enough to dualize everything in their heads?

2014-03-12 20:38:44	imprimable	let F : C -> D, and G : C -> D two functors
2014-03-12 20:39:13	imprimable	is there some property if there exist a natural transformation from F -> G and from G -> F  ?
2014-03-12 20:42:35	imprimable	is there a property like : either F and G are naturally isomorph, either one of them is a constant functor or sth like that ?
2014-03-12 20:44:06	imprimable	because if eta : F -> G, eta' : G -> F
2014-03-12 20:44:10	imprimable	then eta°eta' : F -> F
2014-03-12 20:44:15	imprimable	and eta' ° eta : G -> G
2014-03-12 20:44:41	imprimable	(the opposite sorry)
2014-03-12 20:46:53	imprimable	mh, i guess this works if one add the condition of uniqueness
2014-03-12 20:47:51	imprimable	if there exist a unique natural transformation from F -> G, and a unique natural transformation from G -> F
2014-03-12 20:48:29	imprimable	eiher F and G are naturally isomorphic, either one of the functor is a constant functor that sends the category C on an object that is both initla and final
2014-03-12 20:48:32	imprimable	looks like it work

2014-03-14 21:49:07	mr-	what is NNO?
2014-03-14 21:49:14	imprimable	a natural number object
2014-03-14 21:49:26	imprimable	an initial element in the category of diagram of the form 1 -> N -> N
2014-03-14 21:49:38	imprimable	ie, you capture fully the recursive structure of the natural number
2014-03-14 21:49:46	imprimable	this definition is really beautiful
2014-03-14 21:50:59	mr-	Real numbers are ugly, so RNOs are bound to be ugly, too ;-P
2014-03-14 21:51:03	imprimable	ahah
2014-03-14 21:51:06	imprimable	i would agree
2014-03-14 21:51:19	imprimable	but if you can define what it means to be uncountable like R without any references to elements
2014-03-14 21:51:27	imprimable	i would "believe" in the existence of R
2014-03-14 21:51:27	imprimable	:>
2014-03-14 21:51:57	imprimable	set theory gives a bad characterization of what R is
2014-03-14 21:52:08	imprimable	it tells you that most elements of R can't even be defined/computable
2014-03-14 21:52:59	mr-	If you want something computable, maybe you want to look at HoTT?
2014-03-14 21:53:10	imprimable	yes, thats what everyone tells me ahah
2014-03-14 21:53:13	imprimable	i should
2014-03-14 21:53:47	mr-	There are two type-theoretic definitions of R in The Book..
2014-03-14 21:56:29	imprimable	i have so many things to look first
2014-03-14 21:56:39	imprimable	some type theory course from girard, some topos theory
2014-03-14 22:00:01	mr-	If the aim is HoTT, why do you care about Topos Theory?
2014-03-14 22:00:15	imprimable	because i want to understand what a lawvere theory is
2014-03-14 22:00:22	imprimable	(first)
2014-03-14 22:00:33	imprimable	and because topos theory might be a good framework to formulate physics
2014-03-14 22:00:40	imprimable	but maybe HoTT is even better
2014-03-14 22:01:53	mr-	I don't see that Topos Theory is needed to understand what a Lawvere Theory is

2014-03-14 22:02:47	imprimable	no, i'm coming from physics
2014-03-14 22:03:13	imprimable	and i would like to formulate everything from an algebraic point of view : ie, categorical
2014-03-14 22:03:22	imprimable	some people do that already : coecke and isham
2014-03-14 22:03:25	imprimable	but not in a way that satisfy me
2014-03-14 22:04:13	mr-	Yeah.. can't comment on that, except to mumble "John Baez"
2014-03-14 22:04:33	imprimable	well, i looked at some of his paper
2014-03-14 22:04:37	imprimable	he is not a good physicist
2014-03-14 22:04:39	imprimable	i mean
2014-03-14 22:04:47	imprimable	all he does is "trivial" physic stuff with categorical stuff
2014-03-14 22:04:59	imprimable	(doesn't mean he isn't a good mathematician)
2014-03-14 22:06:17	imprimable	is there some category whose internal logic is linear logic ?
2014-03-14 22:06:53	mr-	I don't know
2014-03-14 22:08:48	imprimable	(because non commutative linear logic might trivialize quantum mechanics)

2014-03-15 01:24:07	Cale	The descriptions of the reals in HoTT are similarly ugly. There's a presentation by Cauchy sequences which is especially well-suited to HoTT though, in that it uses higher-inductive paths to encode the equivalence relation on Cauchy sequences of rationals.
2014-03-15 01:25:51	Cale	Things are made somewhat messier in HoTT and the ncatlab article because they're trying to keep it constructive, which complicates the description a bit.
2014-03-15 01:28:04	imprimable	i see
2014-03-15 01:28:15	imprimable	so the algebraization of analysis is complicated
2014-03-15 01:29:07	-->	Guest97126 (~jao@26.136.14.37.dynamic.jazztel.es) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-03-15 01:31:22	Cale	Well, the reals themselves are not an obvious thing. They're an intuitive thing to define, but once you define them, even in classical mathematics where you have a uniqueness result (up to isomorphism of ordered fields), there are statements about the existence of particular real numbers which say deep things about the underlying set theory.
2014-03-15 01:32:19	Cale	I suppose it's to be expected, because classical real numbers can in some sense "contain an infinite amount of information".
2014-03-15 01:51:10	imprimable	is there a canonical way to define a field in CT ?
2014-03-15 01:51:19	imprimable	like, "this category is a field"
2014-03-15 01:51:39	imprimable	therefore you might have a category of "real"
2014-03-15 01:52:27	imprimable	well no
2014-03-15 01:52:34	imprimable	what you want is an internal caracterization so
2014-03-15 01:55:30	Cale	You could probably simplify that description of a real numbers object into one. Fields aren't as nice as rings, because the axiom for inverses requires that the number not be equal to 0 (or constructively, be apart from 0)
2014-03-15 01:56:14	imprimable	yes
2014-03-15 01:56:21	imprimable	and you can't say that easily with equation
2014-03-15 01:56:24	Cale	yeah
2014-03-15 01:56:27	imprimable	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/real+numbers+object
2014-03-15 01:56:30	imprimable	this definition is pure shit
2014-03-15 01:56:33	imprimable	it involves set
2014-03-15 01:56:52	imprimable	so its a failed internatilization of what R is
2014-03-15 01:57:32	imprimable	why are people claiming they do "internalization"
2014-03-15 01:57:34	imprimable	is tehy use sets ?
2014-03-15 01:57:36	imprimable	are they retarded ?
2014-03-15 01:57:41	imprimable	i saw baez do that too
2014-03-15 01:57:47	Cale	What are you talking about?
2014-03-15 01:57:51	imprimable	i'm sorry but, this is not what i would call a legit internalization in CT
2014-03-15 01:57:58	imprimable	people are defining structures with concepts of Sets
2014-03-15 01:58:00	imprimable	or with the Sets category
2014-03-15 01:58:13	imprimable	and then they claim it is a "categorification" of some set theoretic concepts
2014-03-15 01:58:25	Cale	There are ways in which sets interact with every (ordinary) category
2014-03-15 01:58:40	imprimable	yes, but a true "categorification" shouldn't involve any sets
2014-03-15 01:58:48	Cale	Because for instance, you have a *set* of arrows between any pair of objects.
2014-03-15 01:58:54	Cale	(if it's a small category)
2014-03-15 01:59:02	imprimable	well, the concept of small category relies on set theory
2014-03-15 01:59:11	imprimable	ie, on a way to construct your objects nd your arrows
2014-03-15 01:59:19	Cale	(and if it's large, well, you still have a set one universe up)
2014-03-15 01:59:22	imprimable	you don't need that to have some category theoretic concepts
2014-03-15 01:59:51	imprimable	you could imagine "theory imprimable" that is a theory to constructs the objects and arrows inside a CT
2014-03-15 01:59:54	imprimable	inside a category
2014-03-15 02:00:07	imprimable	and have some functor from any abstract category C to the category of "imprimable"
2014-03-15 02:00:09	imprimable	and so on
2014-03-15 02:00:17	Cale	With the real numbers, you're very likely to see definitions which somehow involve something which looks like sets in one way or another
2014-03-15 02:00:18	imprimable	a true categorification shouldn't edpend on your way of constructing your objects
2014-03-15 02:00:42	Cale	Because the completeness aspect of the real numbers is very much a second-order property only.
2014-03-15 02:01:02	imprimable	then maybe reals are a misconception of set theory
2014-03-15 02:02:06	tac	?
2014-03-15 02:02:24	Cale	The real numbers have been quite useful though :)
2014-03-15 02:02:26	imprimable	well, if you can't capture their structure without refering at any points to a set
2014-03-15 02:02:34	imprimable	it means that it is a misconception proper to set theory
2014-03-15 02:02:46	imprimable	i won't believe in their existence if one can't characterize their structure
2014-03-15 02:03:00	imprimable	sure Cale, but even in physics you don't need them to have the required symmetries of space time
2014-03-15 02:03:10	Cale	You're always making judgement calls about whether inanimate objects are good or bad. It's weird :)
2014-03-15 02:03:18	imprimable	ahah
2014-03-15 02:03:21	imprimable	i guess its my form of "platonism"
2014-03-15 02:03:22	imprimable	:<
2014-03-15 02:03:27	tac	imprimable: Saying things so inarticulately is likely to offend people :X
2014-03-15 02:03:41	tomprince	imprimable: You often seem to have very clear ideas of what *shouldn't* be done, but often no suggestions on how to replace them.
2014-03-15 02:03:43	tac	You can specify the reals just fine in category theory
2014-03-15 02:03:45	Cale	The real numbers might not be suitable for all purposes
2014-03-15 02:03:50	Cale	and they are indeed tricky to generalise
2014-03-15 02:03:59	imprimable	tomprince: giev me some time to do it ;>
2014-03-15 02:04:02	Cale	But they have definitely been a useful abstraction
2014-03-15 02:04:02	imprimable	(or try)
2014-03-15 02:04:06	tac	You just need to work in a setting where you hae the tools to do it.
2014-03-15 02:04:36	tac	have*
2014-03-15 02:04:48	imprimable	the point is
2014-03-15 02:04:56	imprimable	as far as i understand CT, it is a theory of structure
2014-03-15 02:05:09	imprimable	you don't need to specify any "sub theory" that tell you how to construct your objects and your arrows
2014-03-15 02:05:19	imprimable	to define concepts there, and define "structures" there
2014-03-15 02:05:26	imprimable	see for example the notion of natural number objects or product
2014-03-15 02:05:28	imprimable	or limite
2014-03-15 02:05:30	imprimable	or adjoint
2014-03-15 02:05:38	tac	Then why not just use functions to represent each real number?
2014-03-15 02:05:50	tac	In set theory, a real is just a function from {*} into R
2014-03-15 02:05:57	imprimable	because you cheat
2014-03-15 02:05:59	imprimable	you use {*}
2014-03-15 02:06:02	imprimable	and R
2014-03-15 02:06:03	Cale	By the way, what do you mean about this definition of RNO requiring sets?
2014-03-15 02:06:06	tomprince	imprimable: Sure, but until you do, consider the possibility that other people have tried, and what we have now is the best comproimise available.
2014-03-15 02:06:18	imprimable	tomprince: ahah true
2014-03-15 02:06:26	tac	imprimable: {*} is just the initial object. R can be constructed through natural numbers, products, quotients, and subsets.
2014-03-15 02:06:28	imprimable	Cale: look at the nlab page
2014-03-15 02:06:46	imprimable	(thn call it 0 tac ;>)
2014-03-15 02:06:49	Cale	imprimable: In the categories that they're working in, you can interpret most of set theoretical notation.
2014-03-15 02:06:56	imprimable	oh
2014-03-15 02:06:57	imprimable	ok
2014-03-15 02:06:58	tomprince	It can be somewhat grating to have somebody come along, who is just learning things, say "you are doing it wrong" but not have any suggestion on how to do it better.
2014-03-15 02:07:05	tac	imprimable: Huh? You would call it 1, not 0....
2014-03-15 02:07:08	imprimable	ahah i agree tomprince
2014-03-15 02:07:33	imprimable	you meant terminal then tac
2014-03-15 02:07:47	imprimable	and yes you're right it is a terminal object (of course)
2014-03-15 02:08:01	tac	yes
2014-03-15 02:08:02	tac	I do mean that
2014-03-15 02:08:19	imprimable	tomprince: but its my enthousiasm that makes me do such clam
2014-03-15 02:08:20	imprimable	its like
2014-03-15 02:08:32	imprimable	i feel CT is really a good framework to define all this stuff free from objects
2014-03-15 02:08:34	tac	still, you're ranting and raving about the philosophy of category theory instead of sitting down and learning about it :<
2014-03-15 02:08:51	imprimable	i'm learning it tac, but not at 15 pages per day yes :<
2014-03-15 02:08:56	imprimable	i'm at last chapter of awodey
2014-03-15 02:08:57	imprimable	on monads
2014-03-15 02:09:20	Cale	There's an extent to which I can agree that all presentations of the real numbers are somewhat inadequate and we could perhaps hope for better. But sitting around hoping for something better to come along won't get us anywhere. :)
2014-03-15 02:09:37	imprimable	ahah i agree
2014-03-15 02:09:45	imprimable	but thats why i asked if someone did better first Cale ,}
2014-03-15 02:14:50	Cale	The prettiest approach to introducing the real numbers I'm aware of is the classical axiomatic one taken for instance in the early chapters of Spivak, where you mostly ignore the construction in terms of sets, but you do need one axiom which talks about sets of reals.
2014-03-15 02:15:22	tac	Yes. I read the first few chapters of Spivak last week, and his introduction of the reals is very nice.

2014-03-15 02:17:30	imprimable	i'm going to check it
2014-03-15 02:17:31	imprimable	thx
2014-03-15 02:19:04	tac	Roughly, it's that R is a field. Every element is positive, negative, or 0. Positive numbers are closed under + and *. All values are finite, meaning for any positive r, you can find a number 1 + 1 + ... + 1 > r.
2014-03-15 02:19:18	tac	And given any set bounded from above, there is a least upper bound.
2014-03-15 02:19:37	tac	I think that should be it.
2014-03-15 02:19:42	Cale	I suppose that Spivak also uses a set of positive numbers. That's avoidable if you really want to avoid sets. (Exercise 1.8 has you show that an alternate axiomatisation is equivalent)
2014-03-15 02:20:27	tac	I think you should be able to avoid sets in the least-upper-bound property if you replace "set" with "sequence"
2014-03-15 02:20:35	Cale	But the least upper bound property really can't be expressed as a first order property involving the field operations and ordering.
2014-03-15 02:20:44	tac	right
2014-03-15 02:21:22	Cale	Yeah, you can replace sets with sequences, and that's kind of what's done in HoTT.
2014-03-15 02:21:37	Cale	(actually, in HoTT, they use functions from the positive rationals)

2014-03-17 03:28:00	Saizan	https://ihp2014.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/doku.php?id=workshop_2 <- what is a representable natural transformation?
2014-03-17 03:28:59	engimo	a natural transformation is a functor between functors
2014-03-17 03:29:22	engimo	a morphism, if you prefer -- such things can be representable
2014-03-17 03:33:57	Saizan	mh, i've usually seen representable associated with functors, i know a natural transformation is a morphism in a functor category, but for eta : F -> G to be a functor i'd have to think of F and G as categories
2014-03-17 03:34:20	Saizan	i guess i can take their image?
2014-03-17 03:35:12	Saizan	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+morphism <- i guess i can read this
2014-03-17 03:40:14	engimo	yes, you should read that
2014-03-17 03:40:21	engimo	or just google "representable functor"
2014-03-17 03:40:30	engimo	this is peripheral to the Yoneda lemma
2014-03-17 03:41:58	Saizan	well, i know that a representable functor is isomorphic to Hom(c,-) for some c, how to translate this to natural transformations is my problem
2014-03-17 03:42:39	engimo	like i said, a natural transformation is a morphism between functors
2014-03-17 03:44:15	Saizan	yeah, but how is it a functor?
2014-03-17 03:45:10	engimo	there is a set of natural transformations between two functors
2014-03-17 03:45:42	imprimable	isn't it just yoneda lemma ?
2014-03-17 03:45:48	engimo	isn't what
2014-03-17 03:45:54	imprimable	the question Saizan is asking
2014-03-17 03:46:05	engimo	he's asking "how is a natural transformation a functor"
2014-03-17 03:46:15	engimo	which has nothing to do with the yoneda lemma
2014-03-17 03:46:26	imprimable	i mean, the representable part
2014-03-17 03:46:29	imprimable	maybe i misunderstood
2014-03-17 03:46:54	engimo	no, not really
2014-03-17 03:47:11	Saizan	engimo: by functor i mean "morphism between categories"
2014-03-17 03:47:48	engimo	yes, what else could you mean
2014-03-17 03:48:57	Saizan	engimo: ok, so, if i have a nat. trans. eta : F -> G, and i want to see it as a functor, between which categories is it?
2014-03-17 03:49:49	engimo	oh, i see what you're asking
2014-03-17 03:52:17	Saizan	does it make sense? if i get there i can apply the notion of representable functor to natural transformations
2014-03-17 03:52:58	Saizan	maybe that's misguided though
2014-03-17 03:54:59	engimo	the only thing i could imagine that meaning is that
2014-03-17 03:55:10	engimo	the natural transformation is one induced by a map in the underlying category
2014-03-17 03:55:42	imprimable	Saizan: well just take the induced diagrams of F and G
2014-03-17 03:55:43	engimo	e.g. if we have a map A -> B, then we get an induced natural transformation of functors Hom(-, A) -> Hom(-,B)
2014-03-17 03:55:45	imprimable	they form a category
2014-03-17 03:55:56	imprimable	and your natural transformation between those diagrams would be a functor right ?
2014-03-17 03:56:08	engimo	but there are other natural transformations between Hom(-,A) and Hom(-,B), conceivably
2014-03-17 03:56:19	engimo	the representable ones are perhaps the ones coming from maps A -> B
2014-03-17 03:58:44	Saizan	http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+morphism#definition <- mh, i'll see if i can gain some intuition from that pullback
2014-03-17 03:59:17	Saizan	i wonder if that definition implies that F and G are representable
2014-03-17 03:59:47	engimo	fucking nlab
2014-03-17 04:00:11	Saizan	why?:D
2014-03-17 04:01:34	engimo	if a website could be autistic
2014-03-17 04:03:11	Saizan	heh, it doesn't look like this page has seen much work

2014-03-17 04:11:41	Saizan	i guess the pullback object has to be a representable presheaf there for the definition to make sense
2014-03-17 04:12:03	engimo	zzzz
2014-03-17 04:12:19	engimo	lets go back to why you care in the first place
2014-03-17 04:14:22	Saizan	well, because of models of type theory, specifically "categories with families"
2014-03-17 04:14:45	Saizan	i was trying to see what the first talk in that workshop pointed at

2014-03-25 01:55:58	imprimable	i'm not sure to understand what's the point of a monad
2014-03-25 01:56:00	imprimable	:
2014-03-25 01:56:41	imprimable	is it just a way to characterize the fact that there exists an adjunction ?
2014-03-25 01:56:48	imprimable	ie, if i find a monad, therefore, i find an adjunction ?
2014-03-25 01:59:17	engimo	no
2014-03-25 01:59:38	engimo	there are various types of resolutions associated to monads, which may be nice
2014-03-25 01:59:59	engimo	moreover, there are peripheral things like the barr-beck theorem, which let you analyze potentially complicated categories
2014-03-25 02:00:06	imprimable	what do you call a resolution ?
2014-03-25 02:00:34	engimo	uh, if you don't know what that means already i don't know what to tell you
2014-03-25 02:00:40	tomprince	imprimable: Have you seen algebras for a moand yet?
2014-03-25 02:00:40	engimo	an example is the bar resolution, which maybe you have seen
2014-03-25 02:00:55	imprimable	tomprince: no, just the definition and the two main theorems related to adjunction
2014-03-25 02:01:31	tomprince	imprimable: monads are a very good example of something that you can't understand, without just accepting that they exist, and going on to see how they get used.
2014-03-25 02:01:50	imprimable	ok
2014-03-25 02:01:58	imprimable	so i need to see some example adn continue to work with them
2014-03-25 02:02:09	tomprince	Or, at least, I don't know any intrinsic motivation of a monad.
2014-03-25 02:02:20	imprimable	yes, i can't understand either what motivated it either
2014-03-25 02:02:30	imprimable	unless "is there an adjunction associated to such endofunctor?"
2014-03-25 02:03:07	imprimable	but it doesn't give you the category from which the adjunction comes from so
2014-03-25 02:03:12	imprimable	its just an existential criterion
2014-03-25 02:03:27	tomprince	There are multiple possible such categories.
2014-03-25 02:03:37	imprimable	yes, and its not unique
2014-03-25 02:03:43	engimo	tomprince: i take it you don't know much topology
2014-03-25 02:03:46	tomprince	They form a category.
2014-03-25 02:04:00	tomprince	I know a fair bit of category theory.
2014-03-25 02:04:07	tomprince	s/category theory/topology/
2014-03-25 02:07:08	engimo	uh... what
2014-03-25 02:07:48	tomprince	engimo: I know a fair bit of topology.
2014-03-25 02:08:08	-->	madjestic (~madjestic@188.90.175.72) has joined ##categorytheory
2014-03-25 02:08:12	engimo	then you shouldn't have to think too hard to see why people came up with monads
2014-03-25 02:09:33	tomprince	engimo: Sure. But you can't get there just looking at the definition of a monad.
2014-03-25 02:09:48	engimo	sure, but you can say that about, well, most things
2014-03-25 02:09:57	engimo	what's a hopf algebra doing idk
2014-03-25 02:10:14	engimo	few things have "intrinsic motivation"
2014-03-25 02:10:26	imprimable	well, hopf algebra are easily motivated
2014-03-25 02:10:26	engimo	and if you think they do, its probably because you are not recognizing your own motivation
2014-03-25 02:10:27	ystael	engimo: clearly, skipfing and jumpfing
2014-03-25 02:10:30	engimo	so are monads
2014-03-25 02:10:30	imprimable	as self dual structure
2014-03-25 02:11:35	mr-	engimo: what's your topological motivation for monads?
2014-03-25 02:11:42	engimo	mr-: the bar construction
2014-03-25 02:11:52	engimo	maybe One Of The Most Useful Things
2014-03-25 02:12:13	mr-	ah, group completion?
2014-03-25 02:12:24	engimo	but there are more obvious things that are not coming from topology, e.g. free/forgetful adjunction between abelian groups and sets presents abelian groups as algebras over a monad
2014-03-25 02:12:28	engimo	no, not group completion
2014-03-25 02:12:32	engimo	the bar construction
2014-03-25 02:12:53	mr-	Classifying spaces?
2014-03-25 02:13:03	engimo	that's an example of a bar construction, yes
2014-03-25 02:13:21	engimo	BG, for G an abelian group, is a bar construction
2014-03-25 02:13:28	engimo	and, well, if you don't know what those are useful for, i don't know what to say
2014-03-25 02:13:50	tomprince	engimo: I agree that you can't often find intrinsic motivations for things.
2014-03-25 02:14:15	mr-	Sure, BG is awesome.
2014-03-25 02:14:31	tomprince	Which is why I've been trying to convince imprimable that e shouldn't try to understand everything in its entirety, before moving on to the next.
2014-03-25 02:14:49	tomprince	Because often moving on to the next thing is what allows you to understand the thing that you moved on from.
2014-03-25 02:14:54	engimo	sure
2014-03-25 02:15:10	engimo	i find it better to follow the trajectory that led people to think of a thing
2014-03-25 02:15:12	mr-	I've never really seen B- as a monadic thing
2014-03-25 02:16:15	engimo	mr-: it's not a great example of it, it's B(*,G,*)
2014-03-25 02:16:41	engimo	EG is given by B(*,G,G), also
2014-03-25 02:16:50	engimo	the nice thing is that you get simplicial models for these things, which actually lets you compute
2014-03-25 02:16:58	engimo	otherwise, well, wtf else are you gonna do
2014-03-25 02:17:16	engimo	this model also gives rise to, say, the bockstein spectral sequence
2014-03-25 02:18:13	engimo	wrong name, i thought that's what the homotopy fixed point ss was called,
2014-03-25 02:18:16	engimo	whatever that thing is
2014-03-25 02:18:58	mr-	Ah, if M is a monad, MA -> A an algebra then the bar resolution is ... MMA -> MA -> A (the simplicial object)
2014-03-25 02:19:29	engimo	yes
2014-03-25 02:19:40	engimo	you also have cosimplicial resolutions associated to comonads
2014-03-25 02:20:00	engimo	if you know the adams spectral sequence, that's basically coming from this sort of thing
2014-03-25 02:20:46	mr-	And the monad for BG is just Gx_, the algebra G -> * or GxG -> G, the second probably being EG
2014-03-25 02:21:17	mr-	Yeah, I have seen the simplicial object for the Adams spectral sequence before.. but nobody ever says that we have a monad there
2014-03-25 02:21:35	engimo	sure
2014-03-25 02:21:52	mr-	*grumble*
2014-03-25 02:21:57	engimo	given a ring spectrum R and a fixed spectrum X
2014-03-25 02:22:20	engimo	there is a free-forgetful adjunction from spectra/R-modules, given by smashing X with R over the sphere spectrum
2014-03-25 02:22:42	engimo	if you then forget, you have a unit map X -> X ^ R
2014-03-25 02:23:35	engimo	apply this to, say, R = HF_2, then you get a resolution of an arbitrary ring spectrum by HF_2-algebras, and, well, that might be nice
2014-03-25 02:23:57	engimo	(because of, idk, steenrod operations)
2014-03-25 02:24:01	mr-	Sure.
2014-03-25 02:24:34	engimo	that's the general idea, but i don't know much about stable homotopy theory so don't ask me anything else
2014-03-25 02:25:05	mr-	There are bound to be examples in homological algebra too. Are some of the known resolutions secretely bar?

2014-03-25 02:25:14	engimo	something more germane to my life is if you take R = HZ, then you have a resolution of (connective) ring spectra by HZ-algebras, which are Quillen equivalent to simplicial rings
2014-03-25 02:25:20	engimo	mr-: oh, certainly
2014-03-25 02:25:36	engimo	this is a prime example of People Not Telling You Things And Fuck Them
2014-03-25 02:26:57	mr-	Ok, I'll just have to keep my eyes open :-)
2014-03-25 02:27:37	engimo	yes
2014-03-25 02:28:05	engimo	turns out: people are p. bad at exposition
2014-03-25 02:29:05	mr-	I don't know.. many people are afraid of CT. So dropping the M-word in a third year homological algebra course might be a little rough
2014-03-25 02:30:06	engimo	if people are already on board with doing homological algebra, it shouldn't be too hard to motivate
2014-03-25 02:31:27	mr-	Anyway.. I would have like to know. So screw them!
2014-03-25 02:31:34	engimo	i don't know, a perspective on all this stuff is much more understandable if one knows some of the story of quillen's invention of model categories
2014-03-25 02:33:12	mr-	Yes, there is a lot of beauty there. Cohomology: Sometimes you resolve the space (cech cohomology), or you resolve the sheaf
2014-03-25 02:34:07	engimo	well, i meant to suggest that you are doing some sort of (co)fibrant resolution when you are doing these bar resolutions
2014-03-25 02:34:29	mr-	Yes, I meant to say that too :-)

2014-03-25 04:01:51	imprimable	that at first doesn't make sense

2014-03-25 04:07:08	tomprince	imprimable: That is the same as asking that (-).g = g
2014-03-25 04:07:19	imprimable	tomprince: you're right
2014-03-25 04:07:37	imprimable	dwcook: there is one initial elements in Set, many terminals
2014-03-25 04:07:38	dwcook	I don't see how. Can't you take objects onto the same objects in the opposite category and back, and arrows onto the reversed arrows and back?
2014-03-25 04:07:48	imprimable	so in Sets^op it is the opposite
2014-03-25 04:07:59	tomprince	Which is an action of a pointed set, with the law that the action of the distinguished point is the identity.
2014-03-25 04:08:09	imprimable	k, let me google that tomprince :>
2014-03-25 04:08:14	tomprince	dwcook: That isn't a functor.
2014-03-25 04:08:34	tomprince	because it doesn't preserve composition.
2014-03-25 04:08:48	dwcook	Oh!
2014-03-25 04:09:52	dwcook	Ah, I thought I understood, but I don't. What's an example of that not respecting composition?
2014-03-25 04:10:12	imprimable	F(f°g) = F(g)°F(f) dwcook
2014-03-25 04:10:17	imprimable	its a contravariant functor
2014-03-25 04:11:13	imprimable	A->B->D in C becomes FA<-FB<-FD in C^op
2014-03-25 04:11:44	tomprince	dwcook: The only case where it would respect composition is if your category was a disjoint union of abelian groups viewed as one-object categories.
2014-03-25 04:12:33	imprimable	aren't C and C^op naturally isomorphic ?
2014-03-25 04:12:55	imprimable	equivalent i mean
2014-03-25 04:14:26	tomprince	No. Almost never.
2014-03-25 04:15:41	imprimable	C and D are naturally isomorphic if there exists a essentially surjective, full and faithful functor from C to D
2014-03-25 04:16:01	imprimable	maybe it fails because of the word "functo" ?
2014-03-25 04:16:02	imprimable	r
2014-03-25 04:16:09	tomprince	yes.
2014-03-25 04:16:10	imprimable	ok
2014-03-25 04:17:25	imprimable	isn't it a concept to invnt to claim that C and C^op are naturally inversly isomorphic ?
2014-03-25 04:17:26	imprimable	:>
2014-03-25 04:18:02	imprimable	we say that C and D are naturally inversly isomorphic if there exists an essentially surjective, full and faithful contravariant functor from C to D
2014-03-25 04:18:13	imprimable	which would gives a criterion to identify C with C^op
2014-03-25 04:18:46	tomprince	For what purpose?
2014-03-25 04:19:05	imprimable	hm you're right its pointless
2014-03-25 04:19:06	imprimable	if you have C
2014-03-25 04:19:07	tomprince	It'd also be confusing, since properties of C don't carry over to properties of C^{op}
2014-03-25 04:19:08	imprimable	by duality
2014-03-25 04:19:09	imprimable	you have C^op
2014-03-25 04:19:19	tomprince	They do carry over to the *dual* properties.
2014-03-25 04:19:22	imprimable	yes, its a useless concept
2014-03-25 04:19:31	tomprince	But then, just say that C^{op} is dual to C.
2014-03-25 04:19:33	imprimable	since if you have C, you already have C^op
2014-03-25 04:19:36	imprimable	yes
2014-03-25 04:20:09	dwcook	I think I'm confused about something. I'm missing how the mappings I mentioned above don't preserve composition.
2014-03-25 04:20:24	imprimable	draw A->B->C dwcook
2014-03-25 04:20:42	imprimable	then, by duality, the opposite category of that is A<-B<-C, right ?
2014-03-25 04:20:43	tomprince	dwcook: It reverse composition.
2014-03-25 04:21:10	dwcook	Oh! Okay, I get it now.

2014-03-25 04:22:23	dwcook	For some reason I wasn't noticing the difference between F(x.y) = F(x).F(y) and F(x.y) = F(y).F(x)
2014-03-25 04:27:43	imprimable	let C be a category with a terminal element
2014-03-25 04:28:11	imprimable	let (C,*) the pointed category, whose objects are the pairs (A, f: 1-> A) of "pointed objects"
2014-03-25 04:28:41	imprimable	how could i define the previous action
2014-03-25 04:28:45	imprimable	a functor is by definition associative
2014-03-25 04:28:48	imprimable	so it won't work
2014-03-25 04:30:16	imprimable	(arrows from (A,f) and (B,g) are the h such that g = h°f)
2014-03-25 04:46:57	imprimable	is there some CT without associativity ?
2014-03-25 04:47:00	imprimable	does it exists ?

2014-03-28 04:04:07	imprimable	can someone explain me why a "group structure", ie, diagram of the form GxG -m-> G <-i-G and with also 1-u-G
2014-03-28 04:04:16	imprimable	without the usual axiom of associativity, inverse and unit
2014-03-28 04:04:53	imprimable	can be seen as a map : 1+ G + GxG -> G
2014-03-28 04:05:28	imprimable	ah
2014-03-28 04:05:32	imprimable	i think i just understood
2014-03-28 04:06:09	imprimable	at least in Sets it wrks
2014-03-28 04:13:18	mr-	Works in every category that has finite coproducts.

2014-03-28 04:15:41	imprimable	i don't understand why
2014-03-28 04:16:08	imprimable	you need a terminal element for it to work right ?
2014-03-28 04:16:17	imprimable	(here it is here so np)
2014-03-28 04:16:31	mr-	Well.. what is a map 1 + G + GxG -> G if not a map 1 -> G, and a map G -> G and a map GxG -> G
2014-03-28 04:16:58	imprimable	wait, let me draw the diagram
2014-03-28 04:17:03	imprimable	you have all product, so you have a terminal element
2014-03-28 04:17:08	imprimable	you have all coproduct
2014-03-28 04:17:10	imprimable	let me draw
2014-03-28 04:18:18	mr-	I don't know what you want to draw. But you should be thinking of the universal property of the coproduct
2014-03-28 04:21:17	imprimable	oh
2014-03-28 04:21:18	imprimable	ok
2014-03-28 04:21:20	imprimable	yes
2014-03-28 04:21:29	imprimable	looks obvious this way
2014-03-28 04:21:47	imprimable	its a coproduct with 3 entries yes
2014-03-28 04:21:49	imprimable	obvious
2014-03-28 04:21:49	imprimable	thx

2014-03-29 01:27:29	imprimable	hi
2014-03-29 01:27:48	imprimable	i would like to know if the theory of operadrs is the good framework to talk about "quotient" of n-ary relations
2014-03-29 01:28:20	engimo	do you mean operads?
2014-03-29 01:29:14	imprimable	operads sorry
2014-03-29 01:29:15	imprimable	yes
2014-03-29 01:29:26	engimo	well i don't know what you mean by the latter part, but probably
2014-03-29 01:29:43	imprimable	i want to be able to "generate" higher algebra from a kind of "quotient"
2014-03-29 01:29:55	imprimable	as one can generate an algebra by quotienting the free algebra by relations
2014-03-29 01:32:53	engimo	that's too impressionistic, can you give an exact example of what you want, and why you want it
2014-03-29 01:34:17	imprimable	ok
2014-03-29 01:34:53	imprimable	suppose i have some alphabet {A, B, /\, ...}
2014-03-29 01:35:10	imprimable	i want to quotient my algebra by the relations that force A /\ B = B /\ A
2014-03-29 01:35:11	imprimable	and so on
2014-03-29 01:35:19	imprimable	in order to be abl to construct inference rules from pure syntax
2014-03-29 01:35:21	imprimable	by successive quotient
2014-03-29 01:35:54	imprimable	(suppose i constructed some kind of "free algebra" before, where A /\ B and stuff, are words on it)
2014-03-29 01:40:33	imprimable	you understand my idea engimo ?
2014-03-29 01:41:17	engimo	sort of
2014-03-29 01:41:45	imprimable	so i need the higher quotient, what allows you to "force" the relations
2014-03-29 01:41:48	engimo	you can do all the sensible constructions you want with operads, e.g. taking quotients of algebras, etc
2014-03-29 01:43:07	imprimable	should i use the course of tom leinster for a first introduction?
2014-03-29 01:44:49	engimo	i don't know who that is
2014-03-29 01:44:55	engimo	may has a book about it
2014-03-29 01:45:42	imprimable	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305049
2014-03-29 01:46:20	engimo	yeah maybe

2014-04-02 16:42:13	NikolajK	Are there any issues with considering the 'class of all cateogries' or the 'class of all functors'? (Note that I don -note- speak of the category of all categories or the category of all functors). Motivation: I want to put functors in a class - mostly because I don't know if they fit in a set, and because I don't quite know what a functor is, if I don't model it via set theory.
2014-04-02 16:44:59	NikolajK	(What is a functor and a natural transformation anyway, in category theory. Maps in a broad sense, and morphisms in a functor category. But if you define them the first time, do you assign them some kind of "type"?)

2014-04-02 16:57:38	NikolajK	I don't mind forming the category of all functors, even if 'all functors' is larger than any the class of all my sets, but I just don't want to be formally inconsistent
2014-04-02 16:59:18	NikolajK	or make a defintion so that what I naively set out to be 'the class of all…' or 'the category of all..' is in fact not a class resp. category.
