2014-03-09 20:06:42	trap_exit	it's not some blog
2014-03-09 20:06:45	lilmonkey	Then you use media queries with breakpoints to adjust for different classes of device sizes.
2014-03-09 20:07:04	trap_exit	I do admit that 'media queries with breakpoints' sounds like something I should learn about
2014-03-09 20:07:14	lilmonkey	But those breakpoints are just a way to TARGET certain classes of devices, your actual CSS should never define pixels.
2014-03-09 20:07:24	Pilum	Never ever.
2014-03-09 20:07:34	Pilum	And fluid design isn't that hard to learn.
2014-03-09 20:07:45	lilmonkey	In fact, it has been argued by several of the original CSS creators that the pixel unit should never have been in CSS, in hindsight.

2014-03-10 03:15:11	MraMaria	Hi. On designing a page I'm having some problems in having a "window.open" "_self" to open only in a section instead of replacing the whole page. Can someone please help me with this? http://ground.dyndns.org/WinOpen/
2014-03-10 03:15:43	MraMaria	I'd appreciate a lot.
2014-03-10 03:16:07	lilmonkey	MraMaria: you're in #html, not ##javascript
2014-03-10 03:16:36	MraMaria	lilmonkey, if I remove all html the page don't work :o
2014-03-10 03:16:40	MraMaria	:)
2014-03-10 03:16:41	lilmonkey	...
2014-03-10 03:16:53	lilmonkey	Take it to ##javascript
2014-03-10 03:16:59	MraMaria	ok :)
2014-03-10 03:17:10	MraMaria	Thanks lilmonkey

2014-03-11 11:54:23	tieTYT2	hello, I've made a table and the first column has a rowspan='3'.  That's working fine, but the problem is that it has an image in it, and the height of that image seems to be determining the height of the first row.  Since it has so much room, I'd prefer that didn't happen.  I'd like it to be as vertically compact as possible.  How can I do that?

2014-03-12 23:44:18	kruug	I'm attempting to get my website working with php includes.  The issue with this is, if I were to include a php file from a higher-level, it seems to act as if the resources (CSS, images, icons, etc) are in the same folder as the page calling the includes as opposed to the element being included.  Is this something I can fix in the HTML code?

2014-03-12 23:56:12	kruug	should I be changing them to absolute paths to correct this?
2014-03-12 23:58:39	Pilum	Or paths relative to the root directory.

2014-03-15 08:16:41	nullbytes	I am adding a large number (thousands) of spans to the page. At a regular interval, some of the spans need to be hidden or shown. I am currently setting their visibility through css. However, I also need to change the order of the spans at a regular interval. Is removing all of the spans from the page and reinserting the visible ones the most efficient way to filter and sort the spans?

2014-03-15 09:11:30	[Visage]	Spark, xsl, but really, XHTML is dead, and XML is terribad.
2014-03-15 09:12:55	Spark	xhtml is dead?
2014-03-15 09:13:20	Spark	i looked at xsl but it seemed to be a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of complexity, for little power
2014-03-15 09:13:35	Spark	I am actually thinking now about maybe some sort of python script that does the xml -> html
2014-03-15 09:14:03	Spark	I want to start with XML because I have a lot of english prose that I want to put structure around, as well as more structural things
2014-03-15 09:14:24	Spark	the other end just needs to be something that is viewable in a browser, but it's static content so html seems pretty reasonable
2014-03-15 09:17:05	Spark	But, if I write a python script that generates HTML, it's going to be hard to 'see' the HTML in the python code
2014-03-15 09:17:27	Spark	Maybe django or something?  Assuming I can get access to the XML tree inside there

Some websites it resets every time you refresh with all the  tags closed. Does this make sense? Anyone know what causes this?

2014-03-16 05:52:13	lilmonkey`	There's a reason XSLT failed hard.
2014-03-16 05:52:25	Spark	the only reason i say xml is because i want a markup language, where most of it is english prose

2014-03-16 05:53:38	Spark	this is what confuses me
2014-03-16 05:53:55	Spark	Maybe django is what I want?
2014-03-16 05:54:07	lilmonkey`	Django... what does that have to do with anything?
2014-03-16 05:54:14	lilmonkey`	Django is a web framework.
2014-03-16 05:54:15	Spark	its template language instead of xml
2014-03-16 05:54:55	lilmonkey`	Either way, if your data isn't already in XML format, forget XML.
2014-03-16 05:55:05	Visage	^^
2014-03-16 05:58:03	Spark	i'm just going to put an example in pastebin
2014-03-16 06:01:10	Spark	http://codepad.org/Oga4t0sp
2014-03-16 06:01:12	Spark	this is literally it
2014-03-16 06:01:22	Spark	so you can see how i don't really care if it's xml or not
2014-03-16 06:01:47	Spark	it'd be nice to be able to just do blank lines instead of <p></p> but i could live without that
2014-03-16 06:02:29	lilmonkey`	Spark: I guess you're not familiar with XSLT?
2014-03-16 06:03:18	Spark	i looked at it, but it looked pretty awful
2014-03-16 06:03:26	lilmonkey`	Yes. Of course. It's XML.
2014-03-16 06:03:34	Spark	i didn't really understand how to get it to replace e.g. <chapter> there with a bunch of stuff
2014-03-16 06:03:38	lilmonkey`	But it's what you want, unless I'm totally misunderstanding you.
2014-03-16 06:03:44	Spark	i don't want to write everything in xml, just the input
2014-03-16 06:03:51	lilmonkey`	..
2014-03-16 06:03:57	Spark	in fact i don't really care about having the input in xml
2014-03-16 06:04:03	lilmonkey`	Okay well, time to start learning XSLT.
2014-03-16 06:04:06	Spark	since the amount of markup is what... 1% or something
2014-03-16 06:04:08	lilmonkey`	More in #xml
2014-03-16 06:04:40	lilmonkey`	We already went over this. If your data isn't already in XML format, you should forget about XML.

2014-03-16 06:05:21	lilmonkey`	For what, exactly?
2014-03-16 06:05:48	Spark	I'm going to write a lot of this kind of stuff: http://codepad.org/Oga4t0sp
2014-03-16 06:05:52	lilmonkey`	Your original question doesn't apply anymore if XML is no longer involved.
2014-03-16 06:06:44	Spark	the input format is flexible, except that it shouldn't be any more ugly than in that pastebin, and the output format is a static webpage, i'm just trying to work out how to make that work
2014-03-16 06:07:11	Spark	xslt looked like it was going to be more ugly than hacking up some python to emit html
2014-03-16 06:07:19	lilmonkey`	No doubt.
2014-03-16 06:07:31	lilmonkey`	So yeah, just pick any template language.
2014-03-16 06:07:48	lilmonkey`	For python probably jinga :)
2014-03-16 06:08:17	Spark	heh jinga does look a lot like django
2014-03-16 06:08:40	lilmonkey`	..
2014-03-16 06:08:41	lilmonkey`	Again
2014-03-16 06:08:46	lilmonkey`	Django is a web framework
2014-03-16 06:08:51	lilmonkey`	Not a template language

2014-03-16 06:09:29	Spark	hmm, i've used it before (or thought I was using it) and it involved writing a lot of {% %}
2014-03-16 06:09:37	Spark	was I actually doing something else then?
2014-03-16 06:10:05	Spark	does it use jinga internally or something like that?
2014-03-16 06:10:28	lilmonkey`	Probably.
2014-03-16 06:10:56	Spark	this is what i remember: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/overview/#design-your-templates
2014-03-16 06:11:01	Spark	that syntax
2014-03-16 06:11:08	Spark	looks identical to http://jinja.pocoo.org/
2014-03-16 06:11:33	lilmonkey`	FWIW, many template languages have similar syntax
2014-03-16 06:11:46	lilmonkey`	And many can have their syntax configured.
2014-03-16 06:11:48	Spark	now i've actually read the page, it says "It is inspired by Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools."
2014-03-16 06:11:53	lilmonkey`	So that doesn't mean much.
2014-03-16 06:13:04	Spark	so I would write http://codepad.org/Oga4t0sp in the jinga template syntax, and I would also write a bunch more jinga to define the translation to html?  Is that how it works?
2014-03-16 06:13:45	<--	circuit (~daniel@bas1-newmarket85-1177654283.dsl.bell.ca) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2014-03-16 06:13:50	lilmonkey`	No, you supply the template with a data object, and the template has placeholders that correspond with fields on the object.
2014-03-16 06:15:02	Spark	so they have some sort of data model as well
2014-03-16 06:15:12	lilmonkey`	Yes
2014-03-16 06:15:33	lilmonkey`	Or not, depending on what you mean..
2014-03-16 06:15:35	lilmonkey`	:)
2014-03-16 06:17:38	Spark	my mental model was kinda like "just replace bits in the page" but i see that's not actually enough because you can't make top-level structural changes that way
2014-03-16 06:17:43	Spark	you can't put a list of contents at the top for example
2014-03-16 06:17:53	lilmonkey`	What
2014-03-16 06:18:14	Spark	i'm sure it's obvious to you
2014-03-16 06:18:25	Spark	i just hadn't considered it
2014-03-16 06:18:39	lilmonkey`	I have no idea what you're on about
2014-03-16 06:19:14	Spark	I need to think about the input as "a list of chapters, where a chapter is a list of paragraphs or images, or subchapters"
2014-03-16 06:19:34	Spark	and then that whole thing is processed and reassembled potentially arbitrarily
2014-03-16 06:20:52	Spark	whereas I was previously thinking of it more as just "high level html", which would be dropped into the middle of some web page to provide the actual content
2014-03-16 06:21:05	Spark	anyway, yeah this looks like it'll do what I want, thanks
2014-03-16 06:22:51	lilmonkey`	Spark: yes, well, if your content is always "document"-style content, I wouldn't actually recommend that.
2014-03-16 06:23:22	lilmonkey`	Document content shouldn't be authored like it's data.
2014-03-16 06:23:38	lilmonkey`	(arbitrary data, that is)

2014-03-16 06:24:40	Spark	so, I could for example, write xml like in that pastebin, have a python program to parse the xml, then write a little bit of code to conert it to whatever the jinga api wants, and then execute the template to generate the page on that data
2014-03-16 06:24:48	lilmonkey`	You're probably better off with a markup language that you can extend for your needs, someting like markdown.
2014-03-16 06:25:12	Spark	oh, markdown looks ideal
2014-03-16 06:25:17	lilmonkey`	Or textile, or restructured text
2014-03-16 06:25:41	Spark	it's like wiki syntaxes
2014-03-16 06:25:46	lilmonkey`	Yes
2014-03-16 06:25:49	lilmonkey`	But better :)
2014-03-16 06:25:51	Spark	i have found them to be often very annoying

2014-03-16 06:31:26	Spark	it's more just a change of syntax, not a high level vs low level thing
2014-03-16 06:31:35	lilmonkey`	I don't know off-hand, some implementations may expose functionality to let you modify this.

2014-03-16 06:32:16	lilmonkey`	I know there are markup languages that let you define custom 'tags' which let you do exactly what you want.
2014-03-16 06:32:47	lilmonkey`	Can't name any off-hand though, but they exist. :)
2014-03-16 06:33:29	Spark	coldfusion?
2014-03-16 06:33:33	lilmonkey`	lol
2014-03-16 06:33:44	lilmonkey`	Please don't just shout random names
2014-03-16 06:33:54	Spark	there is too much technology
2014-03-16 06:35:46	lilmonkey`	You can still use a template engine, but you shouldn't supply (and think of), say, paragraphs as individual bits of data that you stuff into an array or something.
2014-03-16 06:36:32	Spark	it seemed like that was a requirement
2014-03-16 06:36:42	Spark	i don't understand why that's bad though
2014-03-16 06:36:48	Spark	does it make the templates hard to write?
2014-03-16 06:37:34	lilmonkey`	If you're gonna use a template engine, you should have fields for pieces of content that you can logically separate. E.g. at the top level an array of chapters, each chapter having, say, a title field and a content field, with the content field holding the actual markup as, say, '<p>bla bla</p> <p>bla bla</p>.
2014-03-16 06:37:46	lilmonkey`	But that gets very complex and unwieldy very quickly.
2014-03-16 06:37:58	lilmonkey`	It works in data-driven websites/apps.
2014-03-16 06:38:04	lilmonkey`	But not in document-driven ones.

2014-03-17 05:30:52	p3lim	Like, the nearest input or something
2014-03-17 05:30:54	lilmonkey`	p3lim: you can nest the control inside of the label element.

2014-03-17 05:38:56	p3lim	That messes with my css though, I had this: input:checked + label:before {...}
2014-03-17 05:39:52	lilmonkey`	Um yeah, so change your CSS accordingly? Derp.
2014-03-17 05:40:03	p3lim	Just unsure how
2014-03-17 05:40:09	lilmonkey`	Well, #css for that.
2014-03-17 05:40:14	p3lim	Figured
2014-03-17 05:40:58	lilmonkey`	But sure, with changed markup, not all CSS techniques may work anymore :)
2014-03-17 05:41:25	lilmonkey`	At the end of the day, though, it's alway easy enough to jusr supply matching for/id attributes.
2014-03-17 05:43:12	p3lim	Sure, but I want to do it without using ids preferably
2014-03-17 05:46:17	Aero	I forget which version it was, but does IE 8 and less not display png-8s at all?
2014-03-17 05:46:57	Aero	or was it IE 6 and less?
2014-03-17 05:48:02	lilmonkey`	PNG8 is supported by IE5+.

2014-03-17 21:32:50	fabioportieri	hello
2014-03-17 21:33:12	fabioportieri	having this doctype <!-- DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" -->  can i put <link> for css outside head tag?
2014-03-17 21:33:28	<--	bodyows (~body@188.24.63.216) has left #html
2014-03-17 21:34:23	fabioportieri	it seems to work but i'm wondering if it's better to put it into the main page (in this project the mainpage is like a template, and it's css/js are loaded for every subpage)
2014-03-17 21:39:34	fabioportieri	you have permission to speak
2014-03-17 21:43:10	Fleck	thank you! :D

2014-03-17 22:06:53	Visage	fabioportieri, Wrong doctype. You want <!doctype html> these days.
2014-03-17 22:07:13	Visage	You most certainly aren't transitioning from HTML 3.2.
2014-03-17 22:07:32	fabioportieri	Visage: i know but the project is huge and if i change doctype the whole layout messes up.. i'm not allowed to do so for now
2014-03-17 22:07:37	Visage	And no, <link> goes in <head>, always.
2014-03-17 22:07:44	fabioportieri	ok, thanks
2014-03-17 22:08:03	Visage	fabioportieri, ...And have you TRIED changing the doctype?
2014-03-17 22:08:20	fabioportieri	Visage: yes, and i noticed that
2014-03-17 22:08:23	Visage	Y'know, to <!doctype html>, as was previously mentioned. You're going to have to do it eventually anyway.
2014-03-17 22:08:32	Visage	This really isn't 1999 anymore.
2014-03-17 22:08:37	fabioportieri	Visage: not my project, not my responsability

2014-03-17 22:09:03	fabioportieri	ehe

2014-03-18 02:42:19	uskerine	hi, this might be a bit off-topic, but still related to web. Is it possible to assign "m.foo.com" to "www.foo.com/mobile"? so, in www.foo.com/index.html  I can check for mobile device and launch the mobile version located at www.foo.com/mobile/index.html while user is seeing m.foo.com/index.html. Thanks!

The id attribute is typically used for referencing elements in CSS or some scripting language, and the name attribute is typically used for referencing form data that has been submitted to a server.

2014-03-20 05:06:38	Moult	lilmonkey`: sure, i'm currently using mustache, but haml seems to do much more than just a templating language. it redefines the html syntax quite drastically. i haven't seen a templating language which does this before
2014-03-20 05:07:45	Visage	Then you haven't looked around much. :)
2014-03-20 05:07:47	lilmonkey`	It doesn't redefine HTML syntax, it just has its own syntax which compiles to HTML. Anyway, it's certainly not the only such language.
2014-03-20 05:08:20	lilmonkey`	Also, Mustache is *specfically* is "logicless" templating language, Haml is not.
2014-03-20 05:08:50	lilmonkey`	That's why it seems very different, but they're really just on different ends of a scale.
2014-03-20 05:09:18	lilmonkey`	In general, you should put as little logic in templates as reasonably possible.
2014-03-20 05:09:55	lilmonkey`	But no, Haml and Mustache are most definitely the same kind of tool.

2014-03-20 05:23:27	stlstude_	what is the best way (or is there a way) to make a <tr> element span the width of two <td> elements?
2014-03-20 05:24:17	lilmonkey`	stlstude_: that doesn't even make any sense
2014-03-20 05:24:46	stlstude_	i'm trying to insert an element into a table. ideally it would be a div
2014-03-20 05:24:56	lilmonkey`	Now you're making even less sense.
2014-03-20 05:26:27	stlstude_	well, perhaps a more helpful response about what you need from me to improve my question would lead to less frustration for both of us
2014-03-20 05:26:45	lilmonkey`	I have a better idea.
2014-03-20 05:26:47	stlstude_	i may be looking for colspan, i suppose

2014-03-20 23:17:26	gordian	basically i want one set of radio buttons and two actions
2014-03-20 23:17:51	gordian	and i'd like to not use JavaScript
2014-03-20 23:19:20	Pilum	You could have it all in one form I suppose.
2014-03-20 23:19:57	gordian	but then have two submit buttons in one form?
2014-03-20 23:20:10	gordian	how would each one submit for a unique action?
2014-03-20 23:20:30	Pilum	The submit button which is used will be transmitted.
2014-03-20 23:21:05	gordian	huh?
2014-03-20 23:21:13	gordian	but if it's all in one form then there can only be one form action
2014-03-20 23:21:24	gordian	and i need each button to submit to a different URL
2014-03-20 23:21:24	Pilum	Yes. You'd need to handle it serverside.

2014-03-21 08:27:19	gde33	example was provided   http://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/pu46g/1/
2014-03-21 08:27:22	Visage	Because a textarea is a multi-line input. :)
2014-03-21 08:27:34	CoJaBo	gde33: ..why not put in in Javascript vars?
2014-03-21 08:27:46	gde33	javascript doesnt have a cool way to read multi line data into variables
2014-03-21 08:28:03	gde33	you have to escape the line end\
2014-03-21 08:28:16	gde33	['or contain everything', 'in silly wrappers']
2014-03-21 08:28:55	CoJaBo	you could put it in a data-* attribute
2014-03-21 08:28:58	gde33	the best you can have is a /* comment */ inside a function
2014-03-21 08:29:21	gde33	sure, but what element to use? The script it self?
2014-03-21 08:29:34	gde33	I really did wish I could access sub nodes of script :D
2014-03-21 08:29:44	gde33	but it doesnt do that :D
2014-03-21 08:29:55	CoJaBo	any element that can legally have data-* attributes..
2014-03-21 08:30:05	Visage	CoJaBo, That would be "all of them." :)
2014-03-21 08:30:06	CoJaBo	which frankly might be all of them

2014-03-21 08:31:26	CoJaBo	..what was your question?
2014-03-21 08:31:37	gde33	what kind of node to use
2014-03-21 08:31:48	CoJaBo	Any.
2014-03-21 08:33:12	gde33	wait...
2014-03-21 08:33:25	gde33	I cant use data- ofc because it doesn't have sub nodes
2014-03-21 08:33:36	CoJaBo	the hell is a sub-node?
2014-03-21 08:33:43	gde33	child nodes
2014-03-21 08:34:14	CoJaBo	..?
2014-03-21 08:34:26	gde33	if you have a function say     foo = function(){}

2014-03-21 08:35:10	CoJaBo	There is nothing in the spec to say that should happen.

2014-03-21 08:37:12	CoJaBo	Why?
2014-03-21 08:37:18	gde33	so I just inject it somewhere in the page then read the div from it
2014-03-21 08:37:26	gde33	easy as pie
2014-03-21 08:37:37	CoJaBo	That's literally the most retarded roundabout way of doing something I've ever seen
2014-03-21 08:37:55	gde33	dont worry about it :D
2014-03-21 08:38:12	gde33	you can put commas behind 1000 lines if you prefer
2014-03-21 08:39:00	CoJaBo	You should embed the function in the low-order bits of a GIF and read it out with the <canvas> API

2014-03-21 08:40:13	CoJaBo	Then encode that GIF into a series of QR codes, store them in an OGG/Theora stream (one per frame), and use the media APIs to get and decode the GIF.
2014-03-21 08:40:28	gde33	I did that last time already
2014-03-21 08:41:09	CoJaBo	Hm, and it still didn't win the Rube Goldberg competition? Judges must be pretty tough.f.
2014-03-21 08:41:56	gde33	this was my best one   http://img.go-here.nl/2mgnt3rotaryhaxeasy2.jpg

2014-03-21 08:44:48	CoJaBo	Then modify a flying-spot camera to scan the frames, using the mic port as input; you can use the HTML5 audio-capture APIs to interface with it.
2014-03-21 08:45:23	gde33	well, if you want to preserve data you should carve it deep into stone some place far away from the humans

2014-03-22 04:42:25	sayotte	I have a load-balancer in front of my web-server, which redirects the user to a static landing page when the web-server is down
2014-03-22 04:43:27	sayotte	the landing page's URI is exactly the same as the login page, so that the user (in theory) can just hit F5 once the web-server is up and get the login page
2014-03-22 04:43:30	sayotte	but
2014-03-22 04:43:56	sayotte	the user's browser of course caches the landing page, and sends a GET with an If-Modified-Since header

2014-03-23 00:07:36	Leckoren	python is easier to work with on the OS site, php easier on the Web
2014-03-23 00:07:43	Leckoren	OS side**

2014-03-23 04:43:44	anddam	if you're implying there's a more proper way to do that just suggest it straight away
2014-03-23 04:44:06	lilmonkey	SVG itself provides that functionality, and better.
2014-03-23 04:44:18	lilmonkey	SVg *is* an interactive format, you know.
2014-03-23 04:45:07	anddam	I read http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/dom.html#interactive-content-0 and got that for user interaction in HTML I had to use one of those two
2014-03-23 04:45:11	anddam	img or object
2014-03-23 04:45:43	anddam	is "format" a specific term there?

2014-03-23 04:57:57	anddam	that's suggesting that rolling eyes is more useful than actual help
2014-03-23 04:58:22	anddam	Visage: by reading this http://stackoverflow.com/a/8496875/434206 seems it can be done
2014-03-23 04:58:27	anddam	and it actually works
2014-03-23 04:58:43	lilmonkey	anddam: don't be silly. Anyway, to answer your original question... if you embed an external SVg through <object>, it is exactly what you would expect it to be: a separate document. You can access it the way you can access the DOM of any embedded document (e.g. an <iframe>), provided it satisfies the Same Origin Policy.

2014-03-23 05:06:37	anddam	what's the suggested way to embed an external SVG file?
2014-03-23 05:06:46	lilmonkey	<object>
2014-03-23 05:07:54	anddam	the alternative being writing the elements from the SVG file into a <svg> element in HTML, right?

2014-03-23 05:08:21	lilmonkey	*An* alternative. You can embed SVG in <img>, <embed> (not recommended) and even <iframe>.
2014-03-23 05:08:41	anddam	yes, that I figured from http://www.schepers.cc/svg/blendups/embedding.html
2014-03-23 05:08:46	lilmonkey	Then stop asking.
2014-03-23 05:08:48	lilmonkey	Twat.
2014-03-23 05:08:51	anddam	is one of those preferred?
2014-03-23 05:09:03	lilmonkey	I already told you what is preferred.
2014-03-23 05:09:09	lilmonkey	Are you done being obnoxious?
2014-03-23 05:09:51	anddam	I'm really thorn if you should just tell you to fuck off or not, since you seems to like going personal
2014-03-23 05:10:00	anddam	but I guess I'll just leave
2014-03-23 05:10:03	lilmonkey	Alrighty then.

2014-03-23 18:23:22	lilmonkey	Also, in the case of Same Origin, that's still not all you have to do: both documents have to explicitly opt-in to being able to access eachother's DOM by setting `documen.domain` to the shared domain or subdomain, e.g. if one doc is at foo.com/something and the other at bar.foo.com/something, they both have to set `document.domain = 'foo.com'

2014-03-24 07:25:23	slu9freek	I have a brief About article I'm writing in HTML5 (have out of necessity, half to learn the new standard) and I feel like there's a bunch of different ways to do it, but I'm not sure which is best.
2014-03-24 07:26:06	slu9freek	Theres a heading and 3 sections, each section has "See Also" in details tags and 1 section has a subsection as an aside, does that sound right?
2014-03-24 07:26:42	slu9freek	Since the sections are short (1 h3 tag and 1 paragraph) should I just do away with the section tags>
2014-03-24 07:26:42	lilmonkey	Show code :)
2014-03-24 07:26:54	lilmonkey	Length has nothing to do with meaning.
2014-03-24 07:27:19	lilmonkey	A single word could be a paragraph or section.

2014-03-24 07:28:42	slu9freek	The outliner (http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py) gives me a root with an untitled section tho... is that bad?
2014-03-24 07:29:47	lilmonkey	Aside from that, your code is fine.
2014-03-24 07:30:39	slu9freek	lilmonkey: thanks. do you know how i could fix that? or is it not something to worry about?
2014-03-24 07:30:52	lilmonkey	I don't know what the current status of the outline algo is, it's been controversial.
2014-03-24 07:32:56	slu9freek	lilmonkey: I see... just curious, is there a benefit to using section tags in my context as opposed to just having h1 p h2 p details ... h2 p etc?
2014-03-24 07:33:51	lilmonkey	For your specific code, aside from gaining the benefit of being able to use H1's exclusively for any heading level, no.
2014-03-24 07:34:29	slu9freek	lilmonkey: what is the point of section then?

2014-03-24 07:40:08	slu9freek	lilmonkey: so each section could have its own header/footer, and if I choose to have them, then I should have each heading be an h1. sounds like the common comparison of section/article isnt as relevant as section/h2-h6
2014-03-24 07:40:39	lilmonkey	No, you can still use h2-6 instead if you wish, but you have to pick one method.

2014-03-24 07:41:55	lilmonkey	In complex documents/sites, and especially if external content / UGC is involved, the h2-6 approach just doesn't work.
2014-03-24 07:42:11	slu9freek	lilmonkey: I'm opting in to keep the sections with h1s instead. my browser actually makes the h1s smaller (which I like)!
2014-03-24 07:42:15	lilmonkey	Explicit sectioning with H1's only solves that issue.

2014-03-24 07:42:38	lilmonkey	Yes, all borwsers now have HTML5-aware default style sheets.

2014-03-24 07:42:52	slu9freek	ah
2014-03-24 07:43:20	slu9freek	is it ever appropriate to have artcles within sections?
2014-03-24 07:43:27	lilmonkey	Yes

2014-03-24 07:45:16	slu9freek	Ah, I see.. but an article is supposed to make sense on its own right? doesnt a comment need the article to make sense?
2014-03-24 07:45:58	lilmonkey	No, an article must be suitable for syndication.
2014-03-24 07:46:18	slu9freek	hmm.. ok.
2014-03-24 07:46:22	slu9freek	also, if I just have an h1 for my articles, is it better to do header h1 /h1 /header? or just the h1?
2014-03-24 07:47:17	lilmonkey	If you have just a heading you don't need to include the <header>, but it's also fine if you do. It just doesn't add anything.
2014-03-24 07:47:51	slu9freek	i see, less is more (but more isnt less... or something like that) haha
2014-03-24 07:48:18	lilmonkey	Consistency is most important :)
2014-03-24 07:48:41	slu9freek	can header replace h1?
2014-03-24 07:48:45	lilmonkey	No
2014-03-24 07:49:14	slu9freek	bummer (sure reads nicer)
2014-03-24 07:49:39	slu9freek	Is an h# required in a header?
2014-03-24 07:51:10	lilmonkey	Essentially, yes, as a <header> act as the header for its section (<section>, <article>, <aside>, <body>, ...), and each section should always have a heading.
2014-03-24 07:51:43	lilmonkey	But it's not a hard rule, the validator probably won't complain of you don't.
2014-03-24 07:51:50	lilmonkey	Good question actually :)

2014-03-24 07:53:27	slu9freek	lilmonkey: I only ask because I think that the outliner would not have an untitled root if I have an h1 before the article, but the only thing I rly find suitable to put there is the h1 in the heading of the article. sincle there is also a p and a ul in the heading... it could work, but I'm thinking I'll just leave it in the article.
2014-03-24 07:53:43	slu9freek	I'm surprised the outliner doesnt use the title tag at all

From the generated list of checkboxes, when the form is POSTed I want the value1 and value2 sent over. I could put the values value like this: value='12_example.com'  , but there must be a better way of doing this?

2014-03-24 21:42:48	timmi_qt	 However if I specify the width and height for an iframe, and load the image inside, the image doesnt get scaled to the iframe size. how can I achieve that?

2014-03-24 23:14:32	thebope	Is there any reason I wouldn't be able to press enter in a text area? On other webpages it seems that pressing enter moves the cursor to the new line and then depending on what wrap="" is set to the carriage return is rendered accordingly. But on the website I am working on I press enter and nothing happens...

2014-03-24 23:25:32	Pilum	Showing us just the textarea is not enough to determine if you have broken markup heh. Validate it.
2014-03-24 23:25:46	Pilum	Also, don't use inline styles.
2014-03-24 23:30:58	thebope	Pilum, yea its a big website
2014-03-24 23:31:13	thebope	occasionally there's not much to do besides use some inline
2014-03-24 23:31:19	Pilum	Nonsense.
2014-03-24 23:31:29	Pilum	All the more reason to do it properly.
2014-03-24 23:31:41	Pilum	Inline is a nightmare to maintain.
2014-03-24 23:32:43	thebope	yea but we don't use inline unless it's just for one element you know?

2014-03-27 23:51:06	feudin	can i use the header tag itself as a container which will hold the <nav>, and maybe a div which contains input form, or should i wrap it all, including the header in a <div id=header-container> or something similar?<div/>

2014-03-27 23:55:57	Visage	feudin, the header element itself is fine. Div is semantically meaningless. You only use it when you have no better block-level element to use or when you need a styling hook.

2014-03-28 19:33:33	Visage	The syntax is correct, other than you using silly single quotes for everything.
2014-03-28 19:33:59	Visage	But if the script(s) won't load, then go find out why. Does the script really live at that url?
2014-03-28 19:34:50	leosw	Visage: Yes, in firefox, via Ctrl+U, I can click te url and the script opens
2014-03-28 19:35:16	leosw	Simple quotes because generated via PHP
2014-03-28 19:36:24	leosw	The answer is : adblock+
2014-03-28 19:36:25	Visage	So update your php to not do that. :)

2014-03-29 05:01:18	CoJaBo	I usually get them well after the damage is done >_>
2014-03-29 05:01:36	CoJaBo	One lost her domain entirely to blacklisting.

2014-03-29 05:03:05	CoJaBo	This wasn't even a retaliation; it's just that Google/Yahoo/etc found out about the SEO company's scheme.
2014-03-29 05:03:44	bryanbuchanan	ah yeah
2014-03-29 05:04:07	bryanbuchanan	if they’re accidentially getting things blacklisted by trying to help, I don’t want to know what they can do if they try :)
2014-03-29 05:04:12	CoJaBo	Basicly, 99% of the time "SEO" means "linkspamming"
2014-03-29 05:04:47	CoJaBo	They spam the HELL out of the customers site, get it to #1 on Google, take the money, and they're done.
2014-03-29 05:05:02	CoJaBo	A week or two later, the site gets blacklisted. No refunds.
2014-03-29 05:05:10	bryanbuchanan	I’ve noticed these trends: run the site through a validator and show the errors to the client to scare them
2014-03-29 05:05:25	CoJaBo	O yeh, I've seen those too
2014-03-29 05:05:28	bryanbuchanan	(even though the errors are likely from Facebook like buttons and things like that)

2014-03-29 05:06:23	bryanbuchanan	Then, send them a automatically generated sitemap file and template robots file
2014-03-29 05:06:43	CoJaBo	The co I work for now got one of those "web-vulnerability scanners" free as part of their previous hosting plan
2014-03-29 05:06:51	bryanbuchanan	Then, when that does nothing, try to sell them on a wordpress site, because that’s the only thing they know how to do.
2014-03-29 05:07:09	CoJaBo	Its hilarious how fake those scanner things are, egads
2014-03-29 05:07:42	bryanbuchanan	I’ve also seen a SEO place simply sign up for a Google Places for Business in the name of the company
2014-03-29 05:08:02	CoJaBo	One of their sites, unfortunately, was done by outsourcers and had more holes than swiss cheese; the scanner gave it a clean bill of health.
2014-03-29 05:08:02	bryanbuchanan	and charge $400/mo to do that
2014-03-29 05:08:23	CoJaBo	I checked the logs, and the scanner wasn't actually scanning the site at all for anything
2014-03-29 05:08:31	bryanbuchanan	The fac tthat the client is searching for their business likely FROM THEIR BUSINESS ADDRESS< they show up first.
2014-03-29 05:08:41	bryanbuchanan	haha that’s hilarious
2014-03-29 05:09:57	CoJaBo	I get a lot of the ones who say thay your Google subscription is up
2014-03-29 05:10:33	CoJaBo	Your free trial listing is up, and you have to pay $300/year or so to remain on Google, or they'll remove you.
2014-03-29 05:11:03	bryanbuchanan	such shit heads haha
2014-03-29 05:11:53	CoJaBo	People really fall for them too :/
2014-03-29 05:12:20	CoJaBo	I know a ton of people who've fallen for the CyberDefender scam; that's one of the biggest right now
2014-03-29 05:12:31	bryanbuchanan	I’ve repeatedly told my clients that SEO is completely overhyped and a scam, and half of them go buy SEO services anyway haha

2014-03-31 00:12:12	Sagiftw	the same url
2014-03-31 00:12:20	lilmonkey	And?
2014-03-31 00:12:45	Sagiftw	and using ssi i can't do that
2014-03-31 00:12:52	lilmonkey	You're not making any sense.
2014-03-31 00:13:25	lilmonkey	Whatever common elements you want to include on your pages, you do it on the server.
2014-03-31 00:14:24	Sagiftw	ok. i understand that but let's say i want to show a little google mini-web page (call it include, frame idc) inside my page
2014-03-31 00:14:55	Visage	What's a "google mini-web page?"
2014-03-31 00:15:01	Sagiftw	and then i want to press on a link on the menu and move to another html page and retain the same mini-web element the way it was
2014-03-31 00:15:08	Visage	Google doesn't like to be iframed anyway, because they have proper APIs.
2014-03-31 00:15:28	Sagiftw	for instance a small iframe window showing the google website
2014-03-31 00:15:42	Sagiftw	google is only an example in this issue… i use other sites
2014-03-31 00:16:23	Visage	Right, well, an iframe is almost never the solution.

2014-03-31 18:09:49	el-aurian	hi there
2014-03-31 18:10:10	el-aurian	i'm currently designing an FAQ system, which expands from our helpdesk service
2014-03-31 18:11:06	el-aurian	since the helpdesk is pretty unintuitive, I have to either be very simplistic, or complicated to the point of designing my own module to plug into the webserver, and so I'm like suggestions on how to achieve somethig
2014-03-31 18:11:07	el-aurian	something*
2014-03-31 18:11:32	el-aurian	I would like to avoid databases as much as possible, so I'd be interested in alternatives
2014-03-31 18:12:04	el-aurian	basically, I have a number of HTML tables, with low-level information in them, relating to different aspects of our system
2014-03-31 18:12:29	-->	otisZart (~textual@host84-112-dynamic.247-95-r.retail.telecomitalia.it) has joined #html
2014-03-31 18:12:50	el-aurian	I would like to achieve a design, whereby single rows of are extracted from the tables and inserted into FAQs
2014-03-31 18:13:29	oksushi	el-aurian: doesn’t really sound like a question about HTML. Try asking the guys in #web
2014-03-31 18:14:56	el-aurian	an example of what I'm looking for is <p>Log onto server <embed type="text/table" parameter={axis:server_designation:PDC}>
2014-03-31 18:15:10	el-aurian	oksushi: I will look at server technologies if necessary
2014-03-31 18:16:08	el-aurian	but I was hoping a facility related to, but outside of, the html standard (such as client side includes) would provide the functionality I'm looking for
2014-03-31 18:16:43	el-aurian	the reason I'm asking here, is because my idea revolves heavily around the axis or header attributes for selecting the information
2014-03-31 18:17:15	lilmonkey	lol, you wrote all of that mumbo jumbo when all you meant to ask was "client-side includes"?
2014-03-31 18:18:03	el-aurian	lilmonkey: client-side includes isn't specific, the include needs to be capable of enterpretting a html table
2014-03-31 18:18:12	lilmonkey	interpreting*
2014-03-31 18:18:12	el-aurian	intepretting*
2014-03-31 18:18:18	oksushi	haha
2014-03-31 18:18:46	lilmonkey	and there is no such thing as client-side includes in the first place, let alone as ridiculously specific as what you need
2014-03-31 18:19:46	el-aurian	I agree it's specific, but it's not ridiculous, the HTML 4 table standard aludes to this exact purpose in it's definition of the axis attribute
2014-03-31 18:19:54	lilmonkey	its*
2014-03-31 18:20:40	el-aurian	"This attribute may be used to place a cell into conceptual categories that can be considered to form axes in an n-dimensional space. User agents may give users access to these categories (e.g., the user may query the user agent for all cells that belong to certain categories, the user agent may present a table in the form of a table of contents, etc.). "
2014-03-31 18:20:56	lilmonkey	Yes, specs allude to many things, but it doesn't change what I said
2014-03-31 18:21:46	lilmonkey	el-aurian: you should stop referencing an outdated spec, though
2014-03-31 18:22:05	el-aurian	I'm referencing that spec, because it contains a feature I want
2014-03-31 18:22:13	lilmonkey	...
2014-03-31 18:22:14	el-aurian	HTML 5 doesn't.
2014-03-31 18:22:18	lilmonkey	Are you stupid?
2014-03-31 18:22:35	lilmonkey	Would you reference HTML1 if it contained a feature you were interested in?
2014-03-31 18:22:56	el-aurian	such as marquee?
2014-03-31 18:23:02	lilmonkey	Also, it doesn't contain this feature, it just, as you said, alludes to the functionality.
2014-03-31 18:23:48	el-aurian	but it defines the attribute that facilitates the features implementation
2014-03-31 18:24:03	el-aurian	this is a needless debate
2014-03-31 18:24:10	lilmonkey	Your point is unclear.
2014-03-31 18:24:11	el-aurian	my question was simply, can it be done
2014-03-31 18:24:16	lilmonkey	HTML4 is outdated.
2014-03-31 18:24:29	lilmonkey	I already answered that question a long time ago.
2014-03-31 18:24:48	el-aurian	it's just difficult to find it in-amongst the proceeding rant
2014-03-31 18:24:58	lilmonkey	It was before the rant.
2014-03-31 18:25:29	lilmonkey	And you even referenced something I said in my answer, so you DID read it.

2014-03-31 20:39:48	CrowX-	hmm

2014-03-31 23:27:15	lilmonkey	cr3: but... reading your original question a little while ago, you might just be having a CSS issue: are you sure your element is able to have a width and height? Its display must be one of block, inline-block, table, and a few others.
2014-03-31 23:27:22	lilmonkey	cr3: more in #css if needed
2014-03-31 23:27:47	lilmonkey	Of course, divs are block-level by default, but you might be overriding it accidentally (or intentionally ;)

2014-04-02 06:02:09	jphase	well, it will only show the filename, but if you attached a javascript/jquery event to the element on change for example, the value of that input after a file is attached is preceded with C:\fakepath\ despite it only displaying the filename
2014-04-02 06:02:56	Pilum	File inputs are restricted so that makes sense. ##javascript for more on that.

2014-04-03 00:12:43	MindIsAVortex	hi there, I'm a student, new to a lot of this. Today I got into a discussion with someone over what the head tag should contain. In my experience this contains references to things like stylesheets,  js files, and the title. The other guy was basically talking about putting the top navigation bar in there. Am I wrong?

2014-04-03 00:14:59	Visage	MindIsAVortex, You're correct, but you two might've just miscommunicated.
2014-04-03 00:15:22	Visage	You're referring to the HEAD element, whereas your friend was talking about the HEADER element.
2014-04-03 00:15:47	MindIsAVortex	ah
2014-04-03 00:16:13	MindIsAVortex	Isn't header just h1/h2/h3?
2014-04-03 00:16:33	Visage	No, hX are heading elements, something else entirely again. :)

2014-04-03 00:17:21	Visage	Well, h# elements and the HEAD element have all existed for a very long time now. The only new one is HEADER, which was introduced in HTML5.
2014-04-03 00:18:01	MindIsAVortex	right, I found the w3c article now. Makes sense. We were just talking about different things

2014-04-03 05:53:10	mortal1	e.value does not return the value attribute of e
2014-04-03 05:57:17	mortal1	well that's strange
2014-04-03 05:57:35	mortal1	in my code, my input is closed />, but not in the chrome console
2014-04-03 05:58:21	mortal1	ok, whatever, it's closed in the viewSrc
2014-04-03 05:58:29	mortal1	I dunno what chrome is on about

2014-04-03 05:59:56	mortal1	so, that would have an effect on what .value would return?

2014-04-03 06:06:09	mortal1	so have you ever seen html behave this way?
2014-04-03 06:07:02	mortal1	return something for it's .value that it clearly isn't
2014-04-03 06:07:14	lilmonkey	In short... the DOM doesn't have a syntax, it's not something that is written. The DOM is an internal represenatation of an HTML, XHTML, SVG, etc document.
2014-04-03 06:07:44	mortal1	an 'in memory' datastructure
2014-04-03 06:07:44	lilmonkey	What you see in any browser's dev tools' code view is just one possible visualisation of the doument's DOM.
2014-04-03 06:07:57	mortal1	k
2014-04-03 06:08:29	lilmonkey	Furthermore, 99.9% of all supposed 'XHTML' is actually (incorrectly) served as HTML.
2014-04-03 06:08:41	 *	mortal1 nods
2014-04-03 06:09:29	lilmonkey	Most likely you are too, so from that POV there's no reason to expect to see /> either, as in HTML, you don't need to explicitly close empty element -- in fact, pre-HTML5, that wasn't even possible.
2014-04-03 06:09:40	mortal1	ok, got it
2014-04-03 06:10:10	mortal1	do you feel this pertains to my original question, of why e's value and e.value are different?
2014-04-03 06:10:17	lilmonkey	No
2014-04-03 06:10:20	mortal1	or was this just an aside
2014-04-03 06:10:21	mortal1	ah
2014-04-03 06:10:40	lilmonkey	Any your code snippet is useless for getting help with, as you might understand
2014-04-03 06:10:52	mortal1	how so?
2014-04-03 06:10:59	lilmonkey	What am I supposed to do with it?
2014-04-03 06:11:05	lilmonkey	Let my dog sniff it?
2014-04-03 06:11:39	mortal1	i'm sorry do you read what you write before you send it?

2014-04-03 06:14:02	mortal1	Ok, I have several zip code inputs on this page
2014-04-03 06:14:12	lilmonkey	The result you're seeing is the sum of everything you feed the browser, and what the browser does with it.
2014-04-03 06:14:21	mortal1	the third one has this behavior but not the other two
2014-04-03 06:14:21	lilmonkey	If you want help, I need to see the same thing.
2014-04-03 06:14:43	lilmonkey	IOW, provide a link to a WORKING test case that shows the problem.
