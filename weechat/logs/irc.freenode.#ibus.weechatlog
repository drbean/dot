2013-12-03 16:37:21	bochecha	dueno: yeah, we haven't made a new release yet
2013-12-03 16:37:35	bochecha	we're very close, though
2013-12-03 16:37:44	bochecha	but there's a little bit of work needed on ibus-cangjie, still
2013-12-03 16:37:56	bochecha	and I can't really upgrade one without the other :)
2013-12-03 16:38:21	bochecha	but as soon as I've released it, I'll put it in an update for Fedora >= 19

2013-12-04 12:18:05	dueno	bochecha, for a demo of my experimental IM framework
2013-12-04 12:18:16	bochecha	oh
2013-12-04 12:18:47	bochecha	is that something you plan to replace ibus with?
2013-12-04 12:19:15	dueno	not sure at the moment
2013-12-04 12:19:41	OMGOMG	oh hey, chats
2013-12-04 12:19:59	OMGOMG	anyone know of a reasonably simple way to use chinese characters in latex?
2013-12-04 12:20:41	bochecha	dueno: if you want an engine in python rather than C, have a look at pycangjie ;)
2013-12-04 12:21:26	bochecha	dueno: also, as I mentioned in your bug report, we're gping to bump the version of libcangjie just before the release, so that would remove the confusion for you
2013-12-04 12:21:37	bochecha	dueno: in the meantime, how can I make it easier for you?
2013-12-04 12:23:27	dueno	bochecha, thanks - that's fine with me
2013-12-04 12:23:51	bochecha	the release will be 1.0, if you want to bump it locally ;)
2013-12-04 12:24:23	dueno	okay

2013-12-09 18:59:45	bochecha	where is that discussion happening? :)

2013-12-13 16:10:45	fujiwarat	I have the plan to release ibus 1.5.5 in this month.
2013-12-13 16:20:15	bochecha	fujiwarat: anything to look forward to for engine authors? (deprecations, compatibility breaking changes,...)
2013-12-13 16:23:41	fujiwarat	bochecha: Probably no news for engine authors. It's almost a bug fix release.
2013-12-13 16:23:51	bochecha	cool :)
2013-12-13 16:23:56	fujiwarat	:)

2014-01-06 16:29:40	anish_	rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-06 16:29:40	bochecha	anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-06 16:29:40	bochecha	and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-06 16:29:40	rtcm	anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-06 16:29:41	rtcm	bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-06 16:30:39	bochecha	rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-06 16:31:20	bochecha	a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-06 16:31:20	bochecha	and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-06 16:34:26	bochecha	rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-06 16:34:26	rtcm	bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-06 16:34:39	anish_	bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-06 16:34:41	bochecha	rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-06 16:35:24	bochecha	so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-06 16:35:24	bochecha	anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-06 16:35:24	rtcm	there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-06 16:35:24	bochecha	rtcm: oh?
2014-01-06 16:35:39	rtcm	what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-06 16:36:22	bochecha	ah, so "zh"
2014-01-06 16:36:22	rtcm	and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-06 16:36:22	rtcm	ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-06 16:36:22	bochecha	I see
2014-01-06 16:36:22	bochecha	is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-06 16:36:22	 *	rtcm still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-06 16:36:39	rtcm	just g-c-c
2014-01-06 16:37:22	rtcm	hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-06 16:37:22	rtcm	so also ibus yeah
2014-01-06 16:37:22	bochecha	:(
2014-01-06 16:38:07	rtcm	I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-06 16:38:07	rtcm	ungly but that should work
2014-01-06 16:38:07	rtcm	you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-06 16:38:39	bochecha	but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-06 16:38:39	rtcm	depending on HK or TW
2014-01-06 16:38:39	rtcm	I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-06 16:38:39	bochecha	yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-06 16:38:54	bochecha	yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-06 16:41:40	bochecha	my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-06 16:41:40	bochecha	but that didn't work :)
2014-01-06 16:42:14	bochecha	would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-06 16:42:14	bochecha	(and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-06 16:42:14	rtcm	perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change

2014-01-07 05:41:21	mcc	Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-07 05:41:51	mcc	It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-07 05:42:21	mcc	I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-07 05:50:54	rtcm	mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-07 05:51:14	rtcm	otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-07 05:56:42	mcc	the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-07 05:57:23	mcc	are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-07 05:57:27	mcc	like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-07 06:23:24	rtcm	mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-07 06:23:37	rtcm	not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-07 06:35:53	mcc	Thank you very much

2014-01-15 06:24:37	CalimeroTeknik	I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-15 06:24:50	CalimeroTeknik	so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-15 06:25:31	CalimeroTeknik	the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-15 06:26:22	CalimeroTeknik	it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-15 06:27:26	CalimeroTeknik	I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-16 18:18:43	rtcm_	I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-16 18:18:54	rtcm_	s/soft/sort/
2014-01-16 18:21:00	bochecha	ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-16 18:21:17	rtcm_	that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-16 18:22:24	bochecha	:D
2014-01-16 18:22:35	bochecha	speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-16 18:23:59	rtcm_	I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-16 18:24:19	rtcm_	still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-16 18:32:51	bochecha	heh
2014-01-16 18:33:01	bochecha	I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-17 10:23:19	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-17 10:23:19	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-17 10:23:19	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-17 10:23:19	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-17 10:23:19	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-17 10:23:19	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-17 10:23:19	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-17 10:23:19	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-17 10:23:19	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-17 10:23:19	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-17 10:23:19	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-17 10:23:19	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-17 10:23:19	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-17 10:23:19	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-22 21:50:31	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-22 21:50:31	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-22 21:50:31	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-22 21:50:31	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-22 21:50:31	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-22 21:50:31	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-22 21:50:31	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-22 21:50:31	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-22 21:50:31	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-22 21:50:31	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-22 21:50:31	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-22 21:50:31	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-26 10:12:47	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-26 10:12:47	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-26 10:12:47	fujiwarat	[18:09:33] rtcm_: hi, do you have any comments on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721006 ?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-26 10:12:47	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-26 10:12:47	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-26 10:12:47	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-26 10:12:47	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-01-26 10:12:47	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-01-26 10:12:47	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-01-27 20:13:59	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-27 20:13:59	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-27 20:13:59	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-27 20:13:59	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-27 20:13:59	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-27 20:13:59	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-27 20:13:59	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-27 20:13:59	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-27 20:13:59	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-27 20:13:59	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-27 20:13:59	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-01-27 20:13:59	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-01-27 20:13:59	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-01-28 09:22:45	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-28 09:22:45	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-28 09:22:45	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-28 09:22:45	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-28 09:22:45	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-28 09:22:45	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-28 09:22:45	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-28 09:22:45	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.

2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't

2014-01-28 09:22:45	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-28 09:22:45	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-28 09:22:45	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-28 09:22:45	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-28 09:22:45	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-28 09:22:45	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-28 09:22:45	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-28 09:22:45	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.

2014-01-28 09:22:45	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-01-28 12:39:04	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-28 12:39:04	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-28 12:39:04	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-28 12:39:04	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-28 12:39:04	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-28 12:39:04	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-28 12:39:04	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-28 12:39:04	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-28 12:39:04	fujiwarat	[18:09:33] rtcm_: hi, do you have any comments on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721006 ?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-28 12:39:04	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-28 12:39:04	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-28 12:39:04	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-28 12:39:04	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-01-28 12:39:04	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-01-28 12:39:04	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-01-28 20:56:58	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-28 20:56:58	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-28 20:56:58	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-28 20:56:58	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-28 20:56:58	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-28 20:56:58	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-28 20:56:58	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-28 20:56:58	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-28 20:56:58	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-28 20:56:58	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-28 20:56:58	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)

2014-01-28 20:56:58	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh

2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-28 20:56:58	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-28 20:56:58	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-01-28 20:56:58	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-01-28 20:56:58	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-01-31 16:50:30	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-01-31 16:50:30	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-01-31 16:50:30	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-01-31 16:50:30	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-01-31 16:50:30	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)

2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-01-31 16:50:30	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-01-31 16:50:30	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-01-31 16:50:30	fujiwarat	[18:09:33] rtcm_: hi, do you have any comments on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721006 ?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-01-31 16:50:30	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-01-31 16:50:30	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-01-31 16:50:30	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-01-31 16:50:30	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-01-31 16:50:30	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-01-31 16:50:30	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-02-02 19:21:21	triplc	Hi all
2014-02-02 19:22:28	triplc	Is there a way to 'blacklist' some applications? Example, set openbox (window manager) to be black listed
2014-02-02 19:23:15	bochecha	triplc, what would be the effect of such a blacklist?
2014-02-02 19:24:10	triplc	i mean, ibus just do not provide IM for that application
2014-02-02 19:24:55	triplc	you know, once ibus IM is on, it will have effect on all applications
2014-02-02 19:25:16	triplc	so, is there a way to black-list some

2014-02-05 19:45:54	thedoctar	[18:15:16] how do you change the default preedit window position for sunpinyin with ibus. I'm using lubuntu 13.10. The problem is it currently displays at the bottom left-hand corner of the window and when the window is maximised, the window is off-screen.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	contyk	[18:30:05] hi devs, I wonder if you could point me to a solution; I recently switched to IBus from SCIM and find the compose window border too big -- when I type in xterm, the character being composed appears as if in the next column; is there a way to configure this?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	contyk	[18:30:46] (it's probably more of a GTK thing, I know)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	shadowbroker	[08:56:19] hello. i'm trying to get pinyin input working with kubuntu 13.10, but i cant get it activated
2014-02-05 19:45:54	shadowbroker	[08:56:34] i've added the chinese keyboard layout to my keyboard layouts and assigned a shortcut
2014-02-05 19:45:54	shadowbroker	[08:56:44] but it just stays on English layout no matter what i do
2014-02-05 19:45:54	shadowbroker	[08:57:08] i've read some posts online that say iBus is broken in 13.10? but all of the posts were pre iBus 1.5
2014-02-05 19:45:54	Guest23062	[20:02:55] rtcm, hi, happy new year, and a quick ibus/g-c-c question for you when you have a moment :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[20:30:08] rtcm, that was from me (troubles with my nickname today)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[00:49:25] Hi friends, please have a look at this issue report: https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1684
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:29:39] bochecha: hey, happy new year!
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:29:39] rtcm: oh hi, thanks, and happy new year to you too :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	anish_	[16:29:40] rtcm, bochecha Hey, Happy new year !!!
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:29:40] anish_: thanks, same to you
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:29:40] and to the rest of the channel :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:29:40] anish_: you too :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:29:41] bochecha: what's the question?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:30:39] rtcm: so, in G-C-C, ibus-cangjie appears under "Chinese (Hong Kong)"
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:31:20] a user reported that Cangjie is also widely used in Taiwan (although not as much as in HK) so it would make sense to have it **also** listed under "Chinese (Taiwan)"
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:31:20] and I have no idea how to do that, where G-C-C picks up the information,... :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:34:26] rtcm: actually I do have an idea: is that picked up from the <language> tag in the XML component file?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:34:26] bochecha: yes, it's from that tag
2014-02-05 19:45:54	anish_	[16:34:39] bochecha, check out engine.py --xml as well 
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:34:41] rtcm: ok, thanks
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:35:24] so I guess my question now becomes a more general question about ibus xml files, and how to support multiple languages
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:35:24] anish_: where is that file?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:35:24] there's no way to make it appear in just 2 places though
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:35:24] rtcm: oh?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:35:39] what you can do atm, is just specify the language without the country
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:36:22] ah, so "zh"
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:36:22] and then it should appear under all locales for that language, i.e. all the 3 cn_** locales
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:36:22] ah yes, zh, sorry
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:36:22] I see
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:36:22] is that a limitation in ibus or in g-c-c?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	 *	rtcm [16:36:22] still _slowly_ getting back online
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:36:39] just g-c-c
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:37:22] hmm, actually I don't think the ibus api gives us more than one locale string though
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:37:22] so also ibus yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:37:22] :(
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:38:07] I gues you could install 2 XML files
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:38:07] ungly but that should work
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:38:07] you could even have slightly different defaults that way
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:38:39] but then they need to have a different <name> as well
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:38:39] depending on HK or TW
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:38:39] I gues tthe user visible description can be the same
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:38:39] yeah, we might want to go that road one day, but for now I'd rather avoid it if possible ;)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:38:54] yes, the <longname> can be the same
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:41:40] my initial reaction was to just try setting the language to zh_HK,zh_TW
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:41:40] but that didn't work :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:42:14] would that be an acceptable change in ibus?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[16:42:14] (and that's not just addressed to you rtcm, but to the channel in general :) )
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[16:42:14] perhaps, if it's acceptable for ibus, then g-c-c is easy to change
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:40:44] Hello... I am working on a program that does not use a conventional widget toolkit. I would like for it to be able to take input from ibus.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:41:21] Currently, if I give my program's window focus and I select chinese input from the keyboard menu thing (I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) I do not get the little chinese-language popup widget I normally get, and input continues to be English.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:41:51] It seems like there is something I need to do in order to make ibus aware that my program is an input field. Where should I start if I am interested as a developer in adding ibus support to a program?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:42:21] I'm finding user documentation for ibus but nothing that looks like developer documentation.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[05:50:54] mcc: check how the gtk+ or qt modules work
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[05:51:14] otherwise you can implemente XIM support in your toolkit but really don't
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:56:42] the qt module does something different from implementing "XIM" directly?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:57:23] are the gtk+ and qt "modules" something that exists as part of qt, or something that exists as part of ibus?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[05:57:27] like, whose project will host that code?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[06:23:24] mcc: the gtk module is in https://github.com/ibus/ibus/tree/master/client/gtk2
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm	[06:23:37] not sure where the qt module is maintained 
2014-02-05 19:45:54	mcc	[06:35:53] Thank you very much

2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:22:59] hello
2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:37] I'm having trouble with ibus 1.5 (keeping 1.4 for now) : it's predating the system keymap
2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:24:50] so I have a qwerty layout to type romaji for japanese input
2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:25:31] the XKB method becomes a basic qwerty, apparently
2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:26:22] it also crashes openbox, but well.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	CalimeroTeknik	[06:27:26] I need to run setxkbmap fr when I switch to Japanese input

2014-02-05 19:45:54	fujiwarat	[18:09:33] rtcm_: hi, do you have any comments on https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721006 ?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:13:54] fujoh yes, please
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:14:05] oops, gone
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:14:17] yeah, just when I was goign to reply :-/
2014-02-05 19:45:54	 *	bochecha [18:14:36] can't count th enumber of people who chose "Chinese" expecting they would be able to type CHinese with it, and then complaing it doesn't work when all they get is English
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:17:12] rtcm_: out of curiosity, what would have been the reply? :)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:17:25] yeah, that sucks
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:18:01] the reply would be that yes we need something like this, but I'm not sure this is the best place to do it
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:18:15] must think about it a bit more
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:18:43] I also want to make user installable xkb layouts possible for wayland which soft of ties in with this stuff
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:18:54] s/soft/sort/
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:21:00] ah, so less xkb layouts would be installed by default (e.g not Chinese), so there wouldn't be a need for a blacklist?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:21:17] that would be great wouldn't it? :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:22:24] :D
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:22:35] speaking about wayland, how's ibus going on that front?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:23:59] I'm not sure tbh
2014-02-05 19:45:54	rtcm_	[18:24:19] still fighting mutter-wayland and xkb layouts
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:32:51] heh
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[18:33:01] I'll go back to fighting with perl and let you to it then :)

2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[14:55:45] Hi, I notice that the github bot on your channel's name is 'github' exactly and not a randomly generated name like GitHub78. I just checked and found out that the nick 'github' has already been registered. Then how can you guys use that nick?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[14:56:38] lewtds: they probably didn't register it, it might be a bot provided by github people?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[14:57:52] bochecha: the official name for a GitHub bot is a random name: https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb#L55
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[14:58:03] unless you specify a different nick
2014-02-05 19:45:54	fujiwarat	[15:17:46] lewtds: The ower of github bot has not been online...
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[15:24:16] fujiwarat: Yeah, I've just checked and it seems he's not from GitHub. Did you guys ask him for the password?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	fujiwarat	[15:24:50] lewtds: no :).
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[15:25:15] hmmm, that's strange
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[15:26:01] could it be possible that the GitHub bot joins freenode for less than 30 seconds and as such doesn't need the password?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	fujiwarat	[15:28:32] I don't touch the github bot.
2014-02-05 19:45:54	lewtds	[15:29:05] thanks, anw :D
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[21:28:03] so, the component xml for engines contains strings that eventually become user visible (like the description), are they translatable? if so, how?

2014-02-05 19:45:54	triplc	[19:21:21] Hi all
2014-02-05 19:45:54	triplc	[19:22:28] Is there a way to 'blacklist' some applications? Example, set openbox (window manager) to be black listed
2014-02-05 19:45:54	bochecha	[19:23:15] triplc, what would be the effect of such a blacklist?
2014-02-05 19:45:54	triplc	[19:24:10] i mean, ibus just do not provide IM for that application
2014-02-05 19:45:54	triplc	[19:24:55] you know, once ibus IM is on, it will have effect on all applications
2014-02-05 19:45:54	triplc	[19:25:16] so, is there a way to black-list some

2014-02-15 21:06:12	FTC56	Hello
2014-02-15 21:08:37	FTC56	I have a quick question about Ibus. I want to use Anthy Ibus to write in Japanese. The problem is that since I am French, my keyboard is QWERTY. Off when I use Anthy, it passes in QWERTY and is not necessarily easy to type (lack of practice).
2014-02-15 21:09:03	FTC56	I want to know if there was a method to solve this problem?

2014-02-19 10:46:39	github	[14:08:03] ibus/master 5c25f8c fujiwarat: Fix deprecated GtkStock in ibus-setup...
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:00:48] I recently had a pull request accepted on https://github.com/kaio/ibus-table but I'm noticing that other sources seem to consider https://github.com/acevery/ibus-table to be the upstream. Should I submit the pull request at acevery's repo?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:01:36] Leftmost: afaik, acevery's repo is pretty much abandonned, and kaio took over maintainance a year or two ago
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:02:15] Ahh, okay. Thank you. Should references to acevery's repo then be changed to point to kaio's? (Ohloh, the Google Code page, etc.)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:02:19] I know mfabian has contributed quite a lot to kaio's repo since then (and kaio himself, of course)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:03:52] I am trying to make an update for Fedora 21 from Kaio’s 1.7 branch.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:05:45] Hmm. I'm interested in seeing the change from my PR and another I'm going to file against ibus-table-others included in F21, though I don't know how practical that is.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:06:17] (It allows ibus-table entries to set the symbol property for the IM, making table-based methods friendlier in GNOME 3.)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:06:50] Leftmost: is your pull request already in the 1.7 branch?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:07:03] Leftmost: ha! I had a patch for that a year or so ago, that I never submitted, and then forgot about
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:07:08] Leftmost: thank you for doing this :)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:08:35] As far as I know, it's only hit master, but I believe it's the only change in master which isn't in 1.7.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:10:39] bochecha, always happy to make things a little better. :)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:21:06] Leftmost: I’ll try to pick that patch as well then when I try to finish the update. I tried last a week ago but there was a lot of brokenness in the 1.7 branch which I could not fix quickly.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:21:13] And then I ran out of time.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:21:45] Thanks.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:22:04] Hopefully I can get the ibus-table-others patch in as well, though it will only touch IPA-X-SAMPA.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:22:26] Leftmost: You made a pull request for ibus-table-others?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:22:49] Not yet. I'll do that in the next couple hours.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:22:53] OK.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:43:14] mfabian: by the way, I'm thinking of asking to drop ibus-table-chinese-{cangjie,quick} in F21, now that ibus-cangjie is getting pretty good
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[15:43:39] mfabian: do you think that's appropriate? would that be only for the Fedora package, or also upstream?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	 *	bochecha [15:43:46] is entirely unsure :)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:43:53] I don’t know either.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[15:51:32] moebiuscurve's ibus-table-others repo is the upstream, right?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[15:54:27] Leftmost: Yes, that’s upstream, as far as I know. 
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[16:00:07] and ibus-table-chinese upstream is at definite/ibus-table-chinese iirc (which is dingyichen's repo)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[16:00:19] (in case you were wondering about other tables)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[16:05:48] Alright, made a pull request for ibus-table-others.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[16:06:33] I've wondered before if it would make sense to try to implement the IPA-X-SAMPA IM as something other than a table-based IM, but I don't know enough about ibus to really be sure.

2014-02-19 10:46:39	github	[17:01:43] ibus/master d5319e4 fujiwarat: Update translations....
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[17:59:12] Leftmost: did you try whether your patch works?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[17:59:47] Only for IPA-X-SAMPA, and that not recently.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:00:02] I can build it and try now if you need me to.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[18:00:06] Leftmost: It requires your ibus-table patch?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:00:09] Yes.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[18:00:28] Ah, OK, that’s why it didn’t work for me.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:00:57] Yeah, ibus-table doesn't recognize the SYMBOL directive without the patch.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:14:19] Thanks mfabian.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:14:26] Insert a comma somewhere in there.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[18:14:40] Leftmost: A comma?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[18:14:44] Where?
2014-02-19 10:46:39	bochecha	[18:15:04] between "thanks" and "mfabian" ? :)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:15:08] Yes. :)
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[18:15:29] I thought something was wrong with merging your pull request.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[18:15:37] Heh, no. Sorry.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[05:52:25] Leftmost: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ibus-table-1.5.0.20140218-1.fc20  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ibus-table-1.5.0.20140218-1.fc19
2014-02-19 10:46:39	mfabian	[05:53:29] Leftmost: This update contains your patch “Allow tables to specify a symbol for display”
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[05:55:45] Grabbing and installing.
2014-02-19 10:46:39	Leftmost	[05:59:02] Built ipa-x-sampa.db and it looks like it's working.

2014-02-20 14:10:13	Leftmost	Cool, thank you. Grabbing and installing.
2014-02-20 14:20:19	Leftmost	mfabian, I can confirm that IPA-X-SAMPA is working correctly. Thanks for your help.
2014-02-20 14:20:59	mfabian	The symbols work? I made it correctly use the updated ibus-table for build?
2014-02-20 14:21:29	Leftmost	Yep.
2014-02-20 14:22:34	mfabian	Good, it was the first time I used https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi/BuildRootOverrides

2014-02-20 14:26:16	 *	Leftmost always feel proud when his changes show up in distros.
2014-02-20 14:26:20	bochecha	mfabian: in general, if you need help with bodhi (like for the buildroot overrides), don't hesitate to ask (I know it "a bit" ;) )

2014-02-24 14:11:40	Lord-Ragnarock	Well, I've been trying to make it in Ubuntu to where I can press Caps Lock to change layouts,
2014-02-24 14:12:50	Lord-Ragnarock	So I disabled Caps Lock's functionality, which made it a null-key I couldn't assign. So I did some xmodmap magic to remap it as F13, and then mapping switching layouts to F13.
2014-02-24 14:13:56	Lord-Ragnarock	Well, now it seems every time I switch layouts, the CapsLock remap just resets back to its original null-state, and I have to type in "xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = F13' " all over again to get anything to work :(

2014-02-24 14:21:33	Lord-Ragnarock	Hm. Does look like since I changed Anthy to use the en keymap, I can actually get it to do what I wanted it to.
2014-02-24 14:23:32	Lord-Ragnarock	Only little thing being that the Caps LED blinks on and off as I change layouts, but it doesn't affect typing at all. Would be nice to at least be able to get rid of the entire Caps functionality in the process, though, if y'all know how to do that :)
2014-02-24 14:23:39	fujiwarat	Lord-Ragnarock: If you use non-GNOME desktop, Enabled "Use system keyboard layout" will keep your custom layout.
2014-02-24 14:23:51	fujiwarat	on ibus-setup command.
2014-02-24 14:24:12	Lord-Ragnarock	I'm using Unity if that says anything. I think that technically is GNOME.
2014-02-24 14:26:25	fujiwarat	Mostly impossible in GNOME. which ibus engines do you use?
2014-02-24 14:27:34	Lord-Ragnarock	Define Engines? Stuff like Anthy? o.o
2014-02-24 14:27:49	fujiwarat	Do you use anthy only?
2014-02-24 14:28:35	Lord-Ragnarock	Eh, I use Anthy and Hangul, but manage to put he (phonetic) and ru (phonetic) into the mix as well.
2014-02-24 14:29:54	fujiwarat	If you use anthy, hangul only, <layout> tag in /usr/share/ibus/component/hangul.xml could be modified by manual likes anthy.xml.
2014-02-24 14:30:12	Lord-Ragnarock	(This is the ibus packaged with Ubuntu 13.10,of which I'm using the Japanese
2014-02-24 14:30:23	Lord-Ragnarock	language edition)
2014-02-24 14:30:52	fujiwarat	Ah, anthy.xml also needs to be modified by manual:
2014-02-24 14:31:04	fujiwarat	<layout>default<layout>
2014-02-24 14:32:21	-->	contempt (contempt@unaffiliated/contempt) has joined #ibus
2014-02-24 14:33:29	Lord-Ragnarock	I don't see a <layout> tag in anthy.xml. I gues I can add it somewhere? :)
2014-02-24 14:36:27	fujiwarat	For anthy, /usr/libexec/ibus-setup-anthy command -> "Typing Method" -> "Keyboard layout" -> "Default".
2014-02-24 14:39:42	Lord-Ragnarock	Hm. Didn't find the program you mentioned, but I did find the settings required to perform said task, at least :)
2014-02-24 14:39:59	fujiwarat	ok
2014-02-24 14:40:11	fujiwarat	maybe /usr/lib*/*/ibus-setup-anthy
2014-02-24 14:40:27	Lord-Ragnarock	So I've got that done, and I changed around the hangul.xml file changed to do default.
2014-02-24 14:40:43	fujiwarat	ok
2014-02-24 14:41:06	fujiwarat	The 'default' means do not change the XKB layout.
2014-02-24 14:41:16	Lord-Ragnarock	Ahh, kinda thought so :D
2014-02-24 14:42:01	fujiwarat	But if you use another ibus xkb engine, the engine will assign its layout.
2014-02-24 14:42:20	fujiwarat	You need to restart ibus to reflect your change.
2014-02-24 14:42:36	Lord-Ragnarock	Oh yeah, forgot about that...
2014-02-24 14:42:47	bochecha	Lord-Ragnarock: note that /usr/share/ibus/component/* files will be overwritten next time your package manager (e.g apt-get) updates the package delivering the file
2014-02-24 14:43:03	bochecha	so modifying them manually is generally not the best thing to do
2014-02-24 14:43:10	Lord-Ragnarock	Noted, Bochecha :)
2014-02-24 14:46:02	Lord-Ragnarock	やった!　：D
2014-02-24 14:46:33	Lord-Ragnarock	Thanks, Fuji and Boche.
2014-02-24 14:47:24	Lord-Ragnarock	Anyway, I need to sleep. Goodbye!

2014-03-03 12:33:50	Konomi	hi ibus was working fine for me on debian testing up to a point it still works fine except for one exception the "next input method" keyboard shortcut doesn't work at all switching with the mouse is fine as is everything else but the shortcut just doesn't seem to work anymore no matter what I configure it to be, any ideas?
2014-03-03 12:41:27	bochecha	Konomi: there were changes on this around 1.5 I think
2014-03-03 12:41:41	bochecha	did you try lookin gin ibus-setup, or in the preferences of your desktop?
2014-03-03 12:41:41	Konomi	I'm on 1.5.5 atm
2014-03-03 12:42:04	Konomi	yes the littion icon I know as ibus-setup is in my system tray
2014-03-03 12:42:14	Konomi	everything works bar the input shorcut for the keyboard
2014-03-03 12:42:36	Konomi	it used to work ages back but somehow it stopped working
2014-03-03 12:42:59	bochecha	ibus-setup is the application that lets you set preferences for ibus
2014-03-03 12:43:03	Konomi	yes
2014-03-03 12:43:05	bochecha	one of which is the switcher shortcut
2014-03-03 12:43:09	bochecha	did you look at that?
2014-03-03 12:43:12	bochecha	it's not the icon
2014-03-03 12:43:12	Konomi	the daemon auto launches it for me
2014-03-03 12:43:22	bochecha	the icon is ibus-ui-gtk3
2014-03-03 12:43:23	Konomi	yeah I have it set to control sapce
2014-03-03 12:43:25	Konomi	which does nothing
2014-03-03 12:43:27	Konomi	yes
2014-03-03 12:43:52	Konomi	next input method: <Control>space
2014-03-03 12:44:04	Konomi	I have english US and anty for japanese
2014-03-03 12:44:10	bochecha	no idea then
2014-03-03 12:44:21	bochecha	I'm using GNOME, which takes care of the shortcuts itself
2014-03-03 12:44:25	Konomi	if I switch with the mouse ねこ　it works
2014-03-03 12:44:30	Konomi	if I press the shortcut
2014-03-03 12:44:30	bochecha	so I don't know how it's supposed to work with ibus only
2014-03-03 12:44:31	Konomi	nothing
2014-03-03 12:44:45	Konomi	is there anyway I can feed it a command from the console
2014-03-03 12:44:49	bochecha	wait a bit, you'll most likely find someone else who can help you ;)
2014-03-03 12:44:50	Konomi	I could just set one up with kde myself then
2014-03-03 12:44:54	Konomi	okay ^^
2014-03-03 12:49:24	Konomi	I did however figure I can use ibus-daemon with the -xim switch now so I no longer need to mess with switching kde to ibus which is nice
2014-03-03 12:51:53	Konomi	I'm not sure why there's so many methods it's kind of annoying
2014-03-03 12:52:08	Konomi	I found xim ibus cjk something and now fctix I think
2014-03-03 12:52:35	bochecha	well, everyone decided it would be a good idea to make their own Input Method Framework
2014-03-03 12:52:54	bochecha	just like everyone thought it was a good idea to make their own text editor, desktop environment, twitter app,... ;)
2014-03-03 12:53:05	Konomi	cue xkcd comic about standards?
2014-03-03 12:53:06	Konomi	hehe
2014-03-03 12:53:11	bochecha	:)
2014-03-03 12:53:23	bochecha	I'm glad GNOME decided to set on one IMF only
2014-03-03 12:53:46	bochecha	they chose IBus, but I'd have been equally happy with another one (I came to IBus after GNOME switched to it)
2014-03-03 12:54:05	bochecha	now we have a great input methods integration in GNOME, that prompted many improvements in IBus itself, etc...
2014-03-03 12:57:50	Konomi	kde seems to like xim by default
2014-03-03 12:58:17	Konomi	seems to work fine on ibus though
2014-03-03 13:10:59	fujiwarat	Konomi: Did you try ibus 1.5.x for the first time?
2014-03-03 13:11:07	Konomi	for the first time?
2014-03-03 13:11:42	Konomi	if you mean did I upgrade to 1.5.x and it started happening I am not sure
2014-03-03 13:11:45	Konomi	I got the problem ages back
2014-03-03 13:11:50	Konomi	it probably is related though
2014-03-03 13:11:51	fujiwarat	Did you use ibus 1.4 or other IMF previously?
2014-03-03 13:12:46	Konomi	I might of I never payed attention to versions sorry ;_;
2014-03-03 13:13:03	fujiwarat	Maybe you don't understand ibus 1.5.
2014-03-03 13:13:14	Konomi	it's a fair bet I did

2014-03-03 13:13:55	fujiwarat	The default shortcut key is Super+space now in ibus 1.5. Did you change the shortcut key to Ctrl+space?
2014-03-03 13:14:00	Konomi	yes I did
2014-03-03 13:14:30	fujiwarat	OK, and you need to keep to press Ctrl key and press space keys.
2014-03-03 13:14:41	Konomi	yes I press ctrl+space no change
2014-03-03 13:14:56	fujiwarat	Maybe you released Ctrl key.
2014-03-03 13:15:08	Konomi	pretty sure I know how to press keys ^^;

2014-03-03 13:16:01	Konomi	nwo it is space
2014-03-03 13:16:05	Konomi	and no changes

2014-03-03 13:16:38	Konomi	no gui is displayed
2014-03-03 13:17:05	Konomi	previously that would switch it and the icon in my system tray would change

2014-03-03 13:29:53	fujiwarat	Is the ibus panel icon shown on KDE panel status area?

2014-03-03 13:31:15	Konomi	no anthy listed
2014-03-03 13:31:21	Konomi	maybe that is the problem?
2014-03-03 13:31:23	fujiwarat	Are you able to switch the engines with ibus command?
2014-03-03 13:31:28	Konomi	yes
2014-03-03 13:31:35	Konomi	right clicking the icon and switching them works fine
2014-03-03 13:31:44	Konomi	erm left click
2014-03-03 13:32:02	Konomi	ねこ
2014-03-03 13:32:09	Konomi	for example
2014-03-03 13:32:14	fujiwarat	ibus list-engine can shows all engines including xkb:us::eng and anthy.
2014-03-03 13:32:28	Konomi	wow there is a ton
2014-03-03 13:32:34	Konomi	grepping
2014-03-03 13:32:36	fujiwarat	yes
2014-03-03 13:33:14	Konomi	$ ibus list-engine | grep -E 'anthy|:us::eng' anthy - Anthy xkb:us::eng - English (US)
2014-03-03 13:33:23	fujiwarat	If ibus engine command can switch engines, it would be the problem in ibus-ui-gtk3.
2014-03-03 13:33:53	Konomi	what is the command to switch
2014-03-03 13:34:02	fujiwarat	% ibus engine anthy
2014-03-03 13:34:08	fujiwarat	 % ibus engine xkb:us::eng
2014-03-03 13:34:27	Konomi	that works fine
2014-03-03 13:36:06	fujiwarat	Are you able to reproduce your problem with a new user account instead of the current user account?
2014-03-03 13:36:23	Konomi	urk I can't really do that atm I have programs I cannot close
2014-03-03 13:36:27	Konomi	I can get back to you though
2014-03-03 13:36:30	fujiwarat	ok
2014-03-03 13:36:50	Konomi	hmm
2014-03-03 13:36:55	Konomi	could test it on my other latpop though
2014-03-03 13:37:42	Konomi	same distro same updates etc
2014-03-03 13:37:57	fujiwarat	Also it would be great if you could try another desktop likes twm.
2014-03-03 13:38:22	Konomi	can probably do that too
2014-03-03 13:39:28	fujiwarat	Currently I don't see any problems in ibus-ui-gtk3.
2014-03-03 13:40:09	fujiwarat	btw, ibus-ui-gtk3 requires to open display.
2014-03-03 13:44:12	Konomi	okay so on my other pc never installed ibus or anthyu same bug old account same distro etc
2014-03-03 13:44:17	Konomi	trying a new user account
2014-03-03 14:03:20	Konomi	fujiwarat: wokrs on a new account
2014-03-03 14:03:23	Konomi	I get an osd
2014-03-03 14:03:48	fujiwarat	Konomi: ok, nice to hear that.
2014-03-03 14:04:43	Konomi	is there some user configuration folder I can get rid of?
2014-03-03 14:05:10	fujiwarat	Maybe
2014-03-03 14:05:26	fujiwarat	% gsettings list-recursively org.freedesktop.ibus.general
2014-03-03 14:05:36	fujiwarat	Backup the values and

2014-03-03 14:06:05	fujiwarat	Reset all the values.
2014-03-03 14:07:48	fujiwarat	And 'ibus restart' command.
2014-03-03 14:09:29	Konomi	hmm doesn't work
2014-03-03 14:09:42	Konomi	starting to wonder if it's themeing as my other machine didn't have gtk3 theme engines
2014-03-03 14:09:50	fujiwarat	ok and org.freedesktop.ibus.panel too.

2014-03-03 14:11:30	Konomi	not sure if this is concerning
2014-03-03 14:12:50	fujiwarat	It is an expected message and no problem. I think the same warning could be shown with new accounts too.
2014-03-03 14:14:47	Konomi	sigh I can't select anthy now cause the drop down menu is behaving very oddly
2014-03-03 14:15:39	fujiwarat	Do you mean the problem with a new user account?

2014-03-03 14:16:15	Konomi	still gettinmg ths on start now
2014-03-03 14:16:53	fujiwarat	But you said mouse click works fine but ctrl+space does not work?
2014-03-03 14:17:30	Konomi	now it won't work at all after resetting it...
2014-03-03 14:18:03	fujiwarat	Did you restart ibus-daemon with 'ibus restart' command?
2014-03-03 14:18:42	Konomi	fujiwarat: I made a mistake
2014-03-03 14:18:48	fujiwarat	ok
2014-03-03 14:18:48	Konomi	it works on my other machine with an old account
2014-03-03 14:19:04	Konomi	I just forgot to add anthy to the input list because I never used it on there before

2014-03-03 14:21:04	Konomi	yes son my other pc it works fine with an old account after I added a new input method
2014-03-03 14:21:11	Konomi	there was nothing to reset on it it didn't have ibus before this
2014-03-03 14:21:31	Konomi	all the themes are on and working too
2014-03-03 14:22:05	fujiwarat	ok, maybe you needed to restart ibus after you upgrade ibus.
2014-03-03 14:22:51	Konomi	tried no luck -.-

2014-03-03 14:23:16	Konomi	it doesn't have some sort of config directory in home does it?
2014-03-03 14:25:30	fujiwarat	If the problem is resolved after the gsettings values are reset, it would be a problem in user configuration and need to compare the list-recursively values.
2014-03-03 14:26:31	Konomi	hmm
2014-03-03 14:28:48	Konomi	no luck sadly
2014-03-03 14:29:15	fujiwarat	The user config is either kde config, ibus config or engine(anthy) config. I think your problem is fixed without reseting of kde config and engine config so it would be ibus config and ibus uses gsettings and bus cache.
2014-03-03 14:29:18	Konomi	yeah
2014-03-03 14:30:38	Konomi	just doesn't want to work so annoying
2014-03-03 14:31:37	Konomi	could try purging it all and resinstalling
2014-03-03 14:31:42	Konomi	that's all I can think of now
2014-03-03 14:32:05	fujiwarat	It would be great if you could identify the problem configuration. Otherwise it's fine now your ibus works.
2014-03-03 14:32:28	Konomi	only on my other computer meh xD
2014-03-03 14:32:35	Konomi	thanks for the help >.<
2014-03-03 14:32:36	fujiwarat	:)

2014-03-03 14:41:20	fujiwarat	Also bus settings are saved in $HOME/ .config/ibus .

2014-03-03 15:12:48	Konomi	I remember I added some enivorment varaibles that were overiding xim as a input method
2014-03-03 15:12:56	Konomi	I think your reset of settings fixed the issue
2014-03-03 15:13:04	Konomi	but I fogot to remove the old ibus settings
2014-03-03 15:13:21	Konomi	I still had these:
2014-03-03 15:13:26	Konomi	export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
2014-03-03 15:13:29	Konomi	export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
2014-03-03 15:13:31	Konomi	export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
2014-03-03 15:13:41	Konomi	I also noticed ibus autostarts again that wasn't worthing either and it's fixed too
2014-03-03 15:13:47	Konomi	working*
2014-03-03 15:14:27	Konomi	so glad to have that fixed
2014-03-03 15:17:14	fujiwarat	I don't know which application exports those environment values in Debian.
2014-03-03 15:17:16	Konomi	fujiwarat: btw it seems ctrl+space is the default for new installs of ibus on debiam not sure why
2014-03-03 15:17:25	Konomi	it was in /etc/enviroment for me
2014-03-03 15:17:31	Konomi	I added them when I was debugging earlier
2014-03-03 15:17:37	Konomi	just removed them and it's working now
2014-03-03 15:17:48	Konomi	but it was broken before I added them
2014-03-03 15:18:07	Konomi	so I can only presume either deleteing ~/.config/ibus* fixed it or the gsettings reset you gave me did
2014-03-03 15:18:41	Konomi	either way it is fixed thankfully
2014-03-03 15:18:50	Konomi	thanks for all your time
2014-03-03 15:22:43	fujiwarat	ibus itself does not set any env values.
2014-03-03 15:24:59	Konomi	yeah I know I set them
2014-03-03 15:25:08	Konomi	it does suggest to do it if you start it up with ibus-setup
2014-03-03 15:25:41	Konomi	at least it did before
2014-03-03 15:26:33	Konomi	"IBus has been started! If you cannot use IBus, please add below lines in $HOME/.bashrc, and relogin your desktop."
2014-03-03 15:26:52	fujiwarat	Yeah, ibus does not set those env values but you need to set them. im-chooser is available in Fedora but I don't know about Debian.
2014-03-03 15:27:00	Konomi	me either
2014-03-03 15:27:12	Konomi	see orginally this was set for ibus
2014-03-03 15:27:19	Konomi	though I decided to set it all back to xim
2014-03-03 15:27:49	Konomi	it seems to be handled better for kde now compared to last time though they just start it with --xim now
2014-03-03 15:28:36	bochecha	I don't know about Debian, but in Ubuntu they have a /etc/init.d/ script to start ibus
2014-03-03 15:28:49	bochecha	which I found very weird as ibus is a session service, not a system one :-/
2014-03-03 15:29:02	Konomi	not sure how ibus would start from that
2014-03-03 15:29:16	Konomi	no init script for me
2014-03-03 15:33:10	fujiwarat	Konomi: Maybe you could google 'debian ibus GTK_IM_MODULE' :).
2014-03-03 15:43:33	Konomi	I am at a loss of how it starts up on my system automatically I can't find where hehe
2014-03-03 15:45:44	bochecha	Konomi: /etc/xdg/autostart/ ?
2014-03-03 15:46:01	Konomi	doesn't exist
2014-03-03 15:46:23	Konomi	I think dconf might be handling it
2014-03-03 15:47:22	bochecha	I don't think so, dconf is a settings registry
2014-03-03 15:47:31	Konomi	hmm idk then
2014-03-03 15:47:53	Konomi	I can't find any start up in any of the places this page lists: http://code.google.com/p/ibus/wiki/IBusStartUpTroubleShooting
2014-03-03 15:47:57	Konomi	so I am not sure how it starts on debian
2014-03-03 15:47:59	Konomi	it definitly does
2014-03-03 15:48:01	Konomi	no idea how
2014-03-03 15:48:17	bochecha	sometimes you don't want to know, just enjoy the fact that it works :)
2014-03-03 15:48:24	Konomi	true xD
2014-03-03 15:48:50	fujiwarat	Did you google the words? it's not an ibus issue in upstream exactly but dowstream.
2014-03-03 15:49:06	Konomi	I did but I didn't find much and I'm not sure what you're refering to
2014-03-03 15:49:13	fujiwarat	s/dowstream/downstream/
2014-03-03 15:50:05	fujiwarat	I think you will find the way easily or you could ask a downstream mailing-list.
2014-03-03 15:50:24	Konomi	hmm I guess so

2014-03-03 18:20:35	anish_	fujiwarat, i am compiling IBus and i am getting error /bin/sh: gsettings-schema-convert: command not found
2014-03-03 18:20:50	anish_	did i miss anything? 
2014-03-03 18:23:07	fujiwarat	anish_: Why don't you use fedora ibus.spec ?
2014-03-03 18:23:38	fujiwarat	It includes the BRs.
2014-03-03 18:23:55	anish_	fujiwarat, i did clone github 
2014-03-03 18:25:26	bochecha	anish_: yum-buildep ibus
2014-03-03 18:25:30	bochecha	that should help anyway ;)
2014-03-03 18:25:59	fujiwarat	It would be easy to use fedora srpm if you haven't ever tries ibus yet. Porting the fedora patch to github is not so difficult.
2014-03-03 18:26:59	anish_	fujiwarat, bochecha thanks! looking into it

2014-03-04 12:17:02	riaqn	ibus doesn't follow my cursor when inputing……is it a bug or just me?
2014-03-04 12:27:39	anish_	riaqn, which input method do you use?
2014-03-04 12:28:02	riaqn	anish_: ibus-pinyin
2014-03-04 12:29:48	anish_	riaqn, i don't know much about ibus-pinyin,but in other input methods follow cursor 
2014-03-04 12:30:50	bochecha	anish_: I've had some cases where the candidates popup was not next to the cursor (gnome-shell)
2014-03-04 12:31:00	bochecha	it seems to happen randomly, I can't reproduce it ever
2014-03-04 12:31:15	riaqn	anish_: Well, I 'm moving back to fcitx, which does the following very well.
2014-03-04 12:31:41	bochecha	even if I just hit backspace to cancel the input they try again (without doing anything else, especially not moving the cursor), then the cursor usually comes back to the right place :-/
2014-03-04 12:32:04	bochecha	riaqn: for what is worth, I think ibus-pinyin is kind of deprecated, and ibus-libpinyin should be preferred
2014-03-04 12:32:16	bochecha	riaqn: probably wouldn't fix your issue, though
2014-03-04 12:33:14	riaqn	bochecha: I will check it out.Thx
2014-03-04 12:33:57	riaqn	What is interesting, is that on my distribution(gentoo), there is only fcitx-libpinyin, no ibus-libpinyin.haha
2014-03-04 12:34:27	anish_	bochecha, did you observe this in gnome-shell, sometimes i face this issue in some browsers ( web applications )where they use java script 
2014-03-04 12:34:29	riaqn	So anyway I 'm ready to back to fcitx. sigh.
2014-03-04 12:34:39	bochecha	anish_: yes, in gnome-shell
2014-03-04 12:34:49	bochecha	now that you mention it, I think I only saw it in Firefox
2014-03-04 12:34:53	bochecha	but not in web apps
2014-03-04 12:35:24	bochecha	I absolutely remember trying to type something in the search bar (top-right of the firefox UI) and the candidates popup appearing somewhere else
2014-03-04 12:38:51	anish_	bochecha, sometimes input methods(i-t-b) behaves wired when web app has their own editor and editor's keystrokes are controlled by java script 
2014-03-04 12:39:00	anish_	e.g sometimes in gmail 
2014-03-04 12:39:08	bochecha	i-t-b ?
2014-03-04 12:39:16	anish_	typing booster
2014-03-04 12:39:30	bochecha	I don't think it's related to the engine itself
2014-03-04 12:39:44	anish_	yeah
2014-03-04 12:39:58	bochecha	the engine isn't (or at least shouldn't) be responsible for displaying the candidates popup
2014-03-04 12:40:10	bochecha	gnome-shell is (and on other desktops, ibus-ui-gtk3 iirc?)
2014-03-04 12:40:46	anish_	yeah 
2014-03-04 12:42:21	bochecha	hmmm
2014-03-04 12:42:24	bochecha	thinking some more about it
2014-03-04 12:42:40	bochecha	when typing in the firefox search bar, it handles input to try and display suggestions for searches
2014-03-04 12:43:01	bochecha	which does sound similar to your case with webapps handling input as well for their own editors
2014-03-04 12:43:33	bochecha	could it be a conflict of two thngs (ibus and the app input handling) both trying to handle the input and display some suggestions?

2014-03-04 12:47:08	anish_	bochecha, not sure about that may be its because in some cases gnome-shell or ibus-ui does not get appropriate event as that is been handled by firefox UI itself 
2014-03-04 12:47:24	bochecha	yeah, could be :(
2014-03-04 12:47:50	bochecha	which means it's not really fixable (well, at least in those cases, dunno about the one riaqn was seeing)

2014-03-05 22:15:37	Lars_G	Hello.
2014-03-05 22:16:19	Lars_G	I'v been having troubles trying to setup ibus.... it's been an uphill battle since I have a spanish keyboard and dead characters, like ' used for á didn't work anywhere...
2014-03-05 22:17:49	Lars_G	by now, I've added the gtk and qt input modules, and this works almost everywhere (I'm unsure right now if I have any xim only based programs left).... but some of my encodings when ibus is "turned off" are wrong... basically my alt-gr + 1 2 or 3 are wrong and it's a real pita daily.... I've revised layouts everywhere I can think of.... but can't find a solution... any ideas please?

2014-03-05 23:42:18	bochecha	rtcm, hi, we were talking with anish the other day about a problem where sometimes gnome-shell displays the candidate popup somewhere else than where the cursor is
2014-03-05 23:42:24	bochecha	rtcm, would you happen to have an idea?
2014-03-05 23:43:12	bochecha	I'm seeing it in Firefox here, when I type in the google search bar (top-right of the window), the candidates popup appears in the bottom-left of the screen
2014-03-05 23:54:06	rtcm	bochecha: sounds like firefox isn't setting the cursor coordinates correctly in that case
2014-03-05 23:54:27	rtcm	that'd be my guess anyway
2014-03-05 23:54:36	bochecha	oh, so it's the responsibility of the application to tell ibus/gnome-shell where the cursor is?
2014-03-05 23:54:48	 *	bochecha doesn't know anything about this stuff, just trying to understand :)
2014-03-05 23:55:00	rtcm	yes, for regular gtk+ apps the toolkit handles all of it, but firefox isn't a regular gtk+ app
2014-03-05 23:55:11	bochecha	I see
2014-03-05 23:55:56	bochecha	is there any way to investigate this, before reporting the bug on firefox? a way to make sure that firefox really is doing this badly?
2014-03-06 00:00:01	rtcm	gdb :-)
2014-03-06 00:00:55	rtcm	I can give it a try later/tomorrow, I'm busy with other stuff and can't easily do it now
2014-03-06 00:01:22	rtcm	I can also ask one of the firefox guys here in the office but they're not here today
2014-03-06 00:02:47	bochecha	ah, that would be nice, as either of you or them would know much better than me what to look for :)

2014-03-07 22:05:17	mfabian	rtcm: to make a setup icon appear in “gnome-control-center region” for the ibus-table engines, I need /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-table.desktop, right?
2014-03-07 22:05:25	mfabian	rtcm: When is this picked up?
2014-03-07 22:05:41	mfabian	rtcm: When “gnome-control-center” starts?
2014-03-07 22:06:05	rtcm	mfabian: when it starts, yes
2014-03-07 22:06:17	rtcm	forget what's the exact rule for the .desktop file
2014-03-07 22:08:11	mfabian	rtcm: http://paste.fedoraproject.org/83353/
2014-03-07 22:08:38	mfabian	rtcm: I made the desktop file for ibus-table look the same as the desktop file for ibus-typing-booster.
2014-03-07 22:08:50	mfabian	Now I wonder why it works for ibus-typing-booster but not for ibus-table ...
2014-03-07 22:10:20	rtcm	mfabian: the .desktop file needs to be named ibus-setup-%s.desktop
2014-03-07 22:10:31	rtcm	where %s is the ibus engine id
2014-03-07 22:12:30	rtcm	oh table is one of those where the <engines> section is created from xml...
2014-03-07 22:12:31	rtcm	/usr/libexec/ibus-engine-table --xml
2014-03-07 22:12:54	rtcm	i.e. there's no single table engine, right?
2014-03-07 22:13:00	mfabian	$ ibus list-engine | grep typing-booster:en_AG
2014-03-07 22:13:01	mfabian	  typing-booster:en_AG - English - AG (Hunspell)
2014-03-07 22:13:01	mfabian	 
2014-03-07 22:13:11	rtcm	so you'd have to have .desktop files for all of them I think
2014-03-07 22:13:11	mfabian	$ ibus list-engine | grep stroke5
2014-03-07 22:13:15	mfabian	  stroke5 - stroke5
2014-03-07 22:13:18	mfabian	 
2014-03-07 22:13:22	mfabian	stroke5 is one of the many engines of ibus-table.
2014-03-07 22:13:34	rtcm	right so you need a ibus-setup-stroke5.desktop file
2014-03-07 22:13:39	mfabian	So I probably need to make the engine id look like "table:stroke5" instead?
2014-03-07 22:14:00	rtcm	if that makes any sense...
2014-03-07 22:14:21	mfabian	for ibus-typing-booster, only one desktop file exists: /usr/share/applications/ibus-setup-typing-booster.desktop
2014-03-07 22:14:24	rtcm	but yeah, technically that would work
2014-03-07 22:14:38	mfabian	The : is parsed by gnome-control-center?
2014-03-07 22:14:55	rtcm	right, because I simplified things, I should have said that the %s is indeed whatever some up before ':' in the engine id
2014-03-07 22:15:09	mfabian	Ah, OK, then I understand it!
2014-03-07 22:15:11	rtcm	s/some/comes
2014-03-07 22:15:14	mfabian	Thank you very much!

2014-03-12 15:21:18	lewtds	hi. From an engine's context, how can I know if IBus is sharing the same input method among all applications?
2014-03-12 15:23:50	bochecha	I don't think you can, but.... why would it matter?
2014-03-12 15:24:01	bochecha	(note: I'm an engine author, like you I guess :) )
2014-03-12 15:24:45	anish__	in ibusbus.h it has an API IBusInputContext *

2014-03-12 15:25:13	anish__	but not sure why you need that in an engine?
2014-03-12 15:27:15	<--	mazes_80 (~sam@45.218.19.109.rev.sfr.net) has quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
2014-03-12 15:40:00	lewtds	thanks bochecha and anish__
2014-03-12 15:43:08	lewtds	on second thought, maybe I don't really need it that much.
2014-03-12 15:45:29	lewtds	btw, have you guys seen/are working with an input method that uses surrounding text exclusively instead of preediting?
2014-03-12 15:49:51	bochecha	lewtds: my engine doesn't use preedit at all
2014-03-12 15:49:58	bochecha	and I was about to talk to rtcm about that :)
2014-03-12 15:50:08	lewtds	bochecha, interesting
2014-03-12 15:50:23	lewtds	would you mind to elaborate?
2014-03-12 15:50:43	bochecha	rtcm: remember the other day, I told you we were seeing problem with firefox, where the popup candidate didn't appear next to the text cursor, but "somewhere else" in the screen?
2014-03-12 15:51:01	bochecha	rtcm: turns out that if I modify ibus-cangjie to make it use preedit, then the popup candidate always appear in the right place
2014-03-12 15:51:30	bochecha	rtcm: so the problem appears when we don't use preedit (which we don't want to do
2014-03-12 15:51:44	-->	mazes_80 (~sam@45.218.19.109.rev.sfr.net) has joined #ibus
2014-03-12 15:51:50	bochecha	rtcm: iirc, there was a problem like that in the past, around GNOME 3.6 or 38, which you had fixed?
2014-03-12 15:51:57	bochecha	lewtds: what do you want me to elaborate?
2014-03-12 15:52:11	lewtds	I've seen that bug once. You can pretend to you preedit to make the popup appears at the correct position and then not showing anything with the preedit
2014-03-12 15:52:38	bochecha	yeah
2014-03-12 15:52:38	lewtds	bochecha: I'd love to be able to take a look at its source code.
2014-03-12 15:52:45	lewtds	* use
2014-03-12 15:52:56	bochecha	I just tested exactly that: setting some preedit for my engine, and the problem disappears
2014-03-12 15:53:02	bochecha	but that's wrong, we shouldn't have to do that ;)
2014-03-12 15:53:08	lewtds	agree
2014-03-12 15:53:18	bochecha	lewtds: here it is: https://github.com/cangjians/ibus-cangjie :)
2014-03-12 15:53:51	lewtds	thanks
2014-03-12 15:59:56	lewtds	bochecha, so basically ur using the auxiliary text feature in the same way as the preedit text feature
2014-03-12 16:00:05	lewtds	Am I wrong?

2014-03-12 16:13:14	bochecha	more or less, yes
2014-03-12 16:13:34	bochecha	that's how cangjie/quick users expect the input method to work (it's how it works on other platforms)
2014-03-12 16:14:34	anish__	lewtds, https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/ibus-typing-booster.git/tree/ibus-typing-booster/engine/hunspell_table.py#n659
2014-03-12 16:15:10	anish__	lewtds, this way you can get surrounding text 
2014-03-12 16:16:29	lewtds	thanks anish__ 
2014-03-12 16:21:50	lewtds	the surround text situation is still pretty with several high profile input contexts not behaving correctly (advertising support while they really don't) such as Google Chrome, Unity Dash, Gnome Terminal, etc. just to name a few.
2014-03-12 16:22:03	lewtds	* pretty mixed
2014-03-12 16:22:49	lewtds	what I want to be able to do is to replace preediting with surrounding text completely
2014-03-12 16:23:06	lewtds	because that's what Vietnamese users moving from Windows expect
2014-03-12 16:24:03	lewtds	all Vietnamese IME on Windows simulate preedit by sending fake backspaces to the focused applications
2014-03-12 16:25:24	anish__	lewtds,i don't understand replace preedit with surrounding text 
2014-03-12 16:25:32	lewtds	this method has one very big advantage against using preedit in that the user
2014-03-12 16:25:44	lewtds	doesn't have to "confirm" the preedit text
2014-03-12 16:26:45	lewtds	whatever you type in the app stays there
2014-03-12 16:27:12	lewtds	whilst with preedit, you have to press some control keys to make sure that the text gets in
2014-03-12 16:28:46	lewtds	typing Vietnamese doesn't involve searching and selecting candidates like with Chinese or Japanese
2014-03-12 16:29:09	lewtds	instead we have a fairly simple translation rule
2014-03-12 16:29:10	lewtds	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex_%28IME%29
2014-03-12 16:29:47	lewtds	so we don't need a final confirmation step like the other languages
2014-03-12 16:33:37	anish__	lewtds, i think you don't have to deal with surrounding text that much just you need to arrange preedit each time depending on user input
2014-03-12 16:36:31	lewtds	yeah, that's what I'm doing now
2014-03-12 16:36:47	lewtds	but it's still not satisfactory
2014-03-12 16:36:58	lewtds	'cause at the end of a sentence
2014-03-12 16:37:20	lewtds	there will always be a word that is being preedited
2014-03-12 16:37:29	lewtds	even though the user has finished typing
2014-03-12 16:38:16	lewtds	most users get very confused at this behavior, some calling it the "annoying underlined word".
2014-03-12 16:38:50	lewtds	They have to learn to press some keys (like Control, or Shift) to commit that final word.
2014-03-12 16:39:02	lewtds	And as you all know, users don't learn.
2014-03-12 16:39:09	anish__	lewtds, how do you commit the word
2014-03-12 16:39:25	anish__	by space
2014-03-12 16:39:55	lewtds	yup, normally, between words in a sentence, a space would trigger a commit.
2014-03-12 16:40:24	lewtds	It's the final word at the end that's annoying.
2014-03-12 16:40:45	lewtds	some users develop a habit of pressing yet another space at the end (to commit)
2014-03-12 16:41:00	lewtds	and then pressing backspace to delete that trick space
2014-03-12 16:42:14	anish__	https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/ibus-typing-booster.git/tree/ibus-typing-booster/engine/hunspell_table.py#n650
2014-03-12 16:44:18	bochecha	lewtds: I might be completely out in the woods, but if sentences end generally with a fullstop, can't you commit on that fullstop?
2014-03-12 16:44:48	lewtds	true, but not in chatrooms = )
2014-03-12 16:44:58	lewtds	and facebook, etc.
2014-03-12 16:45:06	bochecha	yeah, you have to commit on smiley input :P
2014-03-12 16:45:45	lewtds	but a smiley already comes after a space ;)
2014-03-12 16:46:41	lewtds	so, yeah, that's pretty much why I want to move to surrounding text full-time.
2014-03-12 16:46:58	lewtds	sadly it's not quite ready yet.
2014-03-12 16:46:59	bochecha	yeah, in your case it definitely makes sense
2014-03-12 16:47:30	bochecha	maybe if more input methods used surrounding text, then those input contexts you mentioned would have more incentive to be fixed?
2014-03-12 16:47:56	bochecha	for example, it seems nobody ever did an input method with auxiliary but without preedit like I'm doing, as I've been hitting a few bugs with that
2014-03-12 16:48:03	bochecha	which are all getting fixed one after the other :)
2014-03-12 16:48:09	lewtds	nice one :)
2014-03-12 16:48:30	lewtds	I've never even tried aux text.
2014-03-12 16:48:44	bochecha	yeah, I don't think it would work in your case
2014-03-12 16:49:01	bochecha	auxiliary text is like preedit, but it's in the candidates popup instead of being at the text cursor
2014-03-12 16:50:33	lewtds	If it serves the same function as preedit, why should one use it?
2014-03-12 16:51:14	lewtds	shouldn't it be more natural to see the text being edited in its text editor field?
2014-03-12 16:59:30	bochecha	it basically depends on the input method itself, using preedit means the text at the cursor keeps moving, which can be problematic for some input methods
2014-03-12 16:59:57	bochecha	and realistically, the auxiliary text appears in the candidate popups, which is (supposed to be) just next to the cursor

2014-03-13 13:55:00	lewtds	I'm pretty sure VTE should be able to respond to that change easily
2014-03-13 13:55:20	lewtds	in a direct manner, no parsing required
2014-03-13 13:56:42	fujiwarat	right. I still think it could complicate.
2014-03-13 13:57:51	fujiwarat	I wanted if TERMINAL can resolve your problem at first.
2014-03-13 13:58:52	fujiwarat	Now then probably vte needs to check the echo mode.
2014-03-13 14:01:38	lewtds	I'm not sure what IBus or my engine should do when it sees a TERMINAL purpose input field
2014-03-13 14:02:16	lewtds	should it stop processing? Obviously not what ppl want since they need to type that article in Vim.
2014-03-13 14:03:45	fujiwarat	ok, I see.
2014-03-13 14:40:03	lewtds	After some pondering, I think the plan to set PASSWORD purpose on no echo might not work with Vim either. Vim's input mode may not actually turn echo mode back on but does controlled echoing instead. Which is still in no echo mode.
2014-03-13 14:41:05	lewtds	so we are still stuck with password being disclosed in the sudo prompt
2014-03-13 14:42:07	fujiwarat	lewtds: nice to hear your evaluation.

2014-03-13 16:55:55	lewtds	bringing surrrounding text to gnome terminal and every other terminal emulator using gnome's libvte
2014-03-13 16:55:56	lewtds	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726191
2014-03-13 17:05:41	bochecha	lewtds: so with that change your input method can use surrounding text on a password prompt, without the password (i.e the surrounding text) being shown to the user?
2014-03-13 17:06:38	lewtds	yeah, that's also another advantage over preedit
2014-03-13 17:06:57	lewtds	but pushing that preedit bug benefits everyone
2014-03-13 17:09:16	bochecha	preedit is different
2014-03-13 17:09:44	bochecha	in the case of an input method working with preedit, I think you really want the preedit to be show on the password prompt, but not the committed text
2014-03-13 17:10:03	bochecha	because the committed text is what ends up being the password, not the preedit text
2014-03-13 17:10:55	lewtds	but in the end, anyone behind your back can still see it
2014-03-13 17:11:52	lewtds	personally, I think input methods shouldn't be allowed in password fields at all
2014-03-13 17:12:02	lewtds	passwords should all be ascii
2014-03-13 17:13:14	bochecha	that's another way to do it
2014-03-13 17:13:27	bochecha	but then, the user must know that the input method is not being used
2014-03-13 17:14:09	lewtds	I believe we are already doing it this way
2014-03-13 17:14:47	lewtds	Gtk entry with a password purpose are typed in with ibus automatically disabled
2014-03-13 17:14:54	bochecha	lewtds: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699664
2014-03-13 17:15:00	bochecha	yeah, ibus is disabled
2014-03-13 17:15:06	bochecha	but the user doesn't **know** that it is
2014-03-13 17:15:32	bochecha	so a user might think that he's typing chinese, when in fact he's entering a random succession of letters and numbers and spaces, in the US keyboard layout
2014-03-13 17:15:55	bochecha	which can lead to users not being able to log in any more
2014-03-13 17:16:03	lewtds	wonder if anyone actually sets up password in real Chinese :-?
2014-03-13 17:16:30	bochecha	who knows?
2014-03-13 17:16:55	bochecha	there is no indication that non-latin characters are not allowed for passwords
2014-03-13 17:17:15	bochecha	i.e that the input method is disabled
2014-03-13 17:17:38	bochecha	without such indication, we end up giving the user wrong expectations, and potentially preventing them from logging in
2014-03-13 17:18:03	bochecha	(my last comment explains how that would happen in details)
2014-03-13 17:18:39	bochecha	especially since GDM allows typing a password with an input method, which makes everything even more confusing :(
2014-03-13 17:21:00	rtcm	bochecha: pretty sure gdm doesn't
2014-03-13 17:21:21	rtcm	since we don't allow IMEs in the gdm session
2014-03-13 17:21:27	bochecha	rtcm: I actually tested this on 3.10
2014-03-13 17:21:52	rtcm	bochecha: g-c-c doesn't have a way to export ibus input sources to the login screen
2014-03-13 17:22:01	rtcm	or do you mean the lock screen ?
2014-03-13 17:22:14	bochecha	ah. maybe the lock screen, yes
2014-03-13 17:22:34	bochecha	that being said, Ondrej Holy was saying also that GDM does allow it
2014-03-13 17:22:49	rtcm	hmm, I thought gnome-shell's password entries were setting the PASSWORD hint
2014-03-13 17:23:09	rtcm	he was likely thinkning of the lock screen too
2014-03-13 17:23:13	 *	rtcm checks
2014-03-13 17:23:20	bochecha	rtcm: setting a password hint isn't sufficient, though, unfortunately :(
2014-03-13 17:24:06	lewtds	I'm on GS 3.10 and the lockscreen doesn't have an input method
2014-03-13 17:24:48	bochecha	lewtds: it does here
2014-03-13 17:26:09	lewtds	nope, checked twice, first with Dvorak selected before lock, then with anthy
2014-03-13 17:26:17	lewtds	Ubuntu 14.04
2014-03-13 17:26:27	bochecha	fedora 20, gnome 3.10
2014-03-13 17:26:39	bochecha	I have the input methods in the lock screen, I just tried again
2014-03-13 17:27:12	lewtds	wait
2014-03-13 17:27:31	lewtds	is your lockscreen the one drawn by GS
2014-03-13 17:27:34	lewtds	and not a dialog box?
2014-03-13 17:27:42	lewtds	* generic Gtk dialog box
2014-03-13 17:28:12	bochecha	yeah, the lockscreen is the GNOME Shell one, what else would it be?
2014-03-13 17:28:20	lewtds	IIRC
2014-03-13 17:28:27	lewtds	Ubuntu uses their own lockscreen
2014-03-13 17:28:33	bochecha	sigh :(
2014-03-13 17:33:00	rtcm	bochecha: right, I know it's not enough, still we do set the hint :-)
2014-03-13 17:35:08	rtcm	bochecha: actually, the "user awareness" issue can be solved by the engine I think
2014-03-13 17:35:41	lewtds	is there any design guideline regarding this?
2014-03-13 17:35:44	rtcm	if the engine sees the password hint, it can change its indicator icon
2014-03-13 17:36:03	rtcm	lewtds: not that I know
2014-03-13 17:37:34	bochecha	rtcm: how?
2014-03-13 17:37:51	bochecha	and changing its indicator icon to what?
2014-03-13 17:38:02	<--	epico (~epico@1.202.241.197) has quit (Quit: 离开)
2014-03-13 17:38:12	bochecha	why not just prevent the user to switch to an input method when in a password field?
2014-03-13 17:38:28	rtcm	bochecha: remind me, does the engine get the input purpose hint or does it get handled transparently by ibus ?
2014-03-13 17:38:35	bochecha	I have no idea :)
2014-03-13 17:38:45	rtcm	bochecha: because gnome-shell doesn't know about it
2014-03-13 17:39:08	rtcm	I mean, we know when its one of shell's entries, but in general (for apps) we don't know
2014-03-13 17:39:09	lewtds	rtcm, there is a signal for that in the engine
2014-03-13 17:39:20	bochecha	but if IBus knows about it, couldn't ibus mark some engines are unavailable, so that gnome-shell wouldn't let the user switch to them?
2014-03-13 17:40:16	lewtds	I think we should update this document to reflect better our policy on password entry
2014-03-13 17:40:17	bochecha	Mac OS X does this, if you are in a password prompt, then their "input source menu" has the input methods greyed out, so you can select them at all
2014-03-13 17:40:17	lewtds	https://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/stable/controls-entry.html.en
2014-03-13 17:40:50	bochecha	which means it's obvious to the user what is happening on MAC OS X: they can't use input methods to input a password, and there is no risk for error
2014-03-13 17:40:51	lewtds	oh, btw, engines can't change icon
2014-03-13 17:41:41	lewtds	it's a static field in the XML used for registering the engine
2014-03-13 17:41:47	bochecha	lewtds: yeah
2014-03-13 17:42:02	lewtds	I was about to report this issue some other day
2014-03-13 17:42:22	rtcm	bochecha: could be something like that yes, or all engines could have a "direct input" mode like japanese engines do (at least anthy and kkc)
2014-03-13 17:42:45	rtcm	lewtds: there is, though I guess not documented at all
2014-03-13 17:42:47	bochecha	but how would the user know that the engine was switched to that "direct input" mode?
2014-03-13 17:42:51	rtcm	again, anthy and kkc do it
2014-03-13 17:43:16	rtcm	the icon changes to a "A_"
2014-03-13 17:43:22	bochecha	ok
2014-03-13 17:43:39	bochecha	it's putting the burden on all engine developers, though, when the platform could fix it for everyone :(
2014-03-13 17:44:04	lewtds	agree
2014-03-13 17:44:22	rtcm	yeah, that's true
2014-03-13 17:45:01	rtcm	(to switch the icon you need to use a property called "InputMode"
2014-03-13 17:45:32	lewtds	how about when seeing a PASSWORD hint, IBus applies some graphical effect to the active icon then pause processing?
2014-03-13 17:45:52	bochecha	lewtds: that leads to another problem
2014-03-13 17:45:56	rtcm	bochecha: so yeah, we'd need IBus to throw out a signal when it sees the hint
2014-03-13 17:45:56	bochecha	how does the user knows which keyboard layout is being used?
2014-03-13 17:46:49	rtcm	that way the panel (gnome-shell, etc.) can do something sensible
2014-03-13 17:46:55	bochecha	cool :)
2014-03-13 17:47:15	-->	epico (~epico@1.202.241.197) has joined #ibus
2014-03-13 17:47:17	bochecha	fujiwarat: do you think that would be possible?
2014-03-13 17:47:53	fujiwarat	lewtds: ibus-anthy already handles PURPOSE_PASSWORD for gnome-shell.
2014-03-13 17:48:38	fujiwarat	https://github.com/ibus/ibus-anthy/commit/6aae0a9f145f536515e268dd6b25aa740a5edfe7
2014-03-13 17:48:43	lewtds	I thought PURPOSE_PASSWORD is handled by IBus?
2014-03-13 17:48:47	rtcm	fujiwarat: we were discussing having a new signal from ibus to the panel so that the panel is aware of this
2014-03-13 17:48:49	fujiwarat	yes
2014-03-13 17:50:05	fujiwarat	rtcm: "InputMode" property could resolve the issue?
2014-03-13 17:50:24	fujiwarat	lewtds: the latest ibus forward PURPOSE_PASSWORD to each engine.
2014-03-13 17:50:43	bochecha	fujiwarat: could it forward it to the panel/shell instead?
2014-03-13 17:50:52	rtcm	fujiwarat: right, engines can do it right now, but we were talking about having something generic that all engines could benefit from
2014-03-13 17:50:55	lewtds	that kinds of defeat the purpose
2014-03-13 17:51:14	lewtds	and directly against bochecha's point
2014-03-13 17:53:30	lewtds	hmm, we used to have an "off" mode. That would fit here quite well.
2014-03-13 17:54:51	lewtds	It would show the generic IBus logo and the user can naturally deduce that they are typing with the underlying layout.
2014-03-13 17:55:12	bochecha	lewtds: how do they know the underlying layout?
2014-03-13 17:55:24	fujiwarat	rtcm: It has been already implemented in engine while i don't like it. Maybe some engines without preedit like to handle the process_key_event. panel handles lookup table only?
2014-03-13 17:55:55	lewtds	bochecha: users are used to turning IBus on and off so of course they know the underlying layout
2014-03-13 17:56:17	bochecha	lewtds: in gnome, you just switch input sources, you don't turn ibus on or off
2014-03-13 17:56:35	bochecha	lewtds: for example, at home, I switch between the French keyboard layout and the Cangjie input method
2014-03-13 17:56:35	lewtds	Yeah I know, I said "we used to".
2014-03-13 17:57:47	bochecha	the underlying keyboard layout for Cangjie is US (I know, because I'm the developer)
2014-03-13 17:58:09	bochecha	but letting me input my password with the US keyboard layout doesn't seem like the best idea ever, if my only configured layout is French
2014-03-13 17:58:48	bochecha	which is why I think that the panel should disable input method switching entirely
2014-03-13 17:58:54	rtcm	fujiwarat: hmm, but if the panel was aware of hint, it could e.g. disable access to input methods for instance
2014-03-13 17:59:20	fujiwarat	bochecha: IME layout can be changed by ibus component xml file.
2014-03-13 17:59:39	bochecha	fujiwarat: I know that, I'm the developer of an engine
2014-03-13 17:59:43	rtcm	let's not mix that isssue here please :-)
2014-03-13 17:59:54	bochecha	fujiwarat: you can't expect users to go and look at that, or even to modify it
2014-03-13 18:00:20	<--	epico (~epico@1.202.241.197) has quit (Quit: 离开)
2014-03-13 18:02:04	bochecha	rtcm: well, the fact that users don't know the underlying layout is an example of problems that arise when we let them switch to an input method to input a password
2014-03-13 18:02:04	fujiwarat	rtcm: It might mean we need to deprecate the current engine APIs for hints.
2014-03-13 18:02:32	lewtds	I and my friends are quite emotional about you guys' decision to mix layouts and IMEs (we all use Dvorak). But let's keep that for later.
2014-03-13 18:03:07	rtcm	lewtds: right, that's why I'd like to keep that as a separate topic :-)
2014-03-13 18:04:03	rtcm	fujiwarat: yeah :-/
2014-03-13 18:04:32	bochecha	why deprecate it? you can't just send a new signal in addition?
2014-03-13 18:04:34	rtcm	no point in having the API for engines if the panel will always prevent them from working
2014-03-13 18:04:56	bochecha	well, the panel will only prevent them from working with the password hint, there might be other hints, though?
2014-03-13 18:05:10	rtcm	right right
2014-03-13 18:05:54	fujiwarat	bochecha: Currently ibus engine receives set-content-type signals but probably the new suggestion the signal won't happen.
2014-03-13 18:06:31	fujiwarat	s/the new suggestion/the new suggestion means/
2014-03-13 18:08:38	fujiwarat	The current engine API emits both purpose and hints.
2014-03-13 18:09:47	fujiwarat	The signal is already handled by almost major engine.
2014-03-13 18:09:50	lewtds	no, what they mean is that only the PASSWORD hint get routed to the panel
2014-03-13 18:10:01	lewtds	the rest are untouched
2014-03-13 18:11:18	lewtds	you may even still allow the engine to get it, wouldn't hurt
2014-03-13 18:11:44	fujiwarat	So if the PASSWORD purpose is sent, in the new suggestion, engines cannot handle the purpose.
2014-03-13 18:12:37	bochecha	fujiwarat: only if the panel decides to disable them, some panel implementation might decide that it's fine to let engines do their thing
2014-03-13 18:13:25	fujiwarat	bochecha: OK, I got it.
2014-03-13 18:16:08	fujiwarat	Maybe we can implement the new suggestion if the dbus methods are not sent many times.

2014-03-14 07:36:51	Lumpio-	Now I just need to get my candidate window back... I'm pretty sure it being gone isn't a feature
2014-03-14 07:37:55	Lumpio-	The "panel" thing just seems like extra noise, I'd rather not have stuff disappear and appear unless it has to
2014-03-14 07:38:08	Lumpio-	And typing is such a reflex for most people they can probably tell what mode they're in without it.
2014-03-14 07:41:13	Lumpio-	hm, although the menu in that panel was kind of nice. Can't the tray icon have that menu instead?

2014-03-15 13:49:19	ESphynx	hey guys, is ibus the default on Trusty Tahr?
2014-03-15 13:50:11	ESphynx	I was getting this annoying thing whereas calling XSetICValues with XNSpotLocation for XNPreeditAttributes was mixing up the characters I was typing if there was a lag in my app to process the following characters
2014-03-15 13:50:29	ESphynx	So I'd type "(Window and end up with something like "(Wwonid" or similar
2014-03-15 13:51:00	ESphynx	I selected xim in my ~/.xinputrc and everything is now fine :)
2014-03-15 13:56:12	ESphynx	confirmed when I explicitly select ibus I get that problem :P
2014-03-15 14:00:26	jwang	I've problem with ibus on ubuntu12.04.
2014-03-15 14:00:50	jwang	On Precise pangolin
2014-03-15 14:02:54	jwang	How to set IME setting(with ibus-pinyin - the chinese IME) to default when I log on Root User?
2014-03-15 14:04:54	jwang	I've been configure that, but It doesn't work.
2014-03-15 14:05:26	jwang	I've done that according to the normal operation.
2014-03-15 14:06:02	ESphynx	Filed issue https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1697
2014-03-15 14:07:25	jwang	<ESphynx>:thanks
2014-03-15 14:07:48	ESphynx	jwang: I don't think that relates to your issue though :P
2014-03-15 14:08:02	ESphynx	that's the issue I am having :)
2014-03-15 14:08:12	jwang	No
2014-03-15 14:08:15	jwang	I mean
2014-03-15 14:08:37	jwang	Let's me look.
2014-03-15 14:10:04	jwang	When the ibus will be stable? What do you think?
2014-03-15 14:10:39	jwang	You use Trusty Tahr right?
2014-03-15 14:10:43	ESphynx	jwang: hehe I don't know, I just learned about ibus finding it was the cause of my problem :P
2014-03-15 14:10:44	ESphynx	yes
2014-03-15 14:11:04	jwang	When?
2014-03-15 14:11:09	ESphynx	when what?
2014-03-15 14:11:15	jwang	I mean
2014-03-15 14:11:36	ESphynx	jwang are you a developer?
2014-03-15 14:11:50	jwang	yeah
2014-03-15 14:12:02	ESphynx	cool, what do you program in?
2014-03-15 14:12:20	jwang	I'm newbie in linux.
2014-03-15 14:12:32	jwang	But now I'm interested in ubuntu.
2014-03-15 14:12:35	ESphynx	ah nice.
2014-03-15 14:13:15	jwang	Wait
2014-03-15 14:24:06	lewtds	ESphynx: your issue is quite hard to understand
2014-03-15 14:24:59	lewtds	so ur building a new toolkit that talks to X directly for input methods?
2014-03-15 14:26:32	ESphynx	lewtds: well it's hardly new, but yes it's our own toolkit
2014-03-15 14:27:11	ESphynx	and it's built directly on top of Xlib
2014-03-15 14:27:51	ESphynx	lewtds: https://github.com/ecere/ecere-sdk/blob/master/ecere/src/gui/drivers/XInterface.ec -- this is our X11 driver
2014-03-15 14:28:16	ESphynx	If I comment out line 3268 ( https://github.com/ecere/ecere-sdk/blob/master/ecere/src/gui/drivers/XInterface.ec#L3268 ) the problem does not happen
2014-03-15 14:28:34	ESphynx	the problem of course does not happen if I don't bother creating an XIC at all, and the problem doesn't happen with xim
2014-03-15 14:29:08	lewtds	You should update the bug report with this info
2014-03-15 14:29:12	ESphynx	and as I type (Window there's a little lag on the '(' in this huge source file, because I haven't threaded nor optimized the code parser yet ...
2014-03-15 14:29:17	ESphynx	and Window ends up all mixed up
2014-03-15 14:29:26	ESphynx	I thought I put all that there quite clearly :P
2014-03-15 14:30:31	ESphynx	added that verbatim.
2014-03-15 14:31:06	lewtds	easier to understand now :)
2014-03-15 14:31:11	ESphynx	good :)
2014-03-15 14:35:32	ESphynx	thanks for taking a look lewtds :) good luck with a fix, it'd be nice to have this fixed for the LTS :P
2014-03-15 14:35:40	lewtds	I'm not an IBus dev but I suspect it has something to do with either your toolkit or ibus' X11 input context not following the protocol
2014-03-15 14:35:50	lewtds	here's that part
2014-03-15 14:35:51	lewtds	https://github.com/ibus/ibus/blob/master/client/x11/main.c
2014-03-15 14:37:25	ESphynx	yeah X11 gets tricky :\
2014-03-15 14:38:34	ESphynx	I don't know if it has something to do with _use_sync_mode  ?
2014-03-15 14:38:42	ESphynx	"IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE"
2014-03-15 14:39:48	lewtds	that's one clue
2014-03-15 14:40:06	lewtds	try starting ibus with IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=0 :-?
2014-03-15 14:40:41	ESphynx	yeah I wouldn't know how to do that making sure it's set
2014-03-15 14:41:22	lewtds	ping rtcm, dueno
2014-03-15 14:41:40	ESphynx	they may be sleeping :P
2014-03-15 14:42:00	bochecha	or, it's Saturday and they don't work on the week-end ;)
2014-03-15 14:42:01	lewtds	may be this will do: IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=0 ibus-daemon --xim --replace --verbose
2014-03-15 14:42:03	ESphynx	my bug report is quite clear now? ;)
2014-03-15 14:42:21	ESphynx	I can try that
2014-03-15 14:42:43	ESphynx	but my work around is to just use xim :P
2014-03-15 14:42:56	ESphynx	of course I'd like to know if my toolkit is to blame but somehow I doubt it...
2014-03-15 14:43:27	lewtds	btw, what did you set exactly in ~/.xinputrc?
2014-03-15 14:46:25	ESphynx	I use im-config
2014-03-15 14:46:47	ESphynx	and well I just reset it as I couldn't reproduce the problem with your command there
2014-03-15 14:46:58	ESphynx	with either =0 or =1, so I reset ~/.xinputrc to run_im ibus
2014-03-15 14:47:00	ESphynx	instead of xim
2014-03-15 14:47:17	ESphynx	now I can reproduce the problem, and going to try that command again
2014-03-15 14:47:24	ESphynx	what does --xim do ?
2014-03-15 14:48:02	lewtds	it makes IBus become an XIM server
2014-03-15 14:49:34	lewtds	I'm not really sure about it but it looks like in a traditional XIM settings, applications will talk to X11 through the XIM protocol
2014-03-15 14:49:37	ESphynx	interesting!
2014-03-15 14:49:50	ESphynx	IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=0 ibus-daemon --xim --replace --verbose    --- This is buggy
2014-03-15 14:49:52	lewtds	then X11 will route the message to the chosen XIM server
2014-03-15 14:49:55	ESphynx	IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=1 ibus-daemon --xim --replace --verbose    --- This works
2014-03-15 14:50:00	ESphynx	IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=1 ibus-daemon --replace --verbose    --- This works fine.
2014-03-15 14:50:07	ESphynx	and so does with =0 without the --xim
2014-03-15 14:50:21	ESphynx	the only problematic one is with  IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE=0   *and*  --xim
2014-03-15 14:50:32	lewtds	so it's clear now that ibus-x11 is the one to blame
2014-03-15 14:51:35	lewtds	A fix could be as simple as to set the sync mode to be the default
2014-03-15 14:51:54	lewtds	but we need some core developer input on this one
2014-03-15 14:52:07	lewtds	would you mind updating the bug report with this new finding?
2014-03-15 14:54:22	ESphynx	lewtds: done
2014-03-15 14:54:41	lewtds	cool, now we have to wait.
2014-03-15 14:55:02	ESphynx	I was reading how the sync mode thing was breaking hangul though :P
2014-03-15 14:55:23	ESphynx	I don't understand why there would be multiple modes, it should just work :P
2014-03-15 14:57:02	ESphynx	lewtds: well, while we wait, I'll go sleep :P
2014-03-15 14:57:06	ESphynx	thanks for the assistance! :)
2014-03-15 14:57:24	lewtds	you're welcome
2014-03-15 14:57:56	ESphynx	good night :)
2014-03-15 14:58:01	lewtds	cya
2014-03-15 15:00:08	ESphynx	oh lewtds
2014-03-15 15:00:18	ESphynx	with I dont do --xim ... I imagine my XCreateIC just fails
2014-03-15 15:02:05	ESphynx	and this ibus_input_context_process_key_event_async () must be doing some funny business :P
2014-03-15 15:12:21	lewtds	idk, if you don't use --xim then X11 must route the messages to something else, probably a blank/fake XIM server

2014-03-15 21:16:06	Lumpio_	Is there any obvious reason why suggestion/candidate popups would just not show up when using ibus+mozc
2014-03-15 21:16:21	Lumpio_	ibus 1.5.6-1 to be exact
2014-03-15 21:16:35	Lumpio_	Which part exactly is responsible for showing it
2014-03-15 21:27:35	lewtds	does the preedit text show up?
2014-03-15 21:37:11	Lumpio_	Yes
2014-03-15 21:37:17	Lumpio_	Both embedded and in the extra window if set to do so
2014-03-15 21:37:24	Lumpio_	The list box just won't.
2014-03-15 22:04:01	lewtds	just with ibus-mozc?
2014-03-15 22:04:05	lewtds	have you tried ibus-anthy?
2014-03-15 22:15:19	Lumpio_	I haven't
2014-03-15 22:15:32	Lumpio_	I'll try
2014-03-15 22:18:06	Lumpio_	hmm, seems to show up with Anthy
2014-03-15 22:18:15	Lumpio_	So I guess it's got to be mozc doing something weird then.

2014-03-16 00:03:26	dueno	Lumpio_, what's your environment btw? iirc ibus-mozc renders those popups by itself using GTK, so I suspect it is losing track of cursor postion
2014-03-16 00:03:47	Lumpio_	xfce on Arch
2014-03-16 00:03:58	Lumpio_	And I tried it in a couple of GTK programs, no difference
2014-03-16 00:13:24	dueno	hm, it works fine here with xfce 4.10.1 on Debian sid
2014-03-16 00:15:32	Lumpio_	...I just re-logged in and it started working
2014-03-16 00:15:34	Lumpio_	bizarre

2014-03-19 15:34:39	fujiwarat	rtcm: I created a patch to send panel input purpose:
2014-03-19 15:34:49	fujiwarat	https://github.com/fujiwarat/ibus/commits/purpose-panel
2014-03-19 15:35:29	fujiwarat	I'm not sure if it's useful. Currently only ja IMEs provides the input mode.
2014-03-19 15:35:57	fujiwarat	The following is the test of gnome-shell:
2014-03-19 15:35:59	fujiwarat	http://fujiwara.fedorapeople.org/ibus/20140319/gnome-shell-xx-purpose-panel.patch
2014-03-19 15:39:44	bochecha	fujiwarat: the goal was that gnome-shell would completely disable IMEs on the "password" input purpose, so I don't think it matter much if "only the ja IMEs provides the input mode"
2014-03-19 15:41:02	bochecha	(which means I don't think your gnome-shell patch does the right thing, as it seems to be changing the IME input mode, if I can read it correctly)
2014-03-19 15:42:30	fujiwarat	bochecha: But how panel disable IMEs? I guess another API may be needed to disable IME by panel if input mode is not used.
2014-03-19 15:44:32	fujiwarat	bochecha: Right, probably I don't like to use input mode. I just tried the suggestion on this chat.

I've checked out their source code and found that they're only changing the symbol of a custom InputMode property, which only shows in the input panel. I was looking for a way for IMEs to change the global icon that has been registered into IBus.EngineDesc.

2014-03-22 22:39:24	lewtds	prepangolin: you shouldn't run any graphical program as root in the first place
2014-03-22 22:39:59	prepangolin	why?
2014-03-22 22:41:19	prepangolin	lewtds, plz check my detailed question on http://askubuntu.com/questions/437279/refused-to-set-ibus-keyboard-input-method-as-root
2014-03-22 22:43:14	prepangolin	Is it for security problem? I guess
2014-03-22 22:43:20	prepangolin	Right?
2014-03-22 22:45:05	lewtds	yeah, I suppose ur running an entire session as root, right?
2014-03-22 22:45:22	lewtds	have you tried running as a normal user and selective start apps as roots
2014-03-22 22:45:27	lewtds	?
2014-03-22 22:45:29	prepangolin	Yes
2014-03-22 22:45:32	lewtds	e.g. sudo gedit
2014-03-22 22:45:34	prepangolin	root user
2014-03-22 22:45:36	prepangolin	no
2014-03-22 22:46:04	prepangolin	I logged in root user.
2014-03-22 22:46:11	lewtds	I'm running ubuntu 14.04 and can use ibus just fine if I run 'sudo gedit'.
2014-03-22 22:46:43	prepangolin	You checked my question on askubuntu?
2014-03-22 22:47:23	lewtds	yes, but it's not really clear for me.
2014-03-22 22:47:44	prepangolin	Especially where?
2014-03-22 22:48:01	prepangolin	Please explain some more.
2014-03-22 22:49:47	prepangolin	As root suer, I tried only use system-setting/language support to set ibus.
2014-03-22 22:50:13	prepangolin	But It didn't.
2014-03-22 22:50:52	lewtds	this is likely to be a Ubuntu-specific bug
2014-03-22 22:50:59	lewtds	if you REALLY want to run a root session
2014-03-22 22:51:04	prepangolin	you mean
2014-03-22 22:51:18	prepangolin	It's specific to ubuntu
2014-03-22 22:51:29	prepangolin	yes
2014-03-22 22:51:33	lewtds	then you can manually set some environment variables to make ibus work
2014-03-22 22:51:38	lewtds	in ~/.profile
2014-03-22 22:51:47	lewtds	GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
2014-03-22 22:51:48	prepangolin	yes
2014-03-22 22:51:53	prepangolin	yes
2014-03-22 22:51:53	lewtds	QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
2014-03-22 22:51:58	lewtds	QT4_IM_MODULE=ibus
2014-03-22 22:52:32	prepangolin	ok
2014-03-22 22:52:33	lewtds	XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
2014-03-22 22:52:51	lewtds	each line should be prepended with "export"
2014-03-22 22:53:18	prepangolin	I'll take it
2014-03-22 22:53:21	lewtds	I guess that ibus-daemon is not autostarted as the root user as well
2014-03-22 22:53:52	prepangolin	That's right.
2014-03-22 22:53:58	lewtds	so you also need to run "ibus-daemon --xim --replace --daemon" somewhere after login
2014-03-22 22:54:36	prepangolin	But then I wonder ibus-daemon is not autostarted as the root user as well.
2014-03-22 22:54:48	prepangolin	Do you have idea?
2014-03-22 22:54:53	lewtds	usually, in Ubuntu, ibus-daemon is started by xinit
2014-03-22 22:55:01	prepangolin	yes
2014-03-22 22:55:33	prepangolin	Why ibus-daemon start only by non-root user?
2014-03-22 22:55:45	lewtds	looking at your askubuntu.com question, I guess that there is something wrong with xinit and the root user
2014-03-22 22:56:41	prepangolin	Especially, I found the some interesting data in "im-switch".
2014-03-22 22:57:04	lewtds	but then, as I said, running a root session is wildly dangerous and unsupported
2014-03-22 22:57:14	lewtds	anything might break
2014-03-22 22:57:17	prepangolin	You are right.
2014-03-22 22:57:27	prepangolin	You mean
2014-03-22 22:58:08	prepangolin	ibus is the one factor on security problem.
2014-03-22 22:58:11	prepangolin	right?
2014-03-22 22:58:35	lewtds	I don't know. I'm not an IBus dev, nor am I a security expert.
2014-03-22 22:58:47	prepangolin	btw, i'll show you the message.
2014-03-22 22:59:00	prepangolin	maybe it's interesting.
2014-03-22 22:59:32	prepangolin	"No private configuration can be defined for root account."
2014-03-22 22:59:58	prepangolin	I found it in im-switch.
2014-03-22 23:00:36	prepangolin	In there, If user is root then print that message.
2014-03-22 23:03:48	prepangolin	Hi
2014-03-22 23:04:05	prepangolin	What's the matter?
2014-03-22 23:04:23	prepangolin	Are u busy now.
2014-03-22 23:04:33	lewtds	maybe it has something to do with DBus session and the root account
2014-03-22 23:05:38	-->	kiranps (~kiran@117.209.205.222) has joined #ibus
2014-03-22 23:05:48	prepangolin	Did you check im-switch code.
2014-03-22 23:06:18	lewtds	I'm reading it
2014-03-22 23:11:25	lewtds	I think the problem is at line 245 @ im-switch.in
2014-03-22 23:12:53	lewtds	 /usr/sbin/update-alternatives --set xinput-$LNG $XINPUT_PATH/${1}
2014-03-22 23:13:34	lewtds	in your askubuntu question, I can see this error message from that line:
2014-03-22 23:13:35	lewtds	update-alternatives: error: alternative /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ibus for xinput-all_ALL not registered, not setting.
2014-03-22 23:14:03	lewtds	this could be the answer: http://askubuntu.com/questions/50540/what-is-ubuntus-definition-of-a-registered-application
2014-03-22 23:15:48	lewtds	wait, can you check that the file /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ibus actually exists?
2014-03-22 23:16:14	prepangolin	Let me see.
2014-03-22 23:16:57	prepangolin	Sure
2014-03-22 23:17:13	prepangolin	It exists.
2014-03-22 23:18:44	prepangolin	?
2014-03-22 23:20:30	lewtds	this issue is pretty deep and I'm afraid I can't help you further. The environment vars method I mentioned above should just work.
2014-03-22 23:21:34	lewtds	after all, the im-switch script is just a fancy way to set these vars and start ibus-daemon
2014-03-22 23:22:03	prepangolin	Thx for your help
2014-03-22 23:22:21	prepangolin	Cya

2014-03-25 15:16:09	Laibsch	Hello, I upgraded from Ubuntu precise to trusty and now ibus is no longer working :-(  "ibus-daemon &" tells me the daemon is already running.  Shift-Space does not do anything.  There is also no Ibus icon under system settings.  What am I missing, I wonder? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus doesn't help me.

2014-03-25 15:16:54	Laibsch	grepping my environment variables for ibus gets me "GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus"
2014-03-25 15:17:32	anish_	Laibsch, are you using GNOME ?
2014-03-25 15:17:40	 *	bochecha was about to ask the same
2014-03-25 15:17:55	Laibsch	I am using unity
2014-03-25 15:18:26	Laibsch	I cannot find anything relevant in syslog
2014-03-25 15:18:36	 *	bochecha knows nothing about how these things work on Unity, passing...
2014-03-25 15:18:52	 *	anish_ as well 
2014-03-25 15:19:08	lewtds	Laibsch, IIRC, they now use Super-Space
2014-03-25 15:19:42	Laibsch	lewtds: won't switch it on, either :--(
2014-03-25 15:19:46	lewtds	ibus-setup does not work anymore in Unity, you have to use the Text Entry page in System Settings 
2014-03-25 15:20:19	bochecha	lewtds: do you know if they also use ibus-ui-gtk3 or did they replace it with their own things?
2014-03-25 15:20:50	lewtds	bochecha: they patch ibus-panel to show an Unity indicator
2014-03-25 15:20:57	bochecha	oh, ok
2014-03-25 15:21:05	Laibsch	thanks.  I had tried to add "Japanese" for Input sources there.  But I think that's only for the keyboard layout, not conversion.
2014-03-25 15:21:18	Laibsch	and indeed, it was only the keyboard layout, no conversion happened
2014-03-25 15:21:43	lewtds	maybe you'll need to logout/login two. Have you installed ibus-anthy?
2014-03-25 15:22:17	Laibsch	yes, that's been installed for years
2014-03-25 15:22:25	Laibsch	and I have rebooted several times since upgrading
2014-03-25 15:22:54	Laibsch	lewtds: there is no more Ibus icon in system settings for you, too?
2014-03-25 15:23:27	lewtds	in my Text Entry, there are several Japanese input sources but only the Japanese (Anthy) is the one you expect
2014-03-25 15:23:53	Laibsch	Can you upload a screenshot?
2014-03-25 15:24:14	lewtds	wait, I'm in GNOME. I need to login to Unity

2014-03-25 15:30:02	Laibsch	やった！

2014-03-25 15:30:14	Laibsch	thanks again
2014-03-25 15:30:48	lewtds	ur welcomed
2014-03-25 15:30:50	Laibsch	sounds like a bad UI decision on Unity's part, but as long as Japanese input works now.

2014-03-25 16:11:15	lewtds	is it implemented in GNOME shell's source?

2014-03-27 18:03:16	fujiwarat	rtcm: Probably I will add an API for panel to change IME state for password mode.

2014-03-27 18:03:34	fujiwarat	http://fujiwara.fedorapeople.org/ibus/20140319/gnome-shell-xx-purpose-panel.patch
2014-03-27 18:04:24	bochecha	.me doesn't understand why notifying the panel/shell isn't enough
2014-03-27 18:04:58	bochecha	and then the panel/shell could just decide to 1. force-switch the user to a keyboard layout and 2. prevent the user from switching back to an input method
2014-03-27 18:06:11	fujiwarat	I think it would need to convert IBusEngineDesc.layout in the IME to IBusEngineDesc.name for xkb.
2014-03-27 18:08:41	fujiwarat	It means how to get the current xkb name.
2014-03-27 18:10:22	bochecha	fujiwarat: that's not what I meant
2014-03-27 18:10:42	bochecha	say the user has two configured input sources: the en(US) keyboard layout and a Japanese IME
2014-03-27 18:11:09	bochecha	when focusing a password entry, the panel/shell would automatically switch the user to the en_US) keyboard layout, even if the user was using the Japanese IME
2014-03-27 18:11:34	bochecha	if I have the fr(oss) keyboard layout and the Cangjie IME configured, then the panel/shell should force-switch me to the fr(oss) keyboard layout
2014-03-27 18:12:38	fujiwarat	bochecha: However someone don't need xkb engine. Just one IME would be enough.
2014-03-27 18:12:48	bochecha	not on GNOME
2014-03-27 18:12:58	bochecha	you have to have a non IME input source on GNOME iirc
2014-03-27 18:13:19	bochecha	on other desktops, well it would be up to the panel/shell used on these desktops to choose what to do :)
2014-03-27 18:13:56	bochecha	but I don't think falling back to the underlying layout of the IME makes sense
2014-03-27 18:14:16	fujiwarat	OK, I have to check it.
2014-03-27 18:14:39	bochecha	if I'm typing on a French keyboard and I only have the Cangjie IME configured (underlying layout is US), then I shouldn't be switched to the US layout
2014-03-27 18:14:58	bochecha	that would just make me type a password in the US layout when I think I'm typing it in the French layout
2014-03-27 18:15:09	bochecha	and as a result, I might end up not being able to input my password correctly
2014-03-27 18:15:26	fujiwarat	bochecha: If IME1, IME2, XKB1, XKB2 are configured, which XKB gnome-shell will change to in password mode?
2014-03-27 18:15:43	bochecha	the next one
2014-03-27 18:15:53	bochecha	i.e the one you'd have gotten by switching yourself
2014-03-27 18:16:25	bochecha	and if gnome-shell switches the user to XKB1 but they want XKB2, they can still switch to it
2014-03-27 18:16:34	bochecha	they just can't switch to IME1 or IME2
2014-03-27 18:17:42	fujiwarat	OK, that makes sense.
2014-03-27 18:18:57	bochecha	(to be honest, I don't think it makes any sense to let the user have only an IME and no configured xkb layout... there are cases where they'll need an xkb layout to type, like a password, or an email)
2014-03-27 18:20:28	fujiwarat	bochecha: AFAIK, CN users have XKB and IME by default but JP users have IME only in Windows.
2014-03-27 18:20:56	bochecha	JP users never need to type an email, or a url in the browser?
2014-03-27 18:22:03	fujiwarat	bochecha: I mean JP users switch IME mode instead of switching engines.
2014-03-27 18:22:24	bochecha	ah, so the IME has a mode to type as if it were an XKB layout?
2014-03-27 18:22:35	fujiwarat	bochecha: Now I tried gnome-shell on fedora 20 and I can configure one IME.
2014-03-27 18:22:37	 *	bochecha never understood what was the point of this
2014-03-27 18:23:04	fujiwarat	bochecha: Right. The mode has muti-byte and English mode.
2014-03-27 18:28:18	fujiwarat	I'm still not sure if notification only is enough. But if you're ok, the minimum patch is fine with me.
2014-03-27 18:28:47	bochecha	well, I'm really not the one to take this decision :P
2014-03-27 18:29:06	fujiwarat	ok, thx.
2014-03-27 18:29:07	bochecha	I'm just giving my opinion here, as someone who has been bitten by the problem (and was locked out of his session because of it)
2014-03-27 18:29:28	bochecha	having tried Mac OS X, their behaviour is pretty much what I described above, and I do think it makes a lot of sense
2014-03-27 18:29:37	bochecha	but the ones to decide that would be rtcm and aday I guess?
2014-03-27 18:29:54	fujiwarat	yeah

2014-03-27 18:53:47	bochecha	(or more likely: that I got lucky this time :P)
2014-03-27 18:53:59	rtcm	:_)
2014-03-27 18:54:25	rtcm	and if the user only has an IME configured, say anthy, then the shell doesn't do anything
2014-03-27 18:54:32	rtcm	and the engine will have to handle this case
2014-03-27 18:54:39	rtcm	which anthy already does today IIUC
2014-03-27 18:54:56	rtcm	so it's a pretty small change all around \o/
2014-03-27 18:55:34	bochecha	rtcm: didn't gnome prevent the user from having only an ime configured?
2014-03-27 18:55:44	bochecha	I thought it made sure to always have an xkb layout as well
2014-03-27 18:55:45	rtcm	no, it doesn't
2014-03-27 18:56:01	bochecha	ok
2014-03-27 18:56:07	bochecha	must have gotten that wrong, then :)
2014-03-27 18:56:53	bochecha	for what is worth, I'm completely uninterested in having such a "act like an xkb layout" mode to my engine
2014-03-27 18:56:58	rtcm	some users (I guess at least japanese) really prefer to just switch the engine mode
2014-03-27 18:57:14	bochecha	if the user wants to input with something that behaves like an xkb layout, then they should configure one
2014-03-27 18:57:30	rtcm	I guess it's all cargo cult from the way different IMEs work on windows :-/
2014-03-27 18:57:37	bochecha	yeah, probably
2014-03-27 18:57:55	bochecha	ther emight be a lot of "but switching between input sources is much slower than just switching the input mode!"
2014-03-27 18:58:05	bochecha	to which the answer is to make it faster, not to add input modes...
2014-03-27 18:58:55	bochecha	some users already asked me for such an input mode in ibus-cangjie, but I'm resisting... it owuld just add tons of complexity in ibus-cangjie, and would give them a crappy input experience anyway compared to just switching...

2014-04-01 21:16:09	lewtds	[15:03:34] wonder if anyone has made an APL input method?
2014-04-01 21:16:09	anish__	[15:03:59] lewtds, what is APL?
2014-04-01 21:16:09	lewtds	[15:04:36] http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10011550
2014-04-01 21:16:09	lewtds	[15:05:26] it's a really old (probably the very first) functional/array programming language that requires its own mathematic character set
2014-04-01 21:16:09	anish__	[15:06:42] aha i think there using ibus-table you can enter maths symbols
2014-04-01 21:16:09	lewtds	[15:07:21] thanks, I've never tried ibus-table before (partly because the docs are so scarce)
2014-04-01 21:16:09	lewtds	[17:14:07] Why does the ibus-table IME always input numbers as CJK full-width chars instead of the normal one with my custom table?
