2021-03-07 14:01:29	tinsoldier	[15:17:02] ice — Old English "is" "ice, piece of ice" (also the name of the Anglo-Saxon rune for "-i-"), from Proto-Germanic "*is-" "ice" (source also of Old Norse "iss", Old Frisian "is", Dutch "ijs", German "Eis"), of uncertain origin; possible relatives are Avestan "aexa-" "frost, ice," "isu-" "frosty, icy;" Afghan "asai" "frost." Slang meaning "diamonds" is attested from 1906. Modern spelling...

2021-03-07 14:01:29	OMGOMG_	[17:04:01] rey: "referring to"

2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:12] hi
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:19] Can we plan a call to discuss the role?
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:23] is that correct? ^
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[18:05:25] it's fine thojanssens1 
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[18:06:14] thank you
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[18:44:17] if you have a tree of companies owning one another, what's the "top company" called?
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[18:44:20] like the parent of all of them
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:45:46] I guess maybe "root" is the appropriate term if we're speaking of a "tree" of companies? Otherwise, the generic term "parent company," which you mentioned, is fine too.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:46:47] good morning does this sound wrong "Accelerate your journey for having higher returning customers"
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:48:10] Accelerate your journey for having higher rate returning customers
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:49:01] Accelerate your journey to higher rate of returning customers
2021-03-07 14:01:29	darsie	[18:50:45] The root is typically at the bottom of a tree.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:51:04] Well, that's the physical location, but it "feeds" the rest of the tree, and is in a way in charge of all of it.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:51:21] Like the top company would be.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:53:46] nah, roots are usually at the top
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:01] most trees, except for the biological ones, grow down
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:54:27] I mean, I guess it depends on your frame of reference, but most people think the ground, and hence the earth or soil is the "bottom."
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:54:36] And the uppermost branches are the "top."
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:47] yeah, for those kinds of treesz
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:54] but for example binary trees grow down
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:55:16] ... "Binary" trees? I mean natural, living trees here. Not some discrete math construct.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:55:26] trees are trees :)
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:55:39] I guess you mean some graph theory thing.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[19:05:26] Biological trees are the only kind that matter >:)
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:04] raccoon_dog: if A owns B and B owns C, the parent of C would be B tho
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:11] so I think "parent" isn't clear enough
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:16] I guess root is one term
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[19:06:20] Right, I see.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[19:07:07] In more technical terms, the relationship isn't transitive. So parenthood indeed won't apply.

2021-03-07 14:01:29	tinsoldier	[20:20:19] hearable — Adjective: 1. That can be heard; audible https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hearable
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[20:21:20] why would anyone say "hearable" when they could just say "audible"
2021-03-07 14:01:29	ksft	[20:21:34] I would not
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[20:28:17] Neither would I and I would beg someone to never say "hearable" ever.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:34:24] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webscrapbook/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search : "Capture web pages to local device or backend server for future retrieval, organization, annotation, and edit." <-- What does mean "to capture" web pages? Does it mean to copy them locally or what?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:34:43] yeah, "store", probably
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:35:07] usually the browser just keeps them in memory
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:36:35] ksft, I doubt that it means to "store". I believe, the oriinal will be kept intact in this procedure.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:37:10] isn't that what storage is?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:37:36] no. storage means a transfer from one place to another.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:37:59] it does not
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:38:15] at least in common usage.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:38:33] are you a native speaker?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:38:46] no, I'm not.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:39:16] "store" doesn't mean any sort of transfer
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:39:30] you could put something into storage, and you might call that storing it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:40:08] and that's actually what I meant, but "store" can also mean 'keep in storage without moving'
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:40:34] bullgard4: in this case "to capture" means "to save a copy of"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:42:17] I agree with your message: "<ksft> "store" doesn't mean any sort of transer."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:42:37] MetaNova, thank you for commenting.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:43:33] ksft, The point is what will happen with the original object that is "stored".
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:44:05] ksft, The point is what will happen with the original object that is "captured".
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:44:09] as the plugin description indicates, the stored copies are for the purposes of future retrieval, organization, annotation, and editing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:10] well information is fundamentally different from physical objects
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:27] "storing" or "capturing" information doesn't do anything to the original
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:35] it involves copying it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:52] storing or capturing a physical object would involve taking it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:45:58] MetaNova, Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:48:25] MetaNova, I've got a supplemental question: Why did the author of this add-on use the word "to capture" and not "to copy"?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:49:59] it's a fairly common term in computing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:50:34] but 'copy' is even more common.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:50:45] to capture (particularly websites) means to make a standalone copy of something as it exists at that time - implying it has/will often change
2021-03-07 14:01:30	LuisM18	[20:50:50] pages being dynamic, current state of it being captured
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:51:18] Ah! Understood. - Thank you.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:51:33] and without context, "copy" can be confusing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:51:59] if I were to say "I copied this website" it could easily be interpreted to mean that I mimicked it/outright stole it's format/layout/content for my own purposes
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:52:11] if I were to say "I captured this website" there is far less ambiguity
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:52:26] I see.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:53:06] (admittedly it is also less ambiguous if I were to say, "I made a copy of this website")
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:54:05] ok

2021-03-07 14:01:30	Neo444	[21:02:43] why?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bin_bash	[21:03:03] It's rude, unnecessary, and drama-inducing.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Neo444	[21:03:07] Do you know who I am?

2021-03-07 14:01:30	LuisM18	[21:03:35] does it matter?

2021-03-07 14:01:30	bin_bash	[21:03:50] nope that's why it was a funny response

2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:08:31] is "don't let's" an old way of saying "let's not"?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:15:31] tonta666: Old and/or dialectical.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:18:22] thanks, i was reading narnia so probably the first :P
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:22:23] I heard it in a mid 80s music video
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:24:16]  I am -0 on this atm.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:24:20] what does "-0" mean?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:25:05] I'm not sure it has any meaning outside of context
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:14] Hah, I remember discussing this here.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:19] I think hoglahoo was here for that.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:25:33] yeah, I brought it up because I had just heard it in that music video :)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:33] (Re: "don't let's.")
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:26:49] there's another phrase in it by the same speaker I don't understand.  I'm treating it like a puzzle though, so I don't want help yet
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:29:04] can you share it if we promise not to answer?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:29:45] channel's too big, some schmuck would ruin it!
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:30:14] at some point I'll bring it back up whether I gave up or figured it out
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:30:31] true
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Samian	[05:30:59]  Agree or disagree?   analysis == breaking a whole into its parts (forest to trees). Synthesis == combining parts to form a whole picture (trees to forest).   
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:31:20] amosbird: There are voting systems where people ofter a +1 (let's do this) or a -1 (I am against doing this)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:31:52] amosbird: A playful extension are +0 "We might as well" and -0 "Why bother"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:32:10] And then there's +1000000000000000000000000000000000
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Samian	[05:33:38] I don't think there's a word that means to do both analyze and synthesize. Doesn't the lay meaning of "analyze" encompasses synthesis too? while the more technical meaning of analyze does not?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:35:34] papna: thanks!
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:40:28] tonta666: eh I guess I give up.  I think he's saying "I don't want to be piss bored about with you" at around 0:10, but I'm not totally sure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0sr0ZnUc7I
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:41:20] the "don't let's" is there at the beginning, too, fwiw
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:45:39] hm, let me see
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:45:52] sounds like "pissballed" to me
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:46:18] "i don't wanna be pissballed of that with you"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:47:59] (not that i know what it means)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:28] pissed on by that with you
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:52] or pissed bored of that
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:57] I think piss bored
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:50:26] piss bored is a thing actually said, I have never heard of pissballed heh
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:50:37] yeah, I've heard and read "piss bored"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:50:48] not too sure about "bored about with..."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:50:52] But that's not my native dialect... so get an expert for the final word.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:52:09] not mine either but i hear an L rather than an R
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:52:30] I can see how it sounds like that, tonta666, but my ear doesn't really go that direction here
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:52:41] "I don't want to be piss bored of that with you" makes perfect sense in context 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:53:16] does it? doesn't "piss bored" just mean really bored?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:53:33] tonta666: Perhaps bored to anger in this sense ?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:53:42] he's tired of getting the runaround from her
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:07] I don't know.  This is turning into yanny/laurel 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:19] Dang compression artifacts :) 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:54:25] lol
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:54:32] or maybe it's "piss bald" because he's malding
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:51] oh
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:54:55] That thing is creepy. I remember when I could make myself hear "yanny" or "laurel" depending on I'd thought of.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:55:05] And it gave me the creeps in this really visceral way.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:55:18] s/on I'd/on what I'd
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tinsoldier	[05:55:18] r​accoon_dog meant: That thing is creepy. I remember when I could make myself hear "yanny" or "laurel" depending on what I'd thought of.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:55:31] Heh. I can do with with some optical illusions, and it can be unsettling. 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:57:13] piss-ball around 	Verb. To idle away time, to mess around. E.g."Isn't it about time you did some work, as you've been piss-balling around all morning."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:57:31] from http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/english-slang/p.htm
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:05] Hm, I prefer that interpretation then if we hav a cite for the term
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:58:08] okay
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:10] That has to be British slang or something because I've never heard that in my life.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:24] I couldn't find it, that's the meaning I guessed it would have if it existed, heh.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:25] I guess we could ask blk shp when he's active.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:58:28] sade is from scotland iirc?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:58:32] or england?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:37] !w sade
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tinsoldier	[05:58:38] sade — Noun: 1. Alternative spelling of sadhe, — Verb: 1. (dialect) To tire, weary. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sade
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:41] It's absolutely British, exclusively.  Piss is rarely used like that at all in North American English. 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:58:51] I'm not sure it matters where she's from since she isn't the speaker
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:01] And he has a British accent :p 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:28] Oh, is "sade" a person here?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:32] I should not say exclusively.  Sorry Australia.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:35] The lack of capitalization threw me off.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:38] Sade is the woman in the video, a musician.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:45] ... Yeah, that's "Sade."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:59:46] man, if it's piss-balled I'm going to be upset with myself
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:55] I think it is
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[06:00:06] Hey, it's what I heard, and understood but was like "is that really a word?" 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[06:00:16] And went on a wild goose chase :)

2021-03-07 14:04:47	hoglahoo	tomorrow?  don't let's waste any time, lucky
2021-03-07 14:05:20	tonta666	that would make the most sense but i'm torn between it and "...pissballed of that with you"

2021-03-07 14:08:37	lucky	raccoon_dog: It's a short skit before the video to set the context, and it's a spoken dialogue at a police station or similar 
2021-03-07 14:08:52	raccoon_dog	Oh, I see.
2021-03-07 14:09:09	raccoon_dog	I was scrolling up for the URL. I couldn't seem to find it.
2021-03-07 14:09:12	 *	raccoon_dog shrugs.
2021-03-07 14:09:15	hoglahoo	if you can find the script that works too

2021-03-07 14:09:41	raccoon_dog	Well, I mean, that's usually kept by the studio, unless they release it publicly; either that, or it's leaked.
2021-03-07 14:10:04	raccoon_dog	Also -- since this is a short skit, it may be improvised?
2021-03-07 14:10:06	lucky	A scene like that would have been shot probably with no script
2021-03-07 14:10:07	hoglahoo	what you just said doesn't really impact my desire to search for it on google one way or another
2021-03-07 14:10:09	lucky	it's 15 seconds
2021-03-07 14:10:18	raccoon_dog	Yeah, see. Improvised.
2021-03-07 14:10:19	hoglahoo	well, it continues on after the song
2021-03-07 14:10:26	lucky	Oh, never mind then.
2021-03-07 14:10:30	hoglahoo	not that particular scene, but I mean the story
2021-03-07 14:10:38	hoglahoo	and is interspersed during the song, too

2021-03-07 15:52:07	drbean-	I don't remember the name of the book in which Halliday (and a co-author?) make English out to be a topic-comment language, but the title of this article of his perhaps gives you an idea of his argument: ' It's a fixed word order language is English.'
2021-03-07 15:53:47	drbean-	That's not grammatical. More correct would be: ' It's a fixed word order language, English is.
2021-03-07 15:54:16	drbean-	drbean, why would that be more correct?

2021-03-07 16:05:00	drbean-	Perhaps I was overstating Halliday's position. He may have just been showing the resources English has for structuring topics.
2021-03-07 16:05:14	huf_	or maybe I'm totally off about the whole thing
2021-03-07 16:06:33	huf_	somewhere on wiki .hu is described as a topic-prominent language IIRC

2021-03-07 16:09:10	huf_	no
2021-03-07 16:09:27	huf_	it's uralic, the second most populous language family in europe
2021-03-07 16:09:49	huf_	after that, you just have the weirdness in the caucasus and basque
2021-03-07 16:09:57	huf_	oh wait, and a couple of others
2021-03-07 16:10:17	huf_	there's definitely some semitic in there
2021-03-07 16:10:47	drbean-	What are the languages in the uralic group?
2021-03-07 16:10:59	huf_	finnish, estonian, .hu, like a dozen small languages in russia
2021-03-07 16:11:13	huf_	saami?
2021-03-07 16:11:28	drbean-	Russian is not a uralic language? It's Indo-European?
2021-03-07 16:11:28	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:11:31	huf_	yes
2021-03-07 16:14:15	drbean-	In Japanese they have a special particle for topics and another one for subjects
2021-03-07 16:15:17	drbean-	So, I'm visiting a Japanese university and I go in and meet some profs with Dr Lee from Hong Kong University. Lee doesn't speak any Japanese. I do all the talking.
2021-03-07 16:15:56	drbean-	I introduce Lee. I say in Japanese, 'This is Dr Lee from Hong Kong University'.
2021-03-07 16:16:57	drbean-	OK. In a different scenario, Lee is not there when I meet the profs.
2021-03-07 16:17:37	drbean-	But I'm talking about Lee with the profs. Lee walks in. I say in Japanese. 'This is Dr Lee.'
2021-03-07 16:18:07	drbean-	The form of the 'this' in the 2 sentences is different.
2021-03-07 16:18:26	drbean-	Inscrutable, no?
2021-03-07 16:19:46	drbean-	In the first case, 'this' has the topic particle after it. Lee is the topic. In the second case, 'this' has the subject particle after it. Lee is not the topic.
2021-03-07 16:20:00	drbean-	Inscrutable, no?
2021-03-07 16:22:11	drbean-	Actually, Lee is not the topic. 'this' is the topic in the first case, because Lee is in the room, and everyone is aware of him being there, so 'this person' is a given.
2021-03-07 16:23:40	drbean-	In the second case, Lee walks in. It's a novel situation. 'this person' is new, not part of the topic.
2021-03-07 16:23:59	drbean-	That's the theory of the Japanese, anyway, apparently.
2021-03-07 16:24:37	drbean-	Don't you see some parallels between this situation and the use in English of the in/definite articles.
2021-03-07 16:26:17	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:26:29	huf_	the "rules" are batshit and you just have to learn to feel what's correct :)
2021-03-07 16:27:11	drbean-	'the' for things which are given, like 'wa' for topics in Japanese, with Lee's presence a given. And 'a' for new things, like 'ga' for new things, when Lee walks in.

2021-03-07 16:32:43	huf_	in every specific case, we can immediately tell what article is correct

2021-03-07 16:33:42	drbean-	I read in an American ESL textbook: A: I'm thinking of buying a wide-screen TV. B: I've seen those in the store.
2021-03-07 16:33:57	drbean-	"The store"?
2021-03-07 16:34:10	drbean-	There's only one store?
2021-03-07 16:34:14	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:34:17	huf_	the one you saw it at
2021-03-07 16:34:33	huf_	:D
2021-03-07 16:35:29	drbean-	There are many stores. A doesn't know which store B is talking about. B is not talking about any particular store.
2021-03-07 16:35:45	drbean-	They mean they've seen them in stores.
2021-03-07 16:35:58	huf_	might not have seen them in multiple stores
2021-03-07 16:36:43	huf_	it's like "let's go down to the beach"
2021-03-07 16:37:54	drbean-	That's a new one on me. 'the beach'. But it doesn't mean any particular beach. It means 'a' beach.
2021-03-07 16:38:04	huf_	no, it means the beach where we're going
2021-03-07 16:38:17	huf_	the default one
2021-03-07 16:39:48	drbean-	What about 'the hospital' in AmE and 'hospital' in BrE. Do they mean different things in the US and UK?
2021-03-07 16:39:55	huf_	no
2021-03-07 16:40:06	huf_	what you have to realize is that to a large extent, all this is arbitrary
2021-03-07 16:40:33	huf_	why do you say "I saw the cat" but not "I saw the Gerald"?
2021-03-07 16:41:07	drbean-	Names and nouns are different things.
2021-03-07 16:41:12	huf_	apparently
2021-03-07 16:41:32	huf_	but not necessarily though. in Budapest Hungarian, you'd put the definite article before names too
2021-03-07 16:41:48	huf_	can be done either way
2021-03-07 16:41:52	huf_	English went with this scheme

2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:31:40] what exactly does it mean when I see a word followed by "-backed"?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:34:09] Please provide context.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:37:52] papna: for example, "here our efforts to counter government-backed attacks".
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:38:34] marshmallow: X is Y-backed = X is backed by Y, for whichever gloss of "back" is intended
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:38:52] but what "backed" means here?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:39:03] marshmallow: This means that the government supported the attacks.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:39:06] does it mean "supported"?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:39:10] in that context, supported or promoted
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:39:24] so, governments are supported attacks?

2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:39:46] marshmallow: No, the government provided support for the attacks.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:39:50] marshmallow: are supportING THOSE attacks
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:40:13] yep, sorry I meant supporting, my bad
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:40:35] ok fine. so "to back" can be used as a synonym of "to support" ?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:40:38] Yes, it means the government is supporting the attacks they are talking about
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:41:03] You can buy adhesive-backed wall-paper; the logic is the same but the meaning is very different
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:42:05] marshmallow: Yes, that is one meaning of back. See entry 4 in the dictionary page I linked.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:42:13] ok thanks!
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:46:22] marshmallow: a native speaker who doesn't know a word or phrase would generally ask a question along the lines of: «What does "X Y Z" mean?»
2021-03-20 11:49:21	marshmallow	[14:47:11] kurahaupo: is "what exactly does it mean when I see [...]" wrong?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:47:29] that's also fine
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:48:14] But putting the quoted phrase in the middle of your question is exactly right
2021-03-20 11:49:21	kurahaupo	[14:53:29] It's kinda strange that this isn't taught directly in ESOL classes, since it's probably the question that learners will need most often. As a result, I often hear people who've become quite competent at conversational English, but give themselves away by using a stilted phrasing for that question.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[14:55:24] "What exactly does it mean when I see _____?" does not sound stilted or unnatural to me.

2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:20:10] All the Finnish vowel names are just that vowel in long
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:20:12] possibly related to me reading sentence like "in 1992, hats became larger" as "in ezerkilencszázkilencvenkilenc, hats became larger"

2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:20:50] we do, but the alphabet is somewhat less weird here
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[16:21:02] just longer.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:21:10] I think the only weirdos are ly and y
2021-03-20 11:49:21	LuisM14	[16:21:16] referring to english
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:21:24] well no, q and x are also weird
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[16:21:47] darsie: There's a different use, too: young children are told to act like 'big boys' and 'big girls' -- thus, sometimes 'big girl' is used metaphorically sometimes to refer to maturity.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:22:09] do people say big little girl?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:22:14] yes
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:22:17] because I've heard the equivalent a few times and it's just
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:22:18] awful
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:22:21] _awful_
2021-03-20 11:49:21	papna	[16:22:29] I read it Guy-torus.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:22:35] To be fair “big” has enough meanings that the original question is effectively meaningless
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:22:47] Which is why I didn't respond to it to be honest
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:23:00] nalkri: do the finnish long/short vowel pairs really match up?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:23:09] or have some of the pairs drifted apart in pronunciation
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:23:31] They're the same vowels
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:23:46] is it conceptualized as two vs one vowel then?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:23:55] At least in the “standard” dialects, obviously individuals do weird shit
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[16:23:55] GweeTorree
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:24:01] cos it cant be the *same* if one's long and the other is short
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:24:02] No as long vs short
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:24:17] ah, but same quality
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:24:41] that makes things neater
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:25:07] our a/á and e/é have drifted quite far apart so we cant keep up that illusion 
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[16:25:23] Same quality, different length
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:25:28] they function as each others pair, but they dont sound like it :D
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:26:37] of course, it's all illusion
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:26:50] in reality we have some "secret" vowels that we arent taught about in school
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:26:56] like au and a short á
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[16:28:25] I guess the goal is to keep the curriculum simple rather than correct :)
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:03:58] could someone tell me.. is it “During his nearly two-decards-long career, he…” or “Durinig his nearly two-decade-long career, he…”

2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:11:29] It's "During"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	TimMc	[17:12:03] yoshie902a: I don't feel like there's much of a difference between the two.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:12:46] hoglahoo: typo… the question was two-decade-long vs two-decades-long
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:13:18] one is correct and the there is not, but not sure which
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:15:33] I dont know for sure, and I agree with TimMc with the feeling that the meaning is the same, but I for correctness I lean toward two-decade-long over two-decades-long
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:16:40] just as you'd say a 5 inch pencil, not a 5 inches pencil.  modifier versus standalone
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[17:18:04] 2 decade career / 2 decade long career / 2 decades long career (just not '2 decades career')
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[17:18:31] I prefer either the last or "20 year career"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:19:06] how about 20 years long career?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[17:22:01] Well i think both require a complete sentence.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:22:58] do two-decades-long career is preferred?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:23:05] do = so
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[17:23:22] To me, yes.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:24:19] hoglahoo: is there a formal reason two-decade-long would be better?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:24:34] sorry, I don't know
2021-03-20 11:49:21	yoshie902a	[17:24:53] so back to where I started. thank you
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:25:50] no problem.  I'm interested in knowing an answer to that if you find one

2021-03-20 11:49:21	bin_bash	[17:31:05] I was going to ask why not say the number of years
2021-03-20 11:49:21	bin_bash	[17:31:17] if it's not 2 decades, why not say 18-year career or whatever
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:32:20] because they said this, I assume it's some kind of test or assignment: <yoshie902a> one is correct and the there is not, but not sure which
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[17:32:31] I debate that
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:32:51] not yet; it takes two to debate!
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:33:07] meh, I guess it doesn't.  well anyways...
2021-03-20 11:49:21	TimMc	[17:49:11] I wonder why "18 years long career" sounds wrong to me but "2 decades long career" doesn't.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	TimMc	[17:49:26] I agree that using the singular is probably the safer bet.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:51:41] Both sound wrong to me.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[17:54:23] is there anyone here who prefers "years" or "decades" there and is a native speaker?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	 *	xiuxing [17:55:03] is interested.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[17:55:55] I don't know of any variants that allow plurals in noun adjuncts
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:56:41] I just learned they have to be singular.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:56:59] without knowing why
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[17:57:20] what sort of 
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[17:57:27] what sort of "why" are you looking for?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[17:58:02] to me it sounds the same as "five-dollar burger" versus "five-dollars burger"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:58:05] "Why do they have to be singular when modifying nouns"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[17:58:15] because that's how it be
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:58:23] hoglahoo: exactly
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[17:58:25] grammar is made up :D
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[17:58:31] but it's super serious
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[17:59:18] five-dollarS sounds like ending a sentence to me.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:00:13] so five-dollar sounds like it can be followed by a noun
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:00:44] It's my feeling as a learner of English.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:00:55] yeah, it sounds okay to me when used like an adjective.  not so sure about the adverb it seems to be acting like in the original question 50 lines up
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:01:26] the hyphens add to my confusion too
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:01:46] if it's all hyphenated into a single word, then does it still matter?  lol
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:02:29] xiuxing: that feeling is correct
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:02:57] ksft: Thank you.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:03:34] xiuxing: I could say "I paid five dollars for the burger", so it isn't the end of the sentence, but noun adjuncts are singular
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:03:34] May I request a validation review of my feelings as well?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:03:46] and if there are five, it probably isn't singular otherwise
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[18:03:56] This 2 pound burger is 5 pounds.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:03:58] hoglahoo: I don't know
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:04:14] ksft: I know what you mean.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:04:19] I would say "two-decades-long career"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:04:25] wouldn't*
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:04:28] how about "This 2-pounds-heavy-burger is 2 pounds"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[18:04:30] seems about as arbitrary as "5 pounds" needing the plural
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:04:53] I wanted to say "five-dollars" doesn't sound to be followed by a noun, since I learned so.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:05:03] hoglahoo: I wouldn't say "two-pounds-heavy burger" *or* "two-pound-heavy burger"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:05:22] it's redundant and non-idiomatic
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:06:12] the hyphenation indicates the syntax, the same way prosody would in speech
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:06:13] ah, there are other cases where an adjective is involved, like "five year old kid".
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:06:30] is that your opinion of the original question of "two-decades-long-career" versus "two-decade-long-career" as well?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:06:31] "two pound burgers" might mean two of something called a "pound burger"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:06:37] "five years old kid" doesn't sound right to me.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:07:09] the career thing I would definitely not phrase either way, personally
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:07:25] hoglahoo: no, the "long" there is fine but optional
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:07:33] hm
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:07:40] but I would definitely say "decade" and not "decades"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	hoglahoo	[18:07:49] right
2021-03-20 11:49:21	ksft	[18:08:03] and in writing, I wouldn't put the hyphen before "career" or "burger"
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:10:44] Me, neither.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[18:11:04] unless confusing
2021-03-20 11:49:21	xiuxing	[19:03:15] 4:03am...
2021-03-20 11:49:21	rapier	[20:24:00] what does like outer space mean in 'And now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space'? 
2021-03-20 11:49:21	rapier	[20:24:43] this is a lyric piece of Everything But The Girl - Missing 
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:28:59]  
2021-03-20 11:49:21	tinsoldier	[20:29:00] GuiToris: 15:42Z <nalkri>tell GuiToris The BBC is one of the UK's public service broadcasters, they have a number of TV channels, radio stations, and other media
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:29:49] nalkri, does it mean there's no such a channel BBC?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[20:30:58] "BBC" isn't a channel
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:31:11] is CNN a channel?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[20:31:14] British Assemble.
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:32:19] it sounds like as if BBC were a company
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[20:32:24] Yes
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[20:32:30] CNN is some American shit
2021-03-20 11:49:21	nalkri	[20:32:51] it's the British Broadcasting Corporation
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:33:00] can you name a few channels that belong to BBC?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:33:13] but in that case I don't know why my teacher advised me to watch BBC
2021-03-20 11:49:21	blkshp	[20:33:39] Bbc 1, BBC 2, BBC, three, BBC four, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC radio 5 live, BBC America, B....
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:33:58] #3 is just bbc?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:34:20] or did you mean bbc three?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:34:43] I'm asking this because I think we had a channel named '4'
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:36:15] now I found something
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:37:21] https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000t941/comic-relief-2021-red-nose-day
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:37:31] this cannot be watched online, can it?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:37:47] we never got to four... :(
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:38:06] huf_, you don't have 4 tv channels?!
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:38:12] alternatively, four was never called four
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:38:17] it was called rtl klub
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:38:26] rtl is german
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:38:30] yes, but this isnt
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:05] we had m1, tv2, tv3 (short-lived), rtl klub, ... etc
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:20] but no, we obviously have more channels
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:39:23] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_(German_TV_channel) aren't you talking about this?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:28] like tv paprika, our own cooking channel
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:36] complete with badly dubbed foreign cooking shows
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:39] and some of our own
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:48] GuiToris: no
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:39:55] I would've said rtl, not rtl klub
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:40:12] I'm checking it
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:40:35] note that most of my info on hungarian tv is like a decade out of date
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:40:45] I have no idea what the fuck is going on today
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:40:51] but we've had HBO since the 90s
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:41:19] comedy channel with unfortunate dubs since ... whenever
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:41:33] but no channel 4
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:41:34] I haven't seen HBO for a long time
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:42:17] we had to buy a separate decoder to watch it
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:42:33] it was in the early 2000s
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:42:44] I'm at the point with tv where ads are more interesting than whatever shit they have on
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:42:51] because I havent seen ads in a decade or so
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:43:27] neither have I, but I don't watch TV and I use uBlock Origin on my computer
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:43:49] they say YouTube is full of ads
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:43:57] it is
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:44:07] videos have their own ads
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:44:48] I'm very grateful for the creators of adblockers
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:45:28] I wish there were some glasses that could do the same when I wait for the bus
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:47:38] ads are a crime
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:48:21] blatantly wasting human attention, one of our scarce resources, is irresponsible
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:48:30] people already waste so much attention
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:49:09] I'm totally agree with you
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:49:23] -m
2021-03-20 11:49:21	huf_	[20:50:20] there has to be a better way to let people know that there's new stuff
2021-03-20 11:49:21	darsie	[20:51:30] hi GuiToris
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:52:03] hello darsie
2021-03-20 11:49:21	Unlimiter	[20:53:46] what do we call a post that's been replied to?
2021-03-20 11:49:21	GuiToris	[20:55:41] huf_, I find it funny that Stallman only wears solid color t-shirts, because he doesn't want to endorse any company
2021-03-20 11:49:21	lucky	[20:57:46] I generally avoid any corporate logos on my clothing
2021-03-20 11:49:21	lucky	[20:57:54] I am not a billboard
2021-03-20 11:49:21	audrey	[20:58:05] :D
2021-03-20 11:49:21	lucky	[20:58:12] I'm not Stallman-religious about it though :)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	audrey	[20:58:15] You should get paid to wear corporate logos on your clothing
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[20:58:53] you can hardly find shoes that don't have any logos on
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:00:06] pumps
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:00:16] Brown size 9
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:00:22] Fork'andlez
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:00:27] mine even have mirrored logos on their soles in case I walk in the desert, I should leave some trace
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:02:11] I just bought a new pair of boots before the winter.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:03:12] were they made for walking?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:03:19] They're not bad for it.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:03:30] (:
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:03:36] just *what* will they do? stay tuned to find out
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:03:37] lucky, https://media.proidee.ch/pimg/1300/c3/1300_c315463t_0715.jpg
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:03:45] heh
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:03:59] you have grown
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:04:07] BLKSHP, why are you so aggressive?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	BLKSHP	[21:04:21] JESS SAYS IT'S CAPPY HOUR
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:04:36] this reminds me of the episode in fabuland where they argue about who's tallest
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:04:39] BLKSHP, I read crappy
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:04:42] and use stilts to become taller
2021-03-20 11:49:22	BLKSHP	[21:04:52] yes, it probably will be ;)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:05:14] http://marks.scene7.com/is/image/marksp/103195_5CPAWRF18-1231_PROD_2_BLACK?bgColor=0,0,0,0&op_sharpen=1&resMode=sharp2&fmt=jpg 
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:05:34] that is a shoe!
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:05:35] it does have a ittle manufacturer tag insisting it has "very dry" technology on the side, but that's it 
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:05:43] little*
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Loshki	[21:05:50] BLKSHP: the two ronnies?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	BLKSHP	[21:05:58] \o/
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:06:08] lucky, there's a logon on it, isn't there?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:06:10] huf_: somewhere between a shoe and a boot, I suppose
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:06:29] lucky: oh no, I meant that I recognise that object
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:06:30] GuiToris: On the tongue and on the underside, yep.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:06:38] this is the level we are at currently
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:07:04] lucky, what is next to the first hole? (from above)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:07:23] GuiToris: a tag that says "VERY DRY TECHNOLOGY" heh
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:07:28] Accurate enough.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:07:44] Marketers will drive me insane one day.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:08:07] you have a duty to mankind to deliberately not look at it
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:08:12] any marketing stuff
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:08:25] lucky, in that case that oval shape around the heel area must be a logo
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:08:25] train your eyes to glaze over immediately
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:08:34] huf_: I actually do try to do that :/
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:08:42] :D
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:08:47] is there a word for a post that's been replied to (like "parent" but not "parent")
2021-03-20 11:49:22	huf_	[21:09:09] lucky: the ways we try to cope to the modern jungle...
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:09:11] Unlimiter: Original post is used to refer to the start of a thread

2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:09:27] (:
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:09:34] origin maybe
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:09:54] top post, sometimes
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:10:11] no single word?

2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:10:20] origin would be clear in context, I think
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:10:32] hmm
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:10:44] initial?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:10:50] still an adjective though, not a noun
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:10:59] still a word
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:11:09] ill use a thesaurus
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:11:54] source and root seem good enough

2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:13:58] I'll*
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:14:06] ok I'll
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:14:16] Better
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:14:19] geez
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:15:01] For your insolence, you will capitalise properly too.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	lucky	[21:15:10] that's rather ill-mannered
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:15:17] nice one
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:15:30] I mean: Nice one
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:15:35] Much better.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:15:39] Nice one.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:16:19] It'll be a lot of work.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:16:27] I'm not used to this.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:16:44] Do try, it'll make you, perhaps not feel better but be better.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:16:52] LOL
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:17:27] Unlimiter, If you check the channels ban list, you'll find 31 addresses. Those are the ones who kept arguing with blkshp
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:17:52] A few of them only accidentally left out a punctuation mark
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:18:06] Holy!
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:19:06] I probably should go through that list sometime
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:19:18] You think?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:19:35] Nope all fine.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:19:47] blkshp, You don't have to... They would still start the sentence with a lower case letter
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:20:06] blkshp: Your name isn't capitalized.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:20:14] That's correct.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:20:20] Chief George Earl.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:20:33] Your name isn't a word either.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:20:41] It doesn't need to be
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:20:51] Fair enough.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:20:58] Unlimiter, This isn't how things work... You cannot tell your boss what mistakes he does
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:21:08] Of course you can.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:21:12] Once
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:21:38] Fooled you. Unlimiter isn't a word.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:21:46] I wasn't fooled.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:21:50] :(
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[21:22:04] muahahaha
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:22:22] muahaha: no such file or directory
2021-03-20 11:49:22	bin_bash	[21:22:45] o.O

2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:23:18] Unlimiter, Your courage will not be rewarded
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:23:32] What?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:24:43] Hi bin_bash! Do you know bin_zsh?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:24:58] Unlimiter, it was nice to meet you
2021-03-20 11:49:22	bin_bash	[21:25:03] It's my bot, so yes.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:25:19] Nice.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Unlimiter	[21:25:32] GuiToris: You too.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	GuiToris	[21:30:35] I'll be back

2021-03-20 11:49:22	Loshki	[22:14:09] Hmm. sisyphean is not in my spell checker. You'd think of all people they'd know the word.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:14:23] Hi
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Loshki	[22:15:27] Oh, you know what. Sisyphean is there, but it has to be capitalized.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:18:24] what does it mean
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:18:52] Question marks please.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:21:20] wut, is it really mandatory to put a question mark even if it's clearly visible that I wrote a question? If so, my god --'
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:21:34] Yes.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:21:52] Because this is a channel where people come to learn and practice English. 
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:22:55] is it me or this channel became really formal for just small details
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:23:14] Question marks please.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:24:26] I understand your point of view but gosh, it's not that a big deal to not put a question mark
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:24:50] even learners can understand that it was a question
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:25:05] they are not stupid
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:25:08] But how do they then know that that wasn't a question, or the one above wasn't a question?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:25:13] This is a question
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:25:15] or is it?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:25:43] Just use the damn question mark and stop pretending that you are above the requirements for being understood properly.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:25:49] because of 'what' at the beginning
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:26:34] Arguing why wrong is right is unproductive and I will not continue it.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:26:40] I am not pretending, it's just basic stuff
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Vanyel	[22:26:50] it's the rule, asshole
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:27:03] stupid rule
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:27:06] Please don't call people names, regardless.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:27:08] Thanks.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:33:52] I don't want to have a headache and I won't continue this 'argument' and I don't like what this channel became...it was more relaxed before. I also think that ppl who come here to learn are not stupids and that they know at least how to guess that a sentence is a question w/o question mark.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:34:18] And, I don't deserve being called asshole just because I disagree with a rule
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:34:21] then
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:34:23] I leave
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Samus	[22:34:34] bye
2021-03-20 11:49:22	hoglahoo	[22:37:20] I agree, but it's still a good, helpful channel.  taking occasional breaks is healthy too.  bbl!  <Samus> ...it was more relaxed before...
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:42:04] It's not the missing the punctuation that really bothers me, what bothers me is the "No, I won't because I'm better than you all" that i cannot accept.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:42:18] s/that/and that
2021-03-20 11:49:22	tinsoldier	[22:42:19] b​lkshp meant: It's not the missing the punctuation and that really bothers me, what bothers me is the "No, I won't because I'm better than you all" that i cannot accept.

2021-03-20 11:49:22	blkshp	[22:55:59] yes!
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[00:19:51] Hello
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[00:23:44] I have a couple of questions please. Is the function of an object the thing for which the object has been manufactured.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[00:26:06] I think it would be better described as "purpose", but it can mean that
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[00:26:32] "function" basically means what something does
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[00:27:16] A ball doesn't have a function because it doesn't really do anything. But it has a purpose (for instance, to be thrown or kicked)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[00:27:26] furrykef, ok, for a device that does something, isn't that the same thing?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[00:27:33] Pretty much, yes
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[00:27:46] furrykef, ok, thanks a lot
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[00:27:51] You're welcome
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[00:31:45] My second question is, when we say that something was designed to reach a goal, would it be correct to interpret it as "it has been manufactured in a way to reach that goal"?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Loshki	[01:34:54] soulisson: they are separate concerns. You could have a really well designed thing that was nevertheless badly manufactured. 
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[01:41:15] Loshki, thanks but I'm not sure to understand because in the dictionary I have designed is defined as "created with a certain design" so I thought it wouldn't be too far to interpret it as the manufacturers did some things to reach that said goal (I always have problems with this word ...)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:45:19] Hey all :)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:45:34] What do you think about: `You may also find the store features useful`?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:45:40] Does it sound correct? :)
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:50:39] Appreciate it ^^
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[01:51:07] Voxel, is it like a virtual store?
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:53:30] soulisson, yup ^^
2021-03-20 11:49:22	garotosopa	[01:56:45] Hello. Could someone please try to help me understand what Bono from U2 says in this 4 seconds audio clip? For context, this is the intro to the song called "New Year's Day", live from Slane Castle, Ireland. https://vocaroo.com/1hu6TnVpsQMX
2021-03-20 11:49:22	soulisson	[01:57:16] Voxel, I don't see anything wrong but I'm not a native english speaker.
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:58:03] ++soulisson
2021-03-20 11:49:22	Voxel	[01:58:08] soulisson++

2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[02:42:04] garotosopa: I'll take a look
2021-03-20 11:49:22	furrykef	[02:43:14] garotosopa: I can't understand it, unfortunately
2021-03-20 11:49:22	garotosopa	[02:43:38] furrykef, Thank you for trying!

2021-03-20 13:07:46	Samian	I'm tired of people being selective with values. A company founder will pick his favorite virtues and say this is what we value.  How about valuing all values? They're all connected.  Value selection is just the evil work of language creeping into fallacious thinking as language frequently does
2021-03-20 13:08:05	Voxel	https://i.imgur.com/fq3i0WQ.png
2021-03-20 13:08:15	Samian	"Our values: Curiosity, Reliability, Intentionality, Drive, Benevolence" I just read
2021-03-20 13:08:45	Samian	what about honesty? What about living within your means? What about kindness and friendliness?
2021-03-20 13:09:10	Samian	values-picking is implicitly values-rejecting. It's implicitly saying you don't care as much about the other values
2021-03-20 13:09:47	Samian	In fact I can think of devastating examples that violate all sorts of different values.
2021-03-20 13:10:55	audrey	Samian: I wouldn´t read too much into any of that. It´s all virtue signalling anyway.
2021-03-20 13:11:34	Samian	They need to rethink whether they're actually accomplishing that goal. They aren't with me
2021-03-20 13:12:02	Samian	I look at the complete picture, the total package. I don't pick a few words

2021-03-20 13:12:17	 *	CuriosTiger notes that "our values" typically emphasizes values a company or group believe in. It's not a literal exclusion of all other values.
2021-03-20 13:13:01	Samian	maybe its a company trying to stress something they think isn't stressed enough
2021-03-20 13:13:20	Samian	maybe honesty and integrity weren't mentioned because they're givens
2021-03-20 13:13:51	CuriosTiger	I think your premise -- "values-picking is implicitly values-rejecting" -- is wrong.
2021-03-20 13:14:37	CuriosTiger	Honesty and integrity should be givens, and to most people, they are. Also, the list of virtues that you would expect from a company is pretty long.

2021-03-20 13:16:43	audrey	Samian: Don´t take this the wrong way, but I´m pretty sure you aren´t really the intended target for the virtue signaling
2021-03-20 13:16:59	Samian	CuriosTiger wrong or right, there are many components of communication. They're was the sender wants to communicate. There's what the receiver believes is the communication.  The receiver may verify whether they understood the communication by rephrasing and restating the communication back to the sender.
2021-03-20 13:17:04	CuriosTiger	Let's pick ten. Honesty, integrity, responsibility, fairness, morality, hospitality, politeness, transparency, legality and equanimity. That's pretty hard to fit into a compact statement, and you'd still be able to attack the company for discriminating against women.
2021-03-20 13:17:08	Samian	Sometimes the sender doesn't care if they are misunderstood
2021-03-20 13:17:16	CuriosTiger	(because "equality" wasn't on the list, it must be excluded, right?"
2021-03-20 13:17:47	CuriosTiger	Samian: They're "what" the sender wants to communicate, yes.
2021-03-20 13:18:08	audrey	In my experience, this sort of thing usually originates with some executive up the food chain who is so out of touch he thinks it´s actually valuable.

2021-03-20 13:18:24	CuriosTiger	Perhaps this company feels that telling you they believe in reliability is more relevant than telling you they believe junk food is bad for you.
2021-03-20 13:18:37	Samian	There is (1) what the sender wnats to communicate; (2) what's actually received; (3) sometimes there's a verification process ensuring correct transmission between sender and receiver.
2021-03-20 13:18:39	CuriosTiger	They may believe the latter, but that doesn't matter much to the customer if all they want is a reliable water pump.
2021-03-20 13:19:00	Samian	My philosophy is that the meaning of a message is the message the sender doesn't mind the receiver believing it to be.
2021-03-20 13:19:45	Samian	Example: If Trump says something ambiguous knowing his followers will interpret it to mean X, and Trump doesn't clarify, then in fact meaning X is what trump wants to communicate.
2021-03-20 13:19:49	audrey	I think you´re assigning way too much importance to a generic corporate slogan.
2021-03-20 13:20:22	Samian	yeah you're right. Little stuff bother me. My comments here reflect more on me than on the companies I criticize
2021-03-20 13:20:47	CuriosTiger	A very politically charged example, but sure. People, especially politicians, often say -- or omit to say -- things with the strategic intent of having people read between the lines while having plausible deniability later.
2021-03-20 13:21:11	CuriosTiger	Samian: "Little stuff bothers me". "Stuff" is generally grammatically singular.
2021-03-20 13:21:37	Samian	little things bother me?
2021-03-20 13:21:48	audrey	Don´t look at what a person says, look at what he does. (And the same is true for corporations, per a certain politician´s famous dictum that corporations are people.)
2021-03-20 13:21:52	Samian	Should have I wrote "things"  instead of "stuff" ?
2021-03-20 13:22:40	Samian	audrey yes I totally agree. The issue with words is that they place their own color on a situation.
2021-03-20 13:22:49	CuriosTiger	"Little things bother me" is fine. "Litte stuff bothers me" is also fine. You just need your verb to agree with the noun.
2021-03-20 13:23:41	Samian	Little stuffs (plural) bother me :)
2021-03-20 13:24:22	CuriosTiger	That's grammatically valid, although an uncommon usage.
2021-03-20 13:24:35	audrey	That can work as a countable noun!

2021-03-20 13:47:05	drbean-	The 'it' in 'It's going to rain' is supposed to be pleonastic, meaning it's just a dummy word used to satisfy the grammatical requirement that sentences have a subject.

2021-03-20 13:51:24	CuriosTiger	That makes the case for "weather" not being a dummy word, which it isn't.
2021-03-20 13:51:40	CuriosTiger	If "it" was not a dummy word, then that substitution would sound natural.
2021-03-20 13:52:07	drbean-	Mmh. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_pronoun
2021-03-20 13:52:52	CuriosTiger	Yep. As you can read in that article: "Unlike a regular pronoun of English, it cannot be replaced by any noun phrase."
2021-03-20 13:53:52	nalkri	I sometimes find myself wrongly adding dummy pronouns in Finnish because they'd be there in English
2021-03-20 13:54:32	drbean-	"The weather's going to do", "It's going to ..". The parallelism is coincidental?

2021-03-20 13:56:00	drbean-	I agree 
2021-03-20 13:56:18	drbean-	'The weather's going to rain' is not said.
2021-03-20 13:56:42	drbean-	'The weather's going to get better/worse' is said.
2021-03-20 13:57:28	CuriosTiger	Sure. You can get an even closer parallel by verbifying those terms. The weather is worsening.
2021-03-20 13:57:50	CuriosTiger	And if you subsequently confirm "It's worsening", then yes, that's a regular pronoun, not a dummy pronoun.
2021-03-20 13:58:06	CuriosTiger	But you cannot substitute "The weather is raining" and get a natural-sounding sentence.
2021-03-20 13:58:41	drbean-	According to the wikipedia article, Dwight Bolinger said  'it' is implied to mean "the local weather".
2021-03-20 13:59:10	CuriosTiger	Yes, in the section giving alternative views.
2021-03-20 13:59:14	drbean-	A: Was it nice out today? B: No it rained.
2021-03-20 13:59:20	CuriosTiger	I don't agree with him, and I'd give him this same explanation.
2021-03-20 14:00:05	CuriosTiger	The substitution doesn't work. "A: Was the weather nice out today?" is fine. "B: No, the weather rained." is not.
2021-03-20 14:00:31	drbean-	He's arguing semantically, not grammatically.
2021-03-20 14:00:37	CuriosTiger	You can certainly SAY "No, the weather rained." and people will understand what you mean. But it will sound wrong, or foreign.
2021-03-20 14:00:57	CuriosTiger	Grammar is an essential piece of semantics, so that is a distinction without a difference.
2021-03-20 14:01:38	drbean-	He's saying what does the 'it' in 'it rained' refer to. He's not saying 'The local weather rained' is grammatical.
2021-03-20 14:02:05	CuriosTiger	But he's arguing that it's not a dummy pronoun. If it's not a dummy pronoun, then substitutions should work. They do not.
2021-03-20 14:02:43	CuriosTiger	As far as formal logic goes, showing the substitution doesn't work disproves his assertion by counterexample.
