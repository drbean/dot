2020-09-05 11:42:18	drbean	From all the duckduckgo hits for 'I can confirm', it seems this is the way to use 'confirm' when it's you who's doing it.
2020-09-05 11:44:16	drbean	I guess it is the speech act of confirming (using 'can'), like 'Can you close the window' is the speech act of requesting (using 'can').

2020-09-10 22:58:33	tinwhiskers	the only one I've seen so far that is really wrong is "The harbor was left by the ship"

2020-09-10 22:59:08	wkalt	yeah tinwhiskers that one is the oddest seeming one but I see no reason it's not correct. Usual advice is "don't use the passive voice".

2020-09-10 23:03:18	tinwhiskers	"The harbor was left by the ship" is just very weird but "The harbor was left by a ship with a black flag" is fine.
2020-09-10 23:04:49	wkalt	I wouldn't say they are weird, but both can be improved with the active voice. "The ship left the harbor", "The black-flagged ship left the harbor" are both more natural IMO.

2020-09-10 23:42:05	tinwhiskers	knowing that things are publicly logged has a chilling effect on the freedom people feel to communicate so it's often not allowed.
2020-09-10 23:42:21	gildarts	Yeah, you should assume that just to be safe, but that doesn't mean ops aren't going to enforce that rule.

2020-09-10 23:54:07	Kaylah	oh, sorry if it's a bit offtopic
2020-09-10 23:54:32	drbean	Use google translate?
2020-09-10 23:54:54	Kaylah	it translates it too literaly
2020-09-10 23:54:59	Kaylah	literally*
2020-09-10 23:55:05	drbean	But it translates 'cheap' into Chinese as the equivalent of 'stingy'.
2020-09-10 23:55:14	Kaylah	lol
2020-09-10 23:55:25	Kaylah	it's a very technical term
2020-09-10 23:56:11	drbean	Translate it in a longer context. It may have a better translation like it does for 'not cheap, expensive'
2020-09-10 23:56:28	Kaylah	i'll try that, thanks

2020-09-10 23:58:49	drbean	What is the Dutch strategy for transfering technical terms into English?
2020-09-10 23:59:28	tinwhiskers	so I guess it means "net" as in "complete"... "complete section failure" might translate better.
2020-09-10 23:59:32	Kaylah	going to the wiki page in English, and then clicking 'Dutch' in the language column on the right, and seeing what the new title is :p
2020-09-10 23:59:45	drbean	Use google translate to translate other terms which give good translations and then adopt the same strategy to translate 'net section failure'
2020-09-11 00:00:13	Kaylah	I'm not sure if that's what it means in this context tinsoldier, could also be in contrast to "gross section", but I'm not sure what extra part of the section that would include
2020-09-11 00:00:48	tinwhiskers	well, it is also describing a complete (bilateral) failure.

2020-09-11 00:06:16	nalkri	I'd guess it's net (section failure)
2020-09-11 00:06:17	nalkri	on balance the section fails
2020-09-11 00:06:20	Kaylah	I came across that one too and tried to dig deeper on that, but no luck
2020-09-11 00:06:23	tinwhiskers	well, it's not going to mean net as in fishing net, it's going to mean net as in complete.
2020-09-11 00:06:34	Kaylah	haha :p
2020-09-11 00:06:35	nalkri	but it could be complete as in total rather than on balance
2020-09-11 00:06:39	drbean	If 'net section failure' is not a term of art in English, then it's unlikely there is a term of art in Dutch to which 'net section failure' is the English equivalent.
2020-09-11 00:07:06	papna	nalkri: No, it's (net section) fracture

2020-09-11 00:26:09	drbean	'net section' 'gross section' must have equivalents in Dutch.
2020-09-11 00:26:43	drbean	I assume 'net section' is the weaker direction, 'gross' is the stronger.
2020-09-11 00:27:17	Kaylah	hmm well I know that for bolts there is a difference between different cross sections
2020-09-11 00:27:48	Kaylah	a bolt is like a cylinder, but if the bolt is threaded, then the edges are not smooth
2020-09-11 00:28:12	Kaylah	and the net section is then the area of the section that makes up a circle, and everything outside of that circle doesn't count
2020-09-11 00:28:15	drbean	'netto sectie' says google.
2020-09-11 00:28:17	Kaylah	whereas the gross section is the entire section
