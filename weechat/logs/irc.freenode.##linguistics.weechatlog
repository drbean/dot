2013-09-06 22:50:56	theriel	that game is still only basically major languages
2013-09-06 22:52:29	Leftmost	I'm actually worse at the IE ones than the others.

2013-09-06 23:01:55	theriel	yeah
2013-09-06 23:05:19	yeryry	It would be easier if the samples were higher quality
2013-09-06 23:06:12	theriel	some of them are, some of them aren't
2013-09-06 23:06:28	theriel	and i'm pretty sure that for lesser known languages even high quality wouldn't help
2013-09-06 23:06:51	Leftmost	I cheated on Thai. I figured out the first sample they gave me, and then they gave me two more clearly from the same recording.
2013-09-06 23:07:06	theriel	oh, you got 3 of the same language?
2013-09-06 23:07:09	yeryry	Probably not, but some of the better known languages are poor quality

2013-09-06 23:07:55	yeryry	Also, if there's a tendency for smaller languages to have worse files, that would make guessing easier...
2013-09-06 23:08:14	yeryry	300
2013-09-06 23:08:37	Leftmost	My top so far is 550.
2013-09-06 23:08:50	cntrational	the soundclips are from news reports
2013-09-06 23:08:54	yeryry	It's very dependant on luck too
2013-09-06 23:09:02	cntrational	heh
2013-09-06 23:09:09	theriel	mine is still 1000, but i only played twice :P
2013-09-06 23:09:18	cntrational	friends of mine have gotten things like yiddish vs german or hindi vs urdu
2013-09-06 23:09:32	theriel	i'd get the first one, probably, since i speak german
2013-09-06 23:09:39	theriel	hindi vs urdu is impossible
2013-09-06 23:09:43	theriel	it's the same language
2013-09-06 23:09:48	cntrational	yeah
2013-09-06 23:10:01	theriel	they have too many indic languages in general :P
2013-09-06 23:10:17	theriel	i can't tell the difference between gujarati and hindi
2013-09-06 23:11:14	theriel	i go by phonological traits for languages i don't know.. amharic has ejectives, lao has unrounded back vowels, maori has limited number of consonants and CVCV structures, etc
2013-09-06 23:11:34	theriel	but the indic area in general has similar phonologies with a lot of the language
2013-09-06 23:11:37	theriel	s
2013-09-06 23:11:52	theriel	at least some of the northern indian languages (outside of the himalayas)
2013-09-06 23:12:16	theriel	languages like toda or ladakhi would be a lot easier to tell the difference :D
2013-09-06 23:14:26	cntrational	a lot of people seem to trip up on the indic ones
2013-09-06 23:14:50	theriel	well, can you give any typological suggestions?
2013-09-06 23:14:55	theriel	things to listen for?
2013-09-06 23:15:03	cntrational	a friend of mine who speaks hindi and urdu tripped up on nepali because he thought it was totally different from the first two
2013-09-06 23:15:30	cntrational	uh, not really, the indic and dravidian langs are all phonologically similar
2013-09-06 23:15:34	cntrational	except for maybe tamil i guess
2013-09-06 23:15:45	theriel	hrm, not dravidian, some of those can be weird
2013-09-06 23:16:07	cntrational	hmm
2013-09-06 23:21:40	theriel	http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/TCX/tcx_word-list_1992_61.mp3 there is toda :D
2013-09-06 23:21:44	theriel	that's a dravidian language
2013-09-06 23:22:08	theriel	and honestly, to my ears it just doesn't sound familiar to much of anything
2013-09-06 23:22:33	cntrational	well, major dravidian langs aside from tamil are very indic sounding :r
2013-09-06 23:22:43	theriel	this isn't a major one :D
2013-09-06 23:22:49	cntrational	yeah
2013-09-06 23:22:54	theriel	take a listen, i'm curious of your own opinion
2013-09-06 23:22:58	theriel	it's more your neck of the woods than mine
2013-09-06 23:23:40	cntrational	well, can't listen now
2013-09-06 23:23:52	cntrational	but remind me later and i'll take a listen
2013-09-06 23:27:47	theriel	k
2013-09-06 23:33:43	theriel	toda has 6 different r-trills btw :)
2013-09-06 23:35:37	cntrational	yeah
2013-09-06 23:36:56	theriel	hrm, didn't realize there were dravidian languages not in the south
2013-09-06 23:37:04	theriel	although they seem to be pretty small

2013-09-07 20:23:29	sytse	cntrational: I wonder how that happens, that fat lathering of 'something xxx-sounding' that's very recognizable even for someone with barely any contact with any of the languages, that seems to be draped over often quite large groups of languages -- scandinavian languages, indic languages, languages in the neighbourhood of china (except of course, for korean, japanese, etc), languages sounding a bit like arabic, eastern bloc languages/russian, etc
2013-09-07 20:24:49	cntrational	hmm
2013-09-07 20:25:38	sytse	impossible to analyse because it's more than a little subjective and error-prone :]

2013-09-07 23:52:20	cntrational	oh, right
2013-09-07 23:52:23	cntrational	link it again?
2013-09-07 23:53:24	theriel	http://archive.phonetics.ucla.edu/Language/TCX/tcx_word-list_1992_61.mp3
2013-09-07 23:53:36	theriel	just from ladefoged's old recordings
2013-09-07 23:54:29	cntrational	hmm, it does sound indic-y
2013-09-07 23:55:08	cntrational	though the occasional sound is kinda odd
2013-09-07 23:55:24	theriel	the vowels for me seemed strange
2013-09-07 23:55:54	theriel	ɨ and ɵ aren't vowels i have heard in that kind of frequency before
2013-09-07 23:56:03	theriel	especially the ɵ
2013-09-08 00:12:37	theriel	do you speak any dravidian languages?
2013-09-08 00:18:39	cntrational	telugu, yes, but it's a bit rusty
2013-09-08 00:18:54	cntrational	(and often mixed in with english :r)
2013-09-08 00:32:10	theriel	yeah i saw something in ethiopia which i could easily imagine in india
2013-09-08 00:32:41	theriel	i saw a talk about a language isolate there which is now almost extinct, in addis ababa, and the person giving the talk actually had some of the last remaining speakers with him
2013-09-08 00:32:54	theriel	his talk was in english, but the main language in ethiopia is amharic

2013-09-08 00:33:15	theriel	after the talk one guy in the audience asked him if the ethnic group had any interest in revitalizing the language
2013-09-08 00:33:28	theriel	and he said "why don't you ask them yourself?  they don't speak english though, just amharic"
2013-09-08 00:33:53	theriel	so the guy turned to them and asked in amharic, "blahblahblah language revitalization blahblah" and the people just stared at him
2013-09-08 00:34:01	theriel	and then he realized he couldn't code switch at all :D
2013-09-08 00:34:06	theriel	he had to think of terms in amharic
2013-09-08 00:34:38	theriel	i'd be willing to bet most of the indian middle/upper class would be hard pressed to speak in 5 minutes about more educated topics without once code-switching to english :P
2013-09-08 00:38:09	theriel	incidentally, i wouldn't be surprised if ethiopia and india ended up developing a lot closer relations in general at some point
2013-09-08 00:38:19	theriel	there are a LOT of cultural similarities, surprisingly enough
2013-09-08 00:38:44	theriel	not due to anything other than coincidence, but it's still notable
2013-09-08 00:46:03	cntrational	hmm
2013-09-08 00:46:54	cntrational	theriel: one twist of the situation is that while most people do use english loans, the official way is just to coin from Sanskrit roots
2013-09-08 00:47:04	cntrational	which is sometimes taken really far
2013-09-08 00:47:20	cntrational	like replacing Arabo-Persian loans with Sanskrit ones
2013-09-08 00:47:59	cntrational	or, particularly for Hindi, even replacing native words affected by soundchange with Sanskrit equivalents
2013-09-08 00:50:05	cntrational	e.g., pustakēṁ instead of kitāb

2013-09-14 02:22:46	YaRly	so just "spelling reform"?
2013-09-14 02:24:06	YaRly	I'm trying to tag a form of a word in a language, and the change that has happened is that a majority of people skip one of the letters because it looks better, I was thinking of adding "assimilated form" but that's not entirely correct
2013-09-14 02:24:07	Leftmost	Reform to me implies an intentional effort to change spelling conventions, though spellings can change on their own over time.
2013-09-14 02:24:29	YaRly	no, it's not intentional
2013-09-14 02:24:35	YaRly	it's because of the speakers

2013-09-16 02:39:42	zebr	wait no that wasn't the question i meant to ask. the question i *meant* to ask was, is there a minimal pair for 'OE ō / ME oo' and 'OE o / ME ō'?

2013-09-21 02:46:07	ajf	so, instead of - and -s for singular and plural, you'd have, say, - for singular, -s for plural < 10^1 (i.e. 2-9), -as for 10^1 <= plural < 10^2 (i.e. 10-99), -es for 10^2 <= plural < 10^3 (i.e. 100-999), etc. :P

2013-09-21 02:56:07	theriel	and see if that affects your conlang
2013-09-21 02:56:18	theriel	other bases than 10 seem to be fairly common, anyway

2013-09-22 00:07:10	YaRly	I was talking with a linguist who made the distinction between zero morphemes and empty morphemes. Zero morphemes are meaningless but add sounds/letters, whereas empty morphemes adds no sound/letters, or something
2013-09-22 00:07:13	YaRly	is this correct? :S
2013-09-22 00:07:18	YaRly	couldn't find much about it online
2013-09-22 00:10:19	YaRly	both add no meaning
2013-09-22 00:10:50	YaRly	hmm...found something that verifies it here: http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/rbeard/homepage.html
2013-09-22 00:12:05	YaRly	wikipedia's article about null morphemes makes no distinction between zero and empty morphemes though

2013-09-22 22:47:45	YaRly	From what I read in the above article, there is a difference between zero and empty morphemes. (Again, both are meaningless but empty morphemes add no sounds whereas zero morphemes add a sound.)

2013-09-23 02:29:29	Biels	hey guys
2013-09-23 02:29:37	Biels	what do the idiom 'the writing on the wall' mean?
2013-09-23 02:29:52	Biels	I always thought it was about portending doom in some indefinite period of time
2013-09-23 02:30:06	Biels	but wiki says:
2013-09-23 02:30:08	Biels	"The writing on the wall", or "the handwriting on the wall", or "the writing is on the wall" or "Mene Mene", is an idiom for "imminent doom or misfortune"
2013-09-23 02:30:19	Biels	*imminent* doom?
2013-09-23 02:30:23	Biels	your thoughts, guys?

2013-09-26 07:17:13	gabmint	I'll just fire off:
2013-09-26 07:18:15	gabmint	I am a linguist
2013-09-26 07:18:33	gabmint	I can say I adhere to a structuralist, functionalist paradigm
2013-09-26 07:18:47	gabmint	I was never impressed by generative linguistics
2013-09-26 07:19:29	gabmint	my only contact with it was long ago when I was a student, and that was not very deep anyway
2013-09-26 07:19:49	gabmint	the thing is: I never really needed to know about generative linguistics
2013-09-26 07:19:57	Parth	o-O

2013-09-26 07:22:39	gabmint	are you a linguist?
2013-09-26 07:22:47	Parth	not really

2013-09-26 07:24:15	Parth	because I idle errrrwhere. just like these people :P
2013-09-26 07:24:28	gabmint	no way

2013-09-26 23:47:33	sytse	theriel: oh, a verb. Hmm, well, first off, I'm not sure if using multiple words when we want to add the additional indication of specificity of location to a verb with the meaning 'to exist' is abuse
2013-09-26 23:47:33	theriel	:D
2013-09-26 23:47:40	theriel	it was random grumbling, not serious, don't worry
2013-09-26 23:48:01	theriel	just created some inconvenience when glossing
2013-09-26 23:48:03	sytse	theriel: secondly, dutch doesn't have a common single verb for that either, and says 'be somewhere' as well
2013-09-26 23:48:14	sytse	still, it piqued my interest :P
2013-09-26 23:48:34	theriel	hrm, can't they use something like.. lagen?  laggen?  not sure what the cognate is :D
2013-09-26 23:48:49	theriel	swedish can do that, and it doesn't just mean literally lying
2013-09-26 23:48:53	sytse	I can't imagine there isn't a latin word *somewhere* in the english dictionary that has that meaning ;-)
2013-09-26 23:48:55	theriel	more like situate or such
2013-09-26 23:49:02	sytse	hmm
2013-09-26 23:50:44	sytse	didn't you just name the cognate? To lie? (dutch, liggen)
2013-09-26 23:50:57	sytse	ie, lie as in down, not about
2013-09-26 23:51:14	sytse	(the latter is liegen in dutch)
2013-09-26 23:52:40	theriel	liegen, ah
2013-09-26 23:53:08	theriel	yeah english can't use lie like that, german can use it to an extent, only with actual concrete things, and swedish can use it also for abstract/non-visible
2013-09-26 23:53:16	theriel	(concrete things on a flat surface, that is)
2013-09-26 23:53:21	sytse	but uhm. Situate something else? Or be situated? In dutch, 'neerleggen' means to situate (usually an object, but 'zichzelf neerleggen', to situate oneself in a horizontal position, works as well)
2013-09-26 23:53:42	sytse	'neer' means 'down' btw
2013-09-26 23:53:53	theriel	neer?  not neder?
2013-09-26 23:54:22	sytse	neer was spelled with a ^ on the second e in the 19th century and before to indicate the dropping of d
2013-09-26 23:54:25	sytse	so no
2013-09-26 23:54:53	theriel	how about if you wanted to say that the eiffel tower is in paris?
2013-09-26 23:54:59	sytse	'nederland' is an exception; in the 19th century, it was commonly 'neerland', but regressed to nederland somehow
2013-09-26 23:55:02	theriel	can you use any other verb than to be?
2013-09-26 23:56:10	sytse	'nederig' is another exception (cognate of niedrig, meaning 'humble', presumably from a literal sense of prostrating oneself)
2013-09-26 23:56:27	sytse	'de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs'.. hmm, yes, that works
2013-09-26 23:57:33	sytse	although it's very informal language
2013-09-26 23:57:33	theriel	see, you have it too then
2013-09-26 23:57:47	theriel	english is missing a similar construction
2013-09-26 23:58:17	theriel	we also can't use "find oneself" or something similar
2013-09-26 23:58:31	theriel	or well, in very very limited instances, to show surprise
2013-09-26 23:59:31	sytse	in what meaning, exactly?
2013-09-26 23:59:35	sytse	(in swedish)
2013-09-27 00:00:58	sytse	also, english does use 'to sit' in that sense; it's sitting on the shelf, for example
2013-09-27 00:01:06	theriel	german this time :D  to be somewhere
2013-09-27 00:01:10	sytse	iirc
2013-09-27 00:02:34	sytse	oh right.. not find (vinden) in dutch, but bevinden.. hmm. Bevinden is actually literally what you meant, so be situated somewhere. Interesting.. I didn't come up with that one earlier :S
2013-09-27 00:02:45	sytse	de eiffeltoren bevindt zich in parijs, is the formal version of de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs
2013-09-27 00:03:30	sytse	(but that's not a single verb; even objects like the eiffel tower need to bevind 'oneself' in paris)
2013-09-27 00:04:06	theriel	well it's a reflexive verb, but it's just the syntactic construction
2013-09-27 00:04:18	sytse	sure
2013-09-27 00:04:19	theriel	towers can't find something.. they're not animate
2013-09-27 00:04:52	theriel	but you can't say "the eiffel tower finds itself in paris" :D
2013-09-27 00:04:54	sytse	'bevinden' cannot be used transitively at all actually in modern language afaik, only reflexively
2013-09-27 00:05:01	sytse	hehe
2013-09-27 00:05:01	theriel	that means that it's doing soul searching and finally realize who it is
2013-09-27 00:05:08	sytse	yep
2013-09-27 00:05:36	theriel	you're just proving my point btw :D
2013-09-27 00:05:48	theriel	even all the closest languages to english have something we don't :~
2013-09-27 00:06:02	theriel	i realize english may have other constructions, but it was just this one that i was doing and feeling grumbly about
2013-09-27 00:06:06	sytse	but you can say the eiffel tower located itself into paris.. which means it walked there on its giant steel feet
2013-09-27 00:07:34	sytse	there is even a theory that the ancestral language of english is not old english at all but the language the vikings came in with btw :]
2013-09-27 00:07:34	theriel	yeah i read that :)
2013-09-27 00:08:02	theriel	doesn't matter actually in this case, since the low and high german varieties in addition to the scandinavian varities all have these :P

2013-09-27 00:08:35	theriel	i dunno though, hard to say for sure
2013-09-27 00:08:59	sytse	although you get strange things anyhow when a different language is mixed in.. just like with humans; descended from apes, but pigs mixed in, supposedly
2013-09-27 00:09:23	theriel	dutch/frisian are probably the easiest languages to understand, anyway, if you speak english
2013-09-27 00:09:34	sytse	hm, really?
2013-09-27 00:09:37	theriel	even without studying dutch i'd probably pick it up in some weeks if i moved there
2013-09-27 00:09:39	sytse	I've heard many people say otherwise
2013-09-27 00:09:59	sytse	(I cannot possibly judge that for myself as it's my native tongue)
2013-09-27 00:10:31	theriel	the orthography isn't particularly intuitive, and the sound changes take some getting used to (g -> χ), but it's still pretty easy
2013-09-27 00:10:45	sytse	hm, the orthography is very regular though
2013-09-27 00:11:24	sytse	it was consciously redesigned one and a half century ago to correspond as closely as possible to pronunciation and to be easy to teach (by a schoolteacher)
2013-09-27 00:12:54	theriel	i think it was the diphthongs that i found rather unintuitive
2013-09-27 00:13:59	theriel	ui isn't /yi/ or something, it's /æy/
2013-09-27 00:14:37	theriel	and then there's the conflation of length with quality that all the germanic languages have, almost
2013-09-27 00:14:38	sytse	sure.. and ei and ij merged in the 19th century

2013-09-27 00:15:52	sytse	yes. And many other phenomena like that that you don't find in english.. but that's not really something you can blame on the orthography imho
2013-09-27 00:16:13	theriel	sound changes?  i guess not
2013-09-27 00:16:22	theriel	english was reasonably phonetic 1000 years ago :D
2013-09-27 00:16:25	theriel	in its writing
2013-09-27 00:17:34	theriel	we're just not known for be willing to adjust or redesign things to correspond to pronunciation
2013-09-27 00:17:34	sytse	'other phenomena like that' as in, changes to phonemes dependent on phonological context
2013-09-27 00:18:49	theriel	ah, that's normal, i was thinking of historical rather than allophonic changes
2013-09-27 00:19:00	theriel	historical changes are what mess people up

2013-09-27 00:22:22	sytse	sure.. dutch only has 140 years of sound changes that mess up your understanding of the orthography, and the most important loss of vowel quality distinction got assimilated into the orthography after WW2
2013-09-27 00:25:19	sytse	(there were two long 'e' sounds besides /ɪː/, one of which got written ee, the other e; this distinction got dropped from the orthography)
2013-09-27 00:25:59	sytse	but I'm sure there are thousands upon thousands of exceptions just like in any language :D
2013-09-27 00:27:36	theriel	hrm, wasn't dutch written earlier than that?
2013-09-27 00:27:36	sytse	hmm. /ɪː/ is in neither the wikipedia article on dutch phonology, nor the article on dutch orthography
2013-09-27 00:27:36	sytse	big omission
2013-09-27 00:27:36	sytse	('beer' as in, bear is pronounced with that)
2013-09-27 00:28:18	cntrational	add it
2013-09-27 00:28:24	theriel	i thought the netherlands was a big part of the hanseatic league
2013-09-27 00:28:44	theriel	so i'd figure that there were older documents in dutch, from the 1400's, etc
2013-09-27 00:31:26	theriel	hrm bbl
2013-09-27 00:32:37	sytse	yes of course, it's just that a school teacher wrote a book in 1804 in which he explained a new, standard way of writing dutch, with VERY detailed arguments for why he thought so. Then some 50 years later a huge dictionary project (somewhat like the OED; now updated and freely searchable online) was started and they invented a somewhat different spelling, and the latter spelling has stuck
2013-09-27 00:33:01	sytse	just like in english, before that spelling was pretty much different from individual to individual, and a bit of a mess
2013-09-27 00:40:21	sytse	hm, now that I think about it, /ɪː/ only ever occurs before /r/, so it's 'eer' -> /ɪːr/, and all other instances of ee and free e (free as in, occurring in an open syllable) are /eː/

2013-10-01 11:13:16	xybre	What about Theta-Titanium? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGoISqcahM
2013-10-01 11:14:40	darkbox	Not quite what I was after but I at least have some new music to listen to hahaha
2013-10-01 11:16:31	 *	xybre is now reading the theta-criteron articles on wikipedia and glottopedia
2013-10-01 11:16:53	xybre	Glottopedia just has a little stub, not terribly helpful.
2013-10-01 11:17:00	xybre	"Theta Criterion: Every argument, e.g., NP, in a sentence must receive one and only one thematic role (e.g., agent, experiencer, theme, patient, goal, beneficiary); each thematic role associated with a theta-assigner (typically a verb) must be assigned to one and only one argument."
2013-10-01 11:17:27	darkbox	That's where I'm hitting my head against the wall.
2013-10-01 11:17:59	darkbox	I sat through a lecture on this and it made sense at the time, but now when it comes time to implement it in an exercise set... I don't seem to have gotten things quite as well as I thought I had.
2013-10-01 11:18:14	darkbox	It seems like there's a lack of information out there
2013-10-01 11:19:13	xybre	Is it something your textbook author was just really into?
2013-10-01 11:19:30	darkbox	If by textbook author you mean professor, yes.
2013-10-01 11:19:42	darkbox	So now I'm trying to make heads and tails out of what exactly they're after.
2013-10-01 11:19:45	Oladon1	If you read Chinese, I've got a professor-written textbook that probably talks a good bit about it :P

2013-10-01 11:20:09	darkbox	Thankfully they would rather we try new things and get it wrong than just fail us.
2013-10-01 11:20:20	darkbox	No Chinese ability here, sorry. Thanks though!
2013-10-01 11:20:30	xybre	darkbox: check out the references in the wikipedia article
2013-10-01 11:20:49	xybre	You can probably find ebook versions of them online, or the books themselves in the university library
2013-10-01 11:20:54	darkbox	That I'll do
2013-10-01 11:21:12	xybre	Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures and Sobin, Nicholas (2011). Syntactic Analysis The Basics
2013-10-01 11:23:05	darkbox	Ye 'ole Chomsky. Pretty sure he's my professor's hero.
2013-10-01 11:23:29	darkbox	And I mean that in a matter of fact way. Chomsky doesn't seem like he was off his rocker or whatever.
2013-10-01 11:25:13	xybre	Chomsky is interesting

2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:48:14] still, it piqued my interest :P
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:48:34] hrm, can't they use something like.. lagen?  laggen?  not sure what the cognate is :D
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:48:49] swedish can do that, and it doesn't just mean literally lying
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:48:53] I can't imagine there isn't a latin word *somewhere* in the english dictionary that has that meaning ;-)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:48:55] more like situate or such
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:49:02] hmm
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:50:44] didn't you just name the cognate? To lie? (dutch, liggen)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:50:57] ie, lie as in down, not about
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:51:14] (the latter is liegen in dutch)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:52:40] liegen, ah
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:53:08] yeah english can't use lie like that, german can use it to an extent, only with actual concrete things, and swedish can use it also for abstract/non-visible
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:53:16] (concrete things on a flat surface, that is)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:53:21] but uhm. Situate something else? Or be situated? In dutch, 'neerleggen' means to situate (usually an object, but 'zichzelf neerleggen', to situate oneself in a horizontal position, works as well)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:53:42] 'neer' means 'down' btw
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:53:53] neer?  not neder?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:54:22] neer was spelled with a ^ on the second e in the 19th century and before to indicate the dropping of d
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:54:25] so no
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:54:53] how about if you wanted to say that the eiffel tower is in paris?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:54:59] 'nederland' is an exception; in the 19th century, it was commonly 'neerland', but regressed to nederland somehow
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:55:02] can you use any other verb than to be?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:56:10] 'nederig' is another exception (cognate of niedrig, meaning 'humble', presumably from a literal sense of prostrating oneself)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:56:27] 'de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs'.. hmm, yes, that works
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:57:33] although it's very informal language
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:57:33] see, you have it too then
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:57:47] english is missing a similar construction
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:58:17] we also can't use "find oneself" or something similar
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[23:58:31] or well, in very very limited instances, to show surprise
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:59:31] in what meaning, exactly?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[23:59:35] (in swedish)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:00:58] also, english does use 'to sit' in that sense; it's sitting on the shelf, for example
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:01:06] german this time :D  to be somewhere
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:01:10] iirc
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:02:34] oh right.. not find (vinden) in dutch, but bevinden.. hmm. Bevinden is actually literally what you meant, so be situated somewhere. Interesting.. I didn't come up with that one earlier :S
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:02:45] de eiffeltoren bevindt zich in parijs, is the formal version of de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:03:30] (but that's not a single verb; even objects like the eiffel tower need to bevind 'oneself' in paris)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:04:06] well it's a reflexive verb, but it's just the syntactic construction
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:04:18] sure
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:04:19] towers can't find something.. they're not animate
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:04:52] but you can't say "the eiffel tower finds itself in paris" :D
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:04:54] 'bevinden' cannot be used transitively at all actually in modern language afaik, only reflexively
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:05:01] hehe
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:05:01] that means that it's doing soul searching and finally realize who it is
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:05:08] yep
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:05:36] you're just proving my point btw :D
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:05:48] even all the closest languages to english have something we don't :~
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:06:02] i realize english may have other constructions, but it was just this one that i was doing and feeling grumbly about
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:06:06] but you can say the eiffel tower located itself into paris.. which means it walked there on its giant steel feet
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:07:34] there is even a theory that the ancestral language of english is not old english at all but the language the vikings came in with btw :]
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:07:34] yeah i read that :)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:08:02] doesn't matter actually in this case, since the low and high german varieties in addition to the scandinavian varities all have these :P
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:08:35] i dunno though, hard to say for sure
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:08:59] although you get strange things anyhow when a different language is mixed in.. just like with humans; descended from apes, but pigs mixed in, supposedly
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:09:23] dutch/frisian are probably the easiest languages to understand, anyway, if you speak english
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:09:34] hm, really?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:09:37] even without studying dutch i'd probably pick it up in some weeks if i moved there
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:09:39] I've heard many people say otherwise
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:09:59] (I cannot possibly judge that for myself as it's my native tongue)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:10:31] the orthography isn't particularly intuitive, and the sound changes take some getting used to (g -> χ), but it's still pretty easy
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:10:45] hm, the orthography is very regular though
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:11:24] it was consciously redesigned one and a half century ago to correspond as closely as possible to pronunciation and to be easy to teach (by a schoolteacher)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:12:54] i think it was the diphthongs that i found rather unintuitive
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:13:59] ui isn't /yi/ or something, it's /æy/
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:14:37] and then there's the conflation of length with quality that all the germanic languages have, almost
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:14:38] sure.. and ei and ij merged in the 19th century
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:15:52] yes. And many other phenomena like that that you don't find in english.. but that's not really something you can blame on the orthography imho
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:16:13] sound changes?  i guess not
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:16:22] english was reasonably phonetic 1000 years ago :D
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:16:25] in its writing
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:17:34] we're just not known for be willing to adjust or redesign things to correspond to pronunciation
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:17:34] 'other phenomena like that' as in, changes to phonemes dependent on phonological context
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:18:49] ah, that's normal, i was thinking of historical rather than allophonic changes
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:19:00] historical changes are what mess people up
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:22:22] sure.. dutch only has 140 years of sound changes that mess up your understanding of the orthography, and the most important loss of vowel quality distinction got assimilated into the orthography after WW2
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:25:19] (there were two long 'e' sounds besides /ɪː/, one of which got written ee, the other e; this distinction got dropped from the orthography)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:25:59] but I'm sure there are thousands upon thousands of exceptions just like in any language :D
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:27:36] hrm, wasn't dutch written earlier than that?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:27:36] hmm. /ɪː/ is in neither the wikipedia article on dutch phonology, nor the article on dutch orthography
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:27:36] big omission
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:27:36] ('beer' as in, bear is pronounced with that)
2013-10-01 19:45:57	cntrational	[00:28:18] add it
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:28:24] i thought the netherlands was a big part of the hanseatic league
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:28:44] so i'd figure that there were older documents in dutch, from the 1400's, etc
2013-10-01 19:45:57	theriel	[00:31:26] hrm bbl
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:32:37] yes of course, it's just that a school teacher wrote a book in 1804 in which he explained a new, standard way of writing dutch, with VERY detailed arguments for why he thought so. Then some 50 years later a huge dictionary project (somewhat like the OED; now updated and freely searchable online) was started and they invented a somewhat different spelling, and the latter spelling has stuck
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:33:01] just like in english, before that spelling was pretty much different from individual to individual, and a bit of a mess
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:40:21] hm, now that I think about it, /ɪː/ only ever occurs before /r/, so it's 'eer' -> /ɪːr/, and all other instances of ee and free e (free as in, occurring in an open syllable) are /eː/
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:43:28] theriel: and yes, I live close to a hanseatic city
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:45:04] oh, I forgot /ɪːɫ/
2013-10-01 19:45:57	sytse	[00:45:40] but /ɪːɫ/ and /ɪːr/ have very different vowels.. hmm
2013-10-01 19:45:57	Covered	[00:52:28] :P
2013-10-01 19:45:57	crumb	[06:09:16] anyone willing to translate for btc?

2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:12:12] Hey all, anyone familiar with theta-criterion?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:13:16] What about Theta-Titanium? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGoISqcahM
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:14:40] Not quite what I was after but I at least have some new music to listen to hahaha
2013-10-01 19:45:57	 *	xybre [11:16:31] is now reading the theta-criteron articles on wikipedia and glottopedia
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:16:53] Glottopedia just has a little stub, not terribly helpful.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:17:00] "Theta Criterion: Every argument, e.g., NP, in a sentence must receive one and only one thematic role (e.g., agent, experiencer, theme, patient, goal, beneficiary); each thematic role associated with a theta-assigner (typically a verb) must be assigned to one and only one argument."
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:17:27] That's where I'm hitting my head against the wall.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:17:59] I sat through a lecture on this and it made sense at the time, but now when it comes time to implement it in an exercise set... I don't seem to have gotten things quite as well as I thought I had.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:18:14] It seems like there's a lack of information out there
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:19:13] Is it something your textbook author was just really into?
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:19:30] If by textbook author you mean professor, yes.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:19:42] So now I'm trying to make heads and tails out of what exactly they're after.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	Oladon1	[11:19:45] If you read Chinese, I've got a professor-written textbook that probably talks a good bit about it :P
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:20:09] Thankfully they would rather we try new things and get it wrong than just fail us.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:20:20] No Chinese ability here, sorry. Thanks though!
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:20:30] darkbox: check out the references in the wikipedia article
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:20:49] You can probably find ebook versions of them online, or the books themselves in the university library
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:20:54] That I'll do
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:21:12] Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures and Sobin, Nicholas (2011). Syntactic Analysis The Basics
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:23:05] Ye 'ole Chomsky. Pretty sure he's my professor's hero.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:23:29] And I mean that in a matter of fact way. Chomsky doesn't seem like he was off his rocker or whatever.
2013-10-01 19:45:57	xybre	[11:25:13] Chomsky is interesting
2013-10-01 19:45:57	darkbox	[11:50:07] Thanks for your help xybre, I think I got it figured out now

2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[16:30:26] sytse: be present could be an adequate translation, but is there a single verb for that concept?  We abuse our copula too much I think :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	dosereo	[19:19:28] can anyone give me a correct literation of "kalos ho pais" in koine?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	dosereo	[19:21:08] how many homeless people died today in your city?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:47:33] theriel: oh, a verb. Hmm, well, first off, I'm not sure if using multiple words when we want to add the additional indication of specificity of location to a verb with the meaning 'to exist' is abuse
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:47:33] :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:47:40] it was random grumbling, not serious, don't worry
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:48:01] just created some inconvenience when glossing
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:48:03] theriel: secondly, dutch doesn't have a common single verb for that either, and says 'be somewhere' as well
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:48:14] still, it piqued my interest :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:48:34] hrm, can't they use something like.. lagen?  laggen?  not sure what the cognate is :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:48:49] swedish can do that, and it doesn't just mean literally lying
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:48:53] I can't imagine there isn't a latin word *somewhere* in the english dictionary that has that meaning ;-)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:48:55] more like situate or such
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:49:02] hmm
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:50:44] didn't you just name the cognate? To lie? (dutch, liggen)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:50:57] ie, lie as in down, not about
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:51:14] (the latter is liegen in dutch)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:52:40] liegen, ah
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:53:08] yeah english can't use lie like that, german can use it to an extent, only with actual concrete things, and swedish can use it also for abstract/non-visible
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:53:16] (concrete things on a flat surface, that is)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:53:21] but uhm. Situate something else? Or be situated? In dutch, 'neerleggen' means to situate (usually an object, but 'zichzelf neerleggen', to situate oneself in a horizontal position, works as well)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:53:42] 'neer' means 'down' btw
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:53:53] neer?  not neder?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:54:22] neer was spelled with a ^ on the second e in the 19th century and before to indicate the dropping of d
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:54:25] so no
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:54:53] how about if you wanted to say that the eiffel tower is in paris?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:54:59] 'nederland' is an exception; in the 19th century, it was commonly 'neerland', but regressed to nederland somehow
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:55:02] can you use any other verb than to be?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:56:10] 'nederig' is another exception (cognate of niedrig, meaning 'humble', presumably from a literal sense of prostrating oneself)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:56:27] 'de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs'.. hmm, yes, that works
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:57:33] although it's very informal language
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:57:33] see, you have it too then
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:57:47] english is missing a similar construction
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:58:17] we also can't use "find oneself" or something similar
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[23:58:31] or well, in very very limited instances, to show surprise
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:59:31] in what meaning, exactly?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[23:59:35] (in swedish)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:00:58] also, english does use 'to sit' in that sense; it's sitting on the shelf, for example
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:01:06] german this time :D  to be somewhere
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:01:10] iirc
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:02:34] oh right.. not find (vinden) in dutch, but bevinden.. hmm. Bevinden is actually literally what you meant, so be situated somewhere. Interesting.. I didn't come up with that one earlier :S
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:02:45] de eiffeltoren bevindt zich in parijs, is the formal version of de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:03:30] (but that's not a single verb; even objects like the eiffel tower need to bevind 'oneself' in paris)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:04:06] well it's a reflexive verb, but it's just the syntactic construction
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:04:18] sure
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:04:19] towers can't find something.. they're not animate
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:04:52] but you can't say "the eiffel tower finds itself in paris" :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:04:54] 'bevinden' cannot be used transitively at all actually in modern language afaik, only reflexively
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:05:01] hehe
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:05:01] that means that it's doing soul searching and finally realize who it is
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:05:08] yep
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:05:36] you're just proving my point btw :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:05:48] even all the closest languages to english have something we don't :~
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:06:02] i realize english may have other constructions, but it was just this one that i was doing and feeling grumbly about
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:06:06] but you can say the eiffel tower located itself into paris.. which means it walked there on its giant steel feet
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:07:34] there is even a theory that the ancestral language of english is not old english at all but the language the vikings came in with btw :]
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:07:34] yeah i read that :)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:08:02] doesn't matter actually in this case, since the low and high german varieties in addition to the scandinavian varities all have these :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:08:35] i dunno though, hard to say for sure
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:08:59] although you get strange things anyhow when a different language is mixed in.. just like with humans; descended from apes, but pigs mixed in, supposedly
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:09:23] dutch/frisian are probably the easiest languages to understand, anyway, if you speak english
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:09:34] hm, really?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:09:37] even without studying dutch i'd probably pick it up in some weeks if i moved there
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:09:39] I've heard many people say otherwise
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:09:59] (I cannot possibly judge that for myself as it's my native tongue)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:10:31] the orthography isn't particularly intuitive, and the sound changes take some getting used to (g -> χ), but it's still pretty easy
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:10:45] hm, the orthography is very regular though
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:11:24] it was consciously redesigned one and a half century ago to correspond as closely as possible to pronunciation and to be easy to teach (by a schoolteacher)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:12:54] i think it was the diphthongs that i found rather unintuitive
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:13:59] ui isn't /yi/ or something, it's /æy/
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:14:37] and then there's the conflation of length with quality that all the germanic languages have, almost
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:14:38] sure.. and ei and ij merged in the 19th century
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:15:52] yes. And many other phenomena like that that you don't find in english.. but that's not really something you can blame on the orthography imho
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:16:13] sound changes?  i guess not
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:16:22] english was reasonably phonetic 1000 years ago :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:16:25] in its writing
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:17:34] we're just not known for be willing to adjust or redesign things to correspond to pronunciation
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:17:34] 'other phenomena like that' as in, changes to phonemes dependent on phonological context
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:18:49] ah, that's normal, i was thinking of historical rather than allophonic changes
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:19:00] historical changes are what mess people up
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:22:22] sure.. dutch only has 140 years of sound changes that mess up your understanding of the orthography, and the most important loss of vowel quality distinction got assimilated into the orthography after WW2
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:25:19] (there were two long 'e' sounds besides /ɪː/, one of which got written ee, the other e; this distinction got dropped from the orthography)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:25:59] but I'm sure there are thousands upon thousands of exceptions just like in any language :D
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:27:36] hrm, wasn't dutch written earlier than that?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:27:36] hmm. /ɪː/ is in neither the wikipedia article on dutch phonology, nor the article on dutch orthography
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:27:36] big omission
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:27:36] ('beer' as in, bear is pronounced with that)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	cntrational	[00:28:18] add it
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:28:24] i thought the netherlands was a big part of the hanseatic league
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:28:44] so i'd figure that there were older documents in dutch, from the 1400's, etc
2013-10-01 19:55:08	theriel	[00:31:26] hrm bbl
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:32:37] yes of course, it's just that a school teacher wrote a book in 1804 in which he explained a new, standard way of writing dutch, with VERY detailed arguments for why he thought so. Then some 50 years later a huge dictionary project (somewhat like the OED; now updated and freely searchable online) was started and they invented a somewhat different spelling, and the latter spelling has stuck
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:33:01] just like in english, before that spelling was pretty much different from individual to individual, and a bit of a mess
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:40:21] hm, now that I think about it, /ɪː/ only ever occurs before /r/, so it's 'eer' -> /ɪːr/, and all other instances of ee and free e (free as in, occurring in an open syllable) are /eː/
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:43:28] theriel: and yes, I live close to a hanseatic city
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:45:04] oh, I forgot /ɪːɫ/
2013-10-01 19:55:08	sytse	[00:45:40] but /ɪːɫ/ and /ɪːr/ have very different vowels.. hmm
2013-10-01 19:55:08	Covered	[00:52:28] :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:09:16] anyone willing to translate for btc?

2013-10-01 19:55:08	Roey	[06:16:12] hola crumb
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:16:23] are you up for the jerb?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:21:42] this place used to be a lot more active
2013-10-01 19:55:08	Roey	[06:40:46] crumb:  it's totally on-topic
2013-10-01 19:55:08	Roey	[06:40:59] crumb:  of course it's quieter than #linguistics (zoo)
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:50:15] ooh.. that's the channel i meant to go to :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:50:25] Roey: so you can't do translations?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	Roey	[06:50:44] not at the moment, phone
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[06:50:54] ok
2013-10-01 19:55:08	crumb	[08:56:44] Roey: are you off the phone yet?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	blue_pants	[10:02:48] http://www.theonion.com/articles/student-reporter-hits-it-out-of-the-park-with-5-ac,34033/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=LinkPreview:2:Default
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:12:12] Hey all, anyone familiar with theta-criterion?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:13:16] What about Theta-Titanium? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGoISqcahM
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:14:40] Not quite what I was after but I at least have some new music to listen to hahaha
2013-10-01 19:55:08	 *	xybre [11:16:31] is now reading the theta-criteron articles on wikipedia and glottopedia
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:16:53] Glottopedia just has a little stub, not terribly helpful.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:17:00] "Theta Criterion: Every argument, e.g., NP, in a sentence must receive one and only one thematic role (e.g., agent, experiencer, theme, patient, goal, beneficiary); each thematic role associated with a theta-assigner (typically a verb) must be assigned to one and only one argument."
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:17:27] That's where I'm hitting my head against the wall.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:17:59] I sat through a lecture on this and it made sense at the time, but now when it comes time to implement it in an exercise set... I don't seem to have gotten things quite as well as I thought I had.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:18:14] It seems like there's a lack of information out there
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:19:13] Is it something your textbook author was just really into?
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:19:30] If by textbook author you mean professor, yes.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:19:42] So now I'm trying to make heads and tails out of what exactly they're after.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	Oladon1	[11:19:45] If you read Chinese, I've got a professor-written textbook that probably talks a good bit about it :P
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:20:09] Thankfully they would rather we try new things and get it wrong than just fail us.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:20:20] No Chinese ability here, sorry. Thanks though!
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:20:30] darkbox: check out the references in the wikipedia article
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:20:49] You can probably find ebook versions of them online, or the books themselves in the university library
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:20:54] That I'll do
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:21:12] Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures and Sobin, Nicholas (2011). Syntactic Analysis The Basics
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:23:05] Ye 'ole Chomsky. Pretty sure he's my professor's hero.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:23:29] And I mean that in a matter of fact way. Chomsky doesn't seem like he was off his rocker or whatever.
2013-10-01 19:55:08	xybre	[11:25:13] Chomsky is interesting
2013-10-01 19:55:08	darkbox	[11:50:07] Thanks for your help xybre, I think I got it figured out now

2013-10-03 20:24:28	theriel	you do realize that google is less and less consistent when it comes to results you get?
2013-10-03 20:24:49	yano	they have been like that for years
2013-10-03 20:24:59	yano	ever since they made results based on location
2013-10-03 20:25:09	Twey	Yes, it's annoying; I keep switching to DDG then forgetting
2013-10-03 20:25:13	theriel	location, OS, and god knows how many other things

2013-10-03 21:08:57	theriel	although i also remember some indian programmers going nuts at the idea of gender in a language, when i was working for nokia.. which i didn't understand because most of them had a gender system in their mother tongue
2013-10-03 21:09:15	theriel	but they just kept on thinking that "everything must be like english" somehow
2013-10-03 21:13:49	Twey	‘Going nuts’ how?  Being confused at the concept of a language having gender?  Not wanting to accommodate gender in the software?
2013-10-03 21:16:22	theriel	hard coding the text without an ability to insert more than one option depending on the text around it
2013-10-03 21:16:33	theriel	and then getting floored that this might be necessary
2013-10-03 21:16:34	Twey	Ick
2013-10-03 21:16:43	theriel	when their own languages would need to do the same
2013-10-03 21:17:38	Twey	I wonder whether we'll ever see more advanced internationalization facilities become standard (like embedding GF in programs/build processes)
2013-10-03 21:18:11	Twey	Or if we've reached a local maximum and will stay there for the foreseeable future
2013-10-03 21:28:28	cntrational	odd
2013-10-03 21:29:10	cntrational	especially even since something basic like "I speak Hindi" varies by gender in Hindi

2013-10-03 21:56:07	theriel	as far as i know most of the northern indic languages do
2013-10-03 21:56:15	theriel	ok, so then there probably aren't that many which don't
2013-10-03 21:56:24	cntrational	tamil and telugu have three genders
2013-10-03 21:56:42	theriel	*sigh*.. i think it's just a matter of ignorance about language then
2013-10-03 21:56:46	theriel	they probably just didn't think about it
2013-10-03 21:57:12	cntrational	I think Dravidian genders are naturally based, though, rather than arbitrarily
2013-10-03 21:57:36	cntrational	i.e., based on actual gender instead of grammatical gender, like how English pronouns usually work
2013-10-03 22:00:46	theriel	so they don't have gender for inanimate objects?

2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[16:30:26] sytse: be present could be an adequate translation, but is there a single verb for that concept?  We abuse our copula too much I think :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	dosereo	[19:19:28] can anyone give me a correct literation of "kalos ho pais" in koine?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	dosereo	[19:21:08] how many homeless people died today in your city?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:47:33] theriel: oh, a verb. Hmm, well, first off, I'm not sure if using multiple words when we want to add the additional indication of specificity of location to a verb with the meaning 'to exist' is abuse
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:47:33] :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:47:40] it was random grumbling, not serious, don't worry
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:48:01] just created some inconvenience when glossing
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:48:03] theriel: secondly, dutch doesn't have a common single verb for that either, and says 'be somewhere' as well
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:48:14] still, it piqued my interest :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:48:34] hrm, can't they use something like.. lagen?  laggen?  not sure what the cognate is :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:48:49] swedish can do that, and it doesn't just mean literally lying
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:48:53] I can't imagine there isn't a latin word *somewhere* in the english dictionary that has that meaning ;-)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:48:55] more like situate or such
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:49:02] hmm
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:50:44] didn't you just name the cognate? To lie? (dutch, liggen)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:50:57] ie, lie as in down, not about
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:51:14] (the latter is liegen in dutch)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:52:40] liegen, ah
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:53:08] yeah english can't use lie like that, german can use it to an extent, only with actual concrete things, and swedish can use it also for abstract/non-visible
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:53:16] (concrete things on a flat surface, that is)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:53:21] but uhm. Situate something else? Or be situated? In dutch, 'neerleggen' means to situate (usually an object, but 'zichzelf neerleggen', to situate oneself in a horizontal position, works as well)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:53:42] 'neer' means 'down' btw
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:53:53] neer?  not neder?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:54:22] neer was spelled with a ^ on the second e in the 19th century and before to indicate the dropping of d
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:54:25] so no
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:54:53] how about if you wanted to say that the eiffel tower is in paris?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:54:59] 'nederland' is an exception; in the 19th century, it was commonly 'neerland', but regressed to nederland somehow
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:55:02] can you use any other verb than to be?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:56:10] 'nederig' is another exception (cognate of niedrig, meaning 'humble', presumably from a literal sense of prostrating oneself)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:56:27] 'de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs'.. hmm, yes, that works
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:57:33] although it's very informal language
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:57:33] see, you have it too then
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:57:47] english is missing a similar construction
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:58:17] we also can't use "find oneself" or something similar
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[23:58:31] or well, in very very limited instances, to show surprise
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:59:31] in what meaning, exactly?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[23:59:35] (in swedish)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:00:58] also, english does use 'to sit' in that sense; it's sitting on the shelf, for example
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:01:06] german this time :D  to be somewhere
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:01:10] iirc
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:02:34] oh right.. not find (vinden) in dutch, but bevinden.. hmm. Bevinden is actually literally what you meant, so be situated somewhere. Interesting.. I didn't come up with that one earlier :S
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:02:45] de eiffeltoren bevindt zich in parijs, is the formal version of de eiffeltoren ligt in parijs
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:03:30] (but that's not a single verb; even objects like the eiffel tower need to bevind 'oneself' in paris)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:04:06] well it's a reflexive verb, but it's just the syntactic construction
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:04:18] sure
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:04:19] towers can't find something.. they're not animate
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:04:52] but you can't say "the eiffel tower finds itself in paris" :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:04:54] 'bevinden' cannot be used transitively at all actually in modern language afaik, only reflexively
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:05:01] hehe
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:05:01] that means that it's doing soul searching and finally realize who it is
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:05:08] yep
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:05:36] you're just proving my point btw :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:05:48] even all the closest languages to english have something we don't :~
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:06:02] i realize english may have other constructions, but it was just this one that i was doing and feeling grumbly about
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:06:06] but you can say the eiffel tower located itself into paris.. which means it walked there on its giant steel feet
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:07:34] there is even a theory that the ancestral language of english is not old english at all but the language the vikings came in with btw :]
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:07:34] yeah i read that :)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:08:02] doesn't matter actually in this case, since the low and high german varieties in addition to the scandinavian varities all have these :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:08:35] i dunno though, hard to say for sure
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:08:59] although you get strange things anyhow when a different language is mixed in.. just like with humans; descended from apes, but pigs mixed in, supposedly
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:09:23] dutch/frisian are probably the easiest languages to understand, anyway, if you speak english
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:09:34] hm, really?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:09:37] even without studying dutch i'd probably pick it up in some weeks if i moved there
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:09:39] I've heard many people say otherwise
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:09:59] (I cannot possibly judge that for myself as it's my native tongue)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:10:31] the orthography isn't particularly intuitive, and the sound changes take some getting used to (g -> χ), but it's still pretty easy
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:10:45] hm, the orthography is very regular though
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:11:24] it was consciously redesigned one and a half century ago to correspond as closely as possible to pronunciation and to be easy to teach (by a schoolteacher)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:12:54] i think it was the diphthongs that i found rather unintuitive
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:13:59] ui isn't /yi/ or something, it's /æy/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:14:37] and then there's the conflation of length with quality that all the germanic languages have, almost
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:14:38] sure.. and ei and ij merged in the 19th century
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:15:52] yes. And many other phenomena like that that you don't find in english.. but that's not really something you can blame on the orthography imho
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:16:13] sound changes?  i guess not
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:16:22] english was reasonably phonetic 1000 years ago :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:16:25] in its writing
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:17:34] we're just not known for be willing to adjust or redesign things to correspond to pronunciation
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:17:34] 'other phenomena like that' as in, changes to phonemes dependent on phonological context
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:18:49] ah, that's normal, i was thinking of historical rather than allophonic changes
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:19:00] historical changes are what mess people up
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:22:22] sure.. dutch only has 140 years of sound changes that mess up your understanding of the orthography, and the most important loss of vowel quality distinction got assimilated into the orthography after WW2
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:25:19] (there were two long 'e' sounds besides /ɪː/, one of which got written ee, the other e; this distinction got dropped from the orthography)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:25:59] but I'm sure there are thousands upon thousands of exceptions just like in any language :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:27:36] hrm, wasn't dutch written earlier than that?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:27:36] hmm. /ɪː/ is in neither the wikipedia article on dutch phonology, nor the article on dutch orthography
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:27:36] big omission
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:27:36] ('beer' as in, bear is pronounced with that)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[00:28:18] add it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:28:24] i thought the netherlands was a big part of the hanseatic league
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:28:44] so i'd figure that there were older documents in dutch, from the 1400's, etc
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[00:31:26] hrm bbl
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:32:37] yes of course, it's just that a school teacher wrote a book in 1804 in which he explained a new, standard way of writing dutch, with VERY detailed arguments for why he thought so. Then some 50 years later a huge dictionary project (somewhat like the OED; now updated and freely searchable online) was started and they invented a somewhat different spelling, and the latter spelling has stuck
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:33:01] just like in english, before that spelling was pretty much different from individual to individual, and a bit of a mess
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:40:21] hm, now that I think about it, /ɪː/ only ever occurs before /r/, so it's 'eer' -> /ɪːr/, and all other instances of ee and free e (free as in, occurring in an open syllable) are /eː/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:43:28] theriel: and yes, I live close to a hanseatic city
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:45:04] oh, I forgot /ɪːɫ/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	sytse	[00:45:40] but /ɪːɫ/ and /ɪːr/ have very different vowels.. hmm
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Covered	[00:52:28] :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:09:16] anyone willing to translate for btc?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	kimspindel	[06:09:39] which languages?

2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:16:12] hola crumb
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:16:23] are you up for the jerb?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:21:42] this place used to be a lot more active
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:40:46] crumb:  it's totally on-topic
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:40:59] crumb:  of course it's quieter than #linguistics (zoo)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:50:15] ooh.. that's the channel i meant to go to :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:50:25] Roey: so you can't do translations?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:50:44] not at the moment, phone
2013-10-06 09:57:39	crumb	[06:50:54] ok

2013-10-06 09:57:39	blue_pants	[10:02:48] http://www.theonion.com/articles/student-reporter-hits-it-out-of-the-park-with-5-ac,34033/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=LinkPreview:2:Default
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:12:12] Hey all, anyone familiar with theta-criterion?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:13:16] What about Theta-Titanium? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGoISqcahM
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:14:40] Not quite what I was after but I at least have some new music to listen to hahaha
2013-10-06 09:57:39	 *	xybre [11:16:31] is now reading the theta-criteron articles on wikipedia and glottopedia
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:16:53] Glottopedia just has a little stub, not terribly helpful.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:17:00] "Theta Criterion: Every argument, e.g., NP, in a sentence must receive one and only one thematic role (e.g., agent, experiencer, theme, patient, goal, beneficiary); each thematic role associated with a theta-assigner (typically a verb) must be assigned to one and only one argument."
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:17:27] That's where I'm hitting my head against the wall.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:17:59] I sat through a lecture on this and it made sense at the time, but now when it comes time to implement it in an exercise set... I don't seem to have gotten things quite as well as I thought I had.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:18:14] It seems like there's a lack of information out there
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:19:13] Is it something your textbook author was just really into?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:19:30] If by textbook author you mean professor, yes.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:19:42] So now I'm trying to make heads and tails out of what exactly they're after.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Oladon1	[11:19:45] If you read Chinese, I've got a professor-written textbook that probably talks a good bit about it :P
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:20:09] Thankfully they would rather we try new things and get it wrong than just fail us.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:20:20] No Chinese ability here, sorry. Thanks though!
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:20:30] darkbox: check out the references in the wikipedia article
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:20:49] You can probably find ebook versions of them online, or the books themselves in the university library
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:20:54] That I'll do
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:21:12] Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures and Sobin, Nicholas (2011). Syntactic Analysis The Basics
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:23:05] Ye 'ole Chomsky. Pretty sure he's my professor's hero.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:23:29] And I mean that in a matter of fact way. Chomsky doesn't seem like he was off his rocker or whatever.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[11:25:13] Chomsky is interesting
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[11:50:07] Thanks for your help xybre, I think I got it figured out now
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:46:35] hello all
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:46:53] did the surname "Roth" come from "Ruth" which is from the Hebrew "Rut"
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:46:55] ?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:47:01] in other words
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:47:06] Rpth = Ruth = רוט
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:47:12] er
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:47:14] nevermind
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[06:47:16] רות
2013-10-06 09:57:39	darkbox	[08:05:12] Anyone here today had any experience with theta theory?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[18:50:40] There was a paper a while back on representing a lexicon as a vector space; does anybody remember what it was called?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	space	[18:52:41] Try asking in #linguistics.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[18:59:47] I'll… I'll *try*…
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[19:01:57] Oh yeah I saw that too Twey, I am drawing a complete blank on it unfortunately
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[19:04:57] Unfortunately searching anything to do with ‘vector space’ in linguistics floods you with information retrieval
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[19:12:19] http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/structuredVS.pdf ?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[19:13:37] xybre: I think this is it!  Thank you!
2013-10-06 09:57:39	xybre	[19:18:20] Yay! It was the first hit for me on Google. My Google-fu is strong. @_@
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[19:56:01] xybre: What did you search?  O.O
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[20:11:07] ?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[20:24:28] you do realize that google is less and less consistent when it comes to results you get?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	yano	[20:24:49] they have been like that for years
2013-10-06 09:57:39	yano	[20:24:59] ever since they made results based on location
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[20:25:09] Yes, it's annoying; I keep switching to DDG then forgetting
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[20:25:13] location, OS, and god knows how many other things
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[20:25:33] when i was under windows 8 i simply couldn't find a bunch of programs i needed which immediately showed up under linux
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[20:25:45] same computer, same location, same everything else, and i was even logged in with my account
2013-10-06 09:57:39	yano	[20:27:37] heh
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[20:29:19] one thing i'd love to be able to do is get google to not strip out what they consider "punctuation marks" even inside quotes.. nothing from the khoisan languages has ever been really googleable
2013-10-06 09:57:39	yano	[20:29:44] they don'teven use quotes correctly
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Roey	[20:36:03] yano:  hello, fancy meeting you here
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[21:06:18] theriel: They ignore diacritics too.  It's very frustrating.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:08:06] americans :D
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:08:15] (i'm american myself so i can say that)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:08:57] although i also remember some indian programmers going nuts at the idea of gender in a language, when i was working for nokia.. which i didn't understand because most of them had a gender system in their mother tongue
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:09:15] but they just kept on thinking that "everything must be like english" somehow
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[21:13:49] ‘Going nuts’ how?  Being confused at the concept of a language having gender?  Not wanting to accommodate gender in the software?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:16:22] hard coding the text without an ability to insert more than one option depending on the text around it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:16:33] and then getting floored that this might be necessary
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[21:16:34] Ick
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:16:43] when their own languages would need to do the same
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[21:17:38] I wonder whether we'll ever see more advanced internationalization facilities become standard (like embedding GF in programs/build processes)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	Twey	[21:18:11] Or if we've reached a local maximum and will stay there for the foreseeable future
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:28:28] odd
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:29:10] especially even since something basic like "I speak Hindi" varies by gender in Hindi
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:55:58] cntrational: I don't know what was their mother tongue.. do dravidian languages have gender?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:56:06] yes
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:56:07] as far as i know most of the northern indic languages do
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:56:15] ok, so then there probably aren't that many which don't
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:56:24] tamil and telugu have three genders
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:56:42] *sigh*.. i think it's just a matter of ignorance about language then
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[21:56:46] they probably just didn't think about it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:57:12] I think Dravidian genders are naturally based, though, rather than arbitrarily
2013-10-06 09:57:39	cntrational	[21:57:36] i.e., based on actual gender instead of grammatical gender, like how English pronouns usually work
2013-10-06 09:57:39	theriel	[22:00:46] so they don't have gender for inanimate objects?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:57:07] hi
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:57:12] Is the English slang word "chick" (meaning: young human female) descended from:
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:57:13] English slang "hen" (meaning: human female) ( the child of a "hen" (female poultry) is "chick" )
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:57:13] Spanish word "chica" (young female)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:58:55] I only speak New York English.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	benuphoenix	[03:59:15] long island dialect

2013-10-10 04:24:35	nisstyre	(that is the context)
2013-10-10 04:24:49	nisstyre	I think it should be clear
2013-10-10 04:25:00	nisstyre	just wanted to run it by someone else
2013-10-10 04:25:16	cntrational	yeah, i think it should be fine
2013-10-10 04:25:27	cntrational	BUT
2013-10-10 04:26:19	cntrational	"phonation" can refer to the mechanism of the sound production too, i think (like pulmonic or implosive or whatever) -- but i think that shouldn't matter in this context
2013-10-10 04:26:33	nisstyre	cntrational: yeah, it should be fairly clear
2013-10-10 04:29:55	cntrational	yeah, just being clear
2013-10-10 04:40:58	lorenzo	I know it's a broad question, but what are the mechanisms that allow us to map a sound to a certain word?
2013-10-10 04:41:33	lorenzo	I mean, is there some sort of fourier transform or anything like that going on in background?
2013-10-10 04:43:09	cntrational	i'm not sure what you mean
2013-10-10 04:51:53	lorenzo	cntrational, e.g.
2013-10-10 04:51:59	lorenzo	I hear a child saying "cosa"
2013-10-10 04:52:24	lorenzo	actually, due to the higher frequencies, it's "casa"
2013-10-10 04:52:33	lorenzo	but still my mind maps it correctly to "cosa"
2013-10-10 04:52:52	lorenzo	because I adapt how I receive information to the context and to the emitter
2013-10-10 04:54:16	cntrational	so, you mean how the mind maps a certain sound to a certain phoneme?
2013-10-10 04:54:33	lorenzo	cntrational, yeah exactly
2013-10-10 04:54:49	lorenzo	I lack the jargon, it's my third or fourth linguistics lesson I get :P
2013-10-10 04:55:09	cntrational	hmm, i don't really know how the neuropsychological aspect of phonetics works
2013-10-10 04:57:24	lorenzo	also cntrational another question, you know there is a subdivision
2013-10-10 04:57:45	lorenzo	in paradigmatic axis (vertical) and syntagmatic (horizontal)
2013-10-10 04:57:56	lorenzo	does this apply to all levels of linguistic analysis?
2013-10-10 04:58:38	lorenzo	phonems, morphems, up to the semantics?
2013-10-10 04:58:58	cntrational	paradigmatic as in...? verb and noun paradigms and stuff?
2013-10-10 04:59:23	lorenzo	no, I mean the paradigmatic axis from which you choose the single element to use, with exclusivity
2013-10-10 04:59:34	lorenzo	e.g.
2013-10-10 04:59:38	lorenzo	I do x
2013-10-10 04:59:40	lorenzo	I   y
2013-10-10 04:59:42	lorenzo	etc
2013-10-10 05:01:33	cntrational	i'm mostly self-taught in linguistics, so uh i don't really know what bit you're talking about <.<
2013-10-10 05:01:54	lorenzo	oh ok
2013-10-10 05:02:07	lorenzo	I'm using the manual for my course and it's all but clear :D
2013-10-10 05:02:32	cntrational	ask your professor or something, i guess? :p
2013-10-10 05:03:00	lorenzo	impossibru
2013-10-10 05:03:11	lorenzo	she arrives 15 minutes late
2013-10-10 05:03:16	lorenzo	and goes away 15 early :P
2013-10-10 05:03:43	cntrational	lol
2013-10-10 05:09:08	nisstyre	lorenzo: look up speech perception
2013-10-10 05:09:17	nisstyre	there's a lot of psychological research and neurological research
2013-10-10 05:09:34	nisstyre	I'm taking psycholinguistics right now and we just finished talking about it
2013-10-10 05:09:56	lorenzo	nice, I have psycholinguistics next year but for some stuff you just can't wait :)
2013-10-10 05:10:58	lorenzo	nisstyre, okay thanks I'm looking up speech perception, what I also miss is the jargon as I said
2013-10-10 05:11:03	lorenzo	so what word describes what phenomena
2013-10-10 05:11:04	nisstyre	lorenzo: also fourier transforms are more to do with acoustics
2013-10-10 05:11:30	nisstyre	i.e. what happens when your vocal tract produces a sound
2013-10-10 05:11:39	nisstyre	and it gets transmitted through the air as a sound
2013-10-10 05:12:12	nisstyre	well, I don't want to say the acoustics = what happens when you produce it with your vocal tract
2013-10-10 05:12:20	nisstyre	it's the product of your vocal tract though
2013-10-10 05:12:24	lorenzo	I see
2013-10-10 05:12:34	nisstyre	articulation is what you do to produce it
2013-10-10 05:12:44	nisstyre	make sense more or less?
2013-10-10 05:12:51	lorenzo	yeah
2013-10-10 05:12:54	nisstyre	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_phonetics
2013-10-10 05:13:01	lorenzo	we're doing fonetica articolatoria, articulatory phonetics
2013-10-10 05:13:47	nisstyre	lorenzo: this book might be helpful to you later http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Information-Theory-Mathematics/dp/0486240614/ref=pd_sim_b_1
2013-10-10 05:15:15	lorenzo	bookmarked
2013-10-10 05:15:27	nisstyre	lorenzo: also the psychological aspect of how deaf people perceive sign language is very similar to how people perceive speech sounds
2013-10-10 05:15:45	nisstyre	obviously the actual medium is different (how it gets transmitted)
2013-10-10 05:16:04	lorenzo	yeah what I noticed is that the receiver plays an active role
2013-10-10 05:16:20	lorenzo	by somehow shifting his expectations of what he is going to hear
2013-10-10 05:17:17	lorenzo	on a signifier level, I mean, when you approach somebody you already know more or less what kind of voice he is going to have and get ready for it unconsciously
2013-10-10 05:17:51	nisstyre	lorenzo: well it might act as a contextual cue to help you better perceive their speech
2013-10-10 05:18:00	nisstyre	same as looking at their lips, face, etc...
2013-10-10 05:18:06	nisstyre	hand gestures
2013-10-10 05:18:54	lorenzo	that's studied in pragmatics?
2013-10-10 05:19:32	nisstyre	pragmatics yeah, and maybe sociolinguistics
2013-10-10 05:19:42	lorenzo	yeah, I should probably finish the manual first
2013-10-10 05:19:46	lorenzo	before getting into the different fields
2013-10-10 05:19:56	nisstyre	although sociolinguistics isn't really about one on one interaction afaik
2013-10-10 05:21:10	lorenzo	problem with my university right now is that literature exams are taking over 90% of my time :D
2013-10-10 05:22:05	nisstyre	lorenzo: I never took any English classes and don't plan on it
2013-10-10 05:22:17	nisstyre	I am required to take some foreign language courses though
2013-10-10 05:23:00	lorenzo	nisstyre, I'm required to take 2 foreign languages
2013-10-10 05:23:11	nisstyre	lorenzo: damn, that's way fewer than me
2013-10-10 05:23:19	lorenzo	for 3 years, and at the first year (current), all the literatures for such languages
2013-10-10 05:23:37	nisstyre	I'm way more interested in the scientific aspects of linguistics
2013-10-10 05:23:40	lorenzo	from the second year I'll only do linguistics related exams + 2 languages (always the same)
2013-10-10 05:23:40	nisstyre	well, that's what it is
2013-10-10 05:23:43	lorenzo	exactly
2013-10-10 05:23:47	nisstyre	the foreign language requirements are dumb imo
2013-10-10 05:23:59	lorenzo	meh, I find the spanish classes relaxing
2013-10-10 05:24:06	nisstyre	if I wanted to sit and memorize latin words I would be a masochist on my own time
2013-10-10 05:24:21	lorenzo	I'm taking spanish and english and won't change them
2013-10-10 05:25:23	lorenzo	nisstyre, what bores me most is literature anyway, next exam will be on Moby Dick, and I'm studying the different meaning of a coin that is stuck on the mast of the damn boat
2013-10-10 05:25:52	lorenzo	*meanings
2013-10-10 05:26:02	lorenzo	totally useless sadly

2013-10-12 01:21:27	YaRly	Is this ok to write: "Why do they get afraid when they see a tiger, especially if they have weapons?" or do I need to change the punctuation?
2013-10-12 01:21:53	YaRly	I'm not quite sure about how to use question marks in situations like these...
2013-10-12 01:23:01	lorenzo	YaRly, sounds fine to me, it opens with Why
2013-10-12 01:23:10	lorenzo	you wouldn't need it in "I wonder why do they get afraid ..."
2013-10-12 01:23:26	lorenzo	but I'm not a native english speaker, so try ##English to be sure
2013-10-12 01:23:54	YaRly	lorenzo: yea, but the second phrase (that ends the sentence) isn't a question, I'm not 100% sure about it
2013-10-12 01:24:08	YaRly	allrite, posted the question there too
2013-10-12 01:24:39	lorenzo	YaRly, "Why do they get X, especially if they have Y?"
2013-10-12 01:24:42	lorenzo	maybe the length confuses you
2013-10-12 01:25:08	lorenzo	or turn it around, Knowing that they have Y, why do they get X? :P
2013-10-12 01:25:27	lorenzo	language is creative
2013-10-12 01:27:10	YaRly	Hmmm... I see, I think you're right though, it's fine the way it is.
2013-10-12 01:27:12	YaRly	Thanks mate!

2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[21:05:59] hi!
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[21:06:17] the syntagmatic axis / paradigmatic axis distinction
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[21:06:27] does it apply to all analysis levels of language?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[21:06:35] I mean phonetics, morphology, syntax and semantics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	synaesthetik	[23:29:29] hello
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[02:09:13] http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0027971
2013-10-15 11:12:37	clayjar	[02:49:26] 123 male college students??  I don't know if they're going to be a good group to target a research on. I think you can derive to a similar conclusion by analyzing speech via Ventrilo servers...
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[02:53:59] two participants who self-reported a homosexual orientation were excluded from the data analysis.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[02:54:00] :<
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[06:46:48] anyone here?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[06:47:20] question about what part of speech I should put "a" in "This book by a famous astronomer" for a sentence tree diagram
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[06:50:15] hrm. i'll leave it as a determiner
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[07:01:41] okay new question, how do I show possessives in trees? I have "Bill's friend from college" (before the T') and I can't figure out how I would show "Bill's friend" under an NP
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[07:01:55] 's is a clitic
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[07:02:00] so treat it separately
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[07:02:14] what should I call the category?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[07:02:16] CL?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[07:03:29] uh, not sure
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Parth	[07:14:37] T_T
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:18:50] Is "phonation" equivalent to "vocal fold vibration" for all intents and purposes? (when discussing phonetics)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:19:15] or will I be possibly misunderstood if I use it like that?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:22:48] nisstyre: hmm, sure, but only in the context where it's clear you mean voicing
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:24:27] cntrational: when discussing VOT?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:24:35] (that is the context)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:24:49] I think it should be clear
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:25:00] just wanted to run it by someone else
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:25:16] yeah, i think it should be fine
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:25:27] BUT
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:26:19] "phonation" can refer to the mechanism of the sound production too, i think (like pulmonic or implosive or whatever) -- but i think that shouldn't matter in this context
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[04:26:33] cntrational: yeah, it should be fairly clear
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:29:55] yeah, just being clear
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:40:58] I know it's a broad question, but what are the mechanisms that allow us to map a sound to a certain word?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:41:33] I mean, is there some sort of fourier transform or anything like that going on in background?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:43:09] i'm not sure what you mean
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:51:53] cntrational, e.g.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:51:59] I hear a child saying "cosa"
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:52:24] actually, due to the higher frequencies, it's "casa"
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:52:33] but still my mind maps it correctly to "cosa"
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:52:52] because I adapt how I receive information to the context and to the emitter
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:54:16] so, you mean how the mind maps a certain sound to a certain phoneme?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:54:33] cntrational, yeah exactly
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:54:49] I lack the jargon, it's my third or fourth linguistics lesson I get :P
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:55:09] hmm, i don't really know how the neuropsychological aspect of phonetics works
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:57:24] also cntrational another question, you know there is a subdivision
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:57:45] in paradigmatic axis (vertical) and syntagmatic (horizontal)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:57:56] does this apply to all levels of linguistic analysis?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:58:38] phonems, morphems, up to the semantics?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[04:58:58] paradigmatic as in...? verb and noun paradigms and stuff?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:59:23] no, I mean the paradigmatic axis from which you choose the single element to use, with exclusivity
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:59:34] e.g.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:59:38] I do x
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:59:40] I   y
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[04:59:42] etc
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[05:01:33] i'm mostly self-taught in linguistics, so uh i don't really know what bit you're talking about <.<
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:01:54] oh ok
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:02:07] I'm using the manual for my course and it's all but clear :D
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[05:02:32] ask your professor or something, i guess? :p
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:03:00] impossibru
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:03:11] she arrives 15 minutes late
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:03:16] and goes away 15 early :P
2013-10-15 11:12:37	cntrational	[05:03:43] lol
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:09:08] lorenzo: look up speech perception
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:09:17] there's a lot of psychological research and neurological research
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:09:34] I'm taking psycholinguistics right now and we just finished talking about it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:09:56] nice, I have psycholinguistics next year but for some stuff you just can't wait :)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:10:58] nisstyre, okay thanks I'm looking up speech perception, what I also miss is the jargon as I said
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:11:03] so what word describes what phenomena
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:11:04] lorenzo: also fourier transforms are more to do with acoustics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:11:30] i.e. what happens when your vocal tract produces a sound
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:11:39] and it gets transmitted through the air as a sound
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:12:12] well, I don't want to say the acoustics = what happens when you produce it with your vocal tract
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:12:20] it's the product of your vocal tract though
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:12:24] I see
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:12:34] articulation is what you do to produce it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:12:44] make sense more or less?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:12:51] yeah
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:12:54] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_phonetics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:13:01] we're doing fonetica articolatoria, articulatory phonetics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:13:47] lorenzo: this book might be helpful to you later http://www.amazon.com/An-Introduction-Information-Theory-Mathematics/dp/0486240614/ref=pd_sim_b_1
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:15:15] bookmarked
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:15:27] lorenzo: also the psychological aspect of how deaf people perceive sign language is very similar to how people perceive speech sounds
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:15:45] obviously the actual medium is different (how it gets transmitted)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:16:04] yeah what I noticed is that the receiver plays an active role
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:16:20] by somehow shifting his expectations of what he is going to hear
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:17:17] on a signifier level, I mean, when you approach somebody you already know more or less what kind of voice he is going to have and get ready for it unconsciously
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:17:51] lorenzo: well it might act as a contextual cue to help you better perceive their speech
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:18:00] same as looking at their lips, face, etc...
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:18:06] hand gestures
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:18:54] that's studied in pragmatics?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:19:32] pragmatics yeah, and maybe sociolinguistics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:19:42] yeah, I should probably finish the manual first
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:19:46] before getting into the different fields
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:19:56] although sociolinguistics isn't really about one on one interaction afaik
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:21:10] problem with my university right now is that literature exams are taking over 90% of my time :D
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:22:05] lorenzo: I never took any English classes and don't plan on it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:22:17] I am required to take some foreign language courses though
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:23:00] nisstyre, I'm required to take 2 foreign languages
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:23:11] lorenzo: damn, that's way fewer than me
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:23:19] for 3 years, and at the first year (current), all the literatures for such languages
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:23:37] I'm way more interested in the scientific aspects of linguistics
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:23:40] from the second year I'll only do linguistics related exams + 2 languages (always the same)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:23:40] well, that's what it is
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:23:43] exactly
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:23:47] the foreign language requirements are dumb imo
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:23:59] meh, I find the spanish classes relaxing
2013-10-15 11:12:37	nisstyre	[05:24:06] if I wanted to sit and memorize latin words I would be a masochist on my own time
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:24:21] I'm taking spanish and english and won't change them
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:25:23] nisstyre, what bores me most is literature anyway, next exam will be on Moby Dick, and I'm studying the different meaning of a coin that is stuck on the mast of the damn boat
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:25:52] *meanings
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[05:26:02] totally useless sadly
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[06:15:47] 'night and thanks again nisstyre
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:21:27] Is this ok to write: "Why do they get afraid when they see a tiger, especially if they have weapons?" or do I need to change the punctuation?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:21:53] I'm not quite sure about how to use question marks in situations like these...
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:23:01] YaRly, sounds fine to me, it opens with Why
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:23:10] you wouldn't need it in "I wonder why do they get afraid ..."
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:23:26] but I'm not a native english speaker, so try ##English to be sure
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:23:54] lorenzo: yea, but the second phrase (that ends the sentence) isn't a question, I'm not 100% sure about it
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:24:08] allrite, posted the question there too
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:24:39] YaRly, "Why do they get X, especially if they have Y?"
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:24:42] maybe the length confuses you
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:25:08] or turn it around, Knowing that they have Y, why do they get X? :P
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:25:27] language is creative
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:27:10] Hmmm... I see, I think you're right though, it's fine the way it is.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	YaRly	[01:27:12] Thanks mate!
2013-10-15 11:12:37	lorenzo	[01:27:27] no problem
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[08:41:04] Anybody an expert on abstract case marking / theta roll assigning?

2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:11:55] Anyone especially pedantic?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:17:58] I'm sure someone is.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:46:06] That's almost the answer I was looking for. ^^
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:46:20] Thanks @Leftmost
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:46:35] Glad to be of service.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:47:29] Maybe you can be of further service; have you any experience with syntactic trees?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:50:33] I do.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:53:19] Great. What would you interpret to be "an empty category" on a tree diagram? Would that simply be an ignored component of, say, an element. (E.g. the oft ignored "AUX")
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:53:54] ... or would that be something more akin to a D-structure subject? (E.g. "big PRO")
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:54:39] Using Government & Binding?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:54:59] That's the lens I'm looking at this, yes.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:55:23] *at this through
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:55:59] I'm unsure how to interpret "empty categories," but I wonder if I myself am simply being too pedantic.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:56:04] And the Empty Category Principle isn't what you're after? It's been a little while since I last looked at syntax, so I'm a bit rusty. May need more context.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:56:57] That's exactly what I was getting at, actually, with big PRO.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[10:57:30] However for the scope of the work I'm being asked to do, I wonder if I'm reading too far into the directions. Or if I'm actually just interpreting them correctly.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[10:59:35] It's my experience that GB is pretty rigorously-defined. I can't say that everything in the theory is, as there's a lot there and it's been a while, but if the terminology is being used correctly, then "empty category" should be used only as written in the definition.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[11:01:09] I'll check back for any references in the coursework to the principle. To the best of my memory, anything that is referenced is usually capitalized to distinguish it from any other potential implementation.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[11:01:29] (And in this case, I was asked about "empty categories" and not "Empty Categories.")
2013-10-15 11:12:37	darkbox	[11:01:36] Thanks for your help, though! That was useful.
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Leftmost	[11:02:40] Glad I could be of some use.

2013-10-27 19:37:14	TheLastofJoel	So, is this channel about Saussure's work and so on? I'm a linguistic (first year) student

2013-10-27 19:58:16	Leftmost	Anything linguistics-related is fair game here.
2013-10-27 19:58:52	TheLastofJoel	what do you mean?
2013-10-27 20:00:56	TheLastofJoel	I know that the subject is linguistics, obviously, but I was actually expecting a bunch of people speaking. Not a silent chat
2013-10-27 20:01:24	Leftmost	The channel tends to be fairly quiet, but there are discussions from time to time.

2013-10-27 20:02:24	TheLastofJoel	I understand
2013-10-27 20:03:59	lorenzo	hi TheLastofJoel
2013-10-27 20:04:03	lorenzo	I'm a first year student too :D
2013-10-27 20:05:03	TheLastofJoel	hi lorenzo :) Glad to hear that! I'm actually in France, so I don't know if we have the same subjects.
2013-10-27 20:05:34	lorenzo	I doubt that
2013-10-27 20:06:10	TheLastofJoel	I'm currently reading texts about Saussure, Martinet... Learning about the linguistic sign (signified/significant)
2013-10-27 20:06:20	TheLastofJoel	morphemes
2013-10-27 20:06:26	TheLastofJoel	and phonology
2013-10-27 20:06:45	TheLastofJoel	I've also done a presentation on Machine Translation
2013-10-27 20:07:18	lorenzo	TheLastofJoel, nice :)
2013-10-27 20:07:36	TheLastofJoel	yup :) So what are you learning in you University?
2013-10-27 20:07:51	lorenzo	uhm up to now we did the semiologic aspects of language
2013-10-27 20:07:53	lorenzo	and phonology
2013-10-27 20:08:03	lorenzo	but our teacher is on holiday for 2 weeks
2013-10-27 20:08:20	lorenzo	so we're doing random stuff
2013-10-27 20:08:54	lorenzo	I bought a book on sociolinguistics and found it to be the most interesting field for me
2013-10-27 20:09:03	TheLastofJoel	oh good,the semiologic like if something is a sign, an icon or a fact? Like the symbol of a light in a switch?
2013-10-27 20:10:00	lorenzo	uhm the difference between symbol (arbitrary and conventional), icon (non arbitrary, non conventional), signal (intentional) and symptom (unintentional)
2013-10-27 20:10:12	lorenzo	we use simbolo / icona / segnale / indice (sintomo)
2013-10-27 20:10:15	lorenzo	so my translations may not be accuarte
2013-10-27 20:10:16	TheLastofJoel	Oh okay, that's good. We're not speaking much about sociolinguistics, except for the difference between diglossia & bilinguism, or things like how much vary the language (level) when used in groups
2013-10-27 20:10:58	lorenzo	also the different properties of language I think, the 4 levels of arbitrariety
2013-10-27 20:11:10	TheLastofJoel	Okay, yeah a little difference from here, but I get the whole. We just put signal & symbols in the same category
2013-10-27 20:11:27	TheLastofJoel	4 levels of arbirarety?
2013-10-27 20:12:11	lorenzo	yeah, the one between signified and signifier
2013-10-27 20:12:20	lorenzo	the one between sign and referent
2013-10-27 20:12:40	lorenzo	the one between form and substance of the signifier
2013-10-27 20:12:46	lorenzo	the one between form and substance of the signified
2013-10-27 20:13:24	TheLastofJoel	Oh okay, it seems deeper than what we study, because we just have the most generic level of arbitrarety, which is between signified and signifer
2013-10-27 20:14:14	lorenzo	then all the other properties, Jakobson language functions
2013-10-27 20:14:23	lorenzo	then we moved onto phonology
2013-10-27 20:14:34	lorenzo	started doing some IPA transcriptions
2013-10-27 20:14:37	lorenzo	then professor went on holiday
2013-10-27 20:14:39	lorenzo	:D
2013-10-27 20:15:21	TheLastofJoel	Lol, same for us, except the Jakobson language functions
2013-10-27 20:15:45	TheLastofJoel	We just segment some swahili sentences into morphemes, and we're doing phonetics transcription based on the french API
2013-10-27 20:16:19	lorenzo	ah yeah, we use Twi language for doing such morphemes thing :D
2013-10-27 20:16:23	lorenzo	never heard of it before
2013-10-27 20:16:27	lorenzo	Merenka Twi :|
2013-10-27 20:16:47	TheLastofJoel	I never heard of it too XD Not even in my course.
2013-10-27 20:17:00	lorenzo	but yeah I guess our programs are similar
2013-10-27 20:17:23	TheLastofJoel	Yes, that's what appear to be. Glad to see that.
2013-10-27 20:17:34	lorenzo	general linguistics don't change much throughout the world I guess / hope
2013-10-27 20:17:54	theriel	oh it definitely does :D
2013-10-27 20:17:59	Leftmost	Theories differ quite a bit.
2013-10-27 20:18:02	TheLastofJoel	Yup, especially when you know that it's not a very old science.
2013-10-27 20:18:11	lorenzo	nono wait, I meant
2013-10-27 20:18:16	lorenzo	they way it's taught, the exercises and such
2013-10-27 20:18:18	theriel	my first syntax class in the US had no other language examples than english
2013-10-27 20:18:31	theriel	here in finland syntax is more typologically based
2013-10-27 20:18:34	lorenzo	there's variation in that too?
2013-10-27 20:18:44	Leftmost	theriel, mine almost didn't, except I kept forcing the issue using Irish.
2013-10-27 20:19:01	Leftmost	"Okay, but Irish does this and that doesn't seem to fit well with that rule."
2013-10-27 20:19:12	theriel	yup :D
2013-10-27 20:19:38	Leftmost	If you teach generative syntax using only English examples, it will all seem very, very tidy.
2013-10-27 20:20:18	theriel	especially with a bunch of ridiulous assumptions like "all languages are underlyingly SVO, and all languages have determiner phrases, etc etc"
2013-10-27 20:20:39	lorenzo	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76740016/imgs/syntax.PNG <
2013-10-27 20:20:41	lorenzo	this is from italian
2013-10-27 20:21:26	TheLastofJoel	There's actually lot of different things, like languages with SVO, other with SOV, etc.
2013-10-27 20:21:50	theriel	of course there is :D
2013-10-27 20:21:50	TheLastofJoel	But we weren't into that so much here. Probably due to the fact that our teacher is a bit slow
2013-10-27 20:22:11	Leftmost	I would really love to see theoretical work on syntax which takes the basic principle generative syntax theories work with (that language is, in some respect, a mechanical process) and dispense with the most egregious assumptions of those theories.
2013-10-27 20:22:11	lorenzo	meh, I gave up with my teacher and try to study from the manual all alone poor me ._.
2013-10-27 20:22:15	lorenzo	as the only thing she does
2013-10-27 20:22:23	lorenzo	are examples of how stuff is said in her dialect from naples
2013-10-27 20:22:37	Leftmost	For all I know, that work has been/is being done, but I don't even know where to start looking.
2013-10-27 20:22:44	lorenzo	once she asked us to tell her all the names for "bitch" we knew
2013-10-27 20:22:45	theriel	lorenzo: do you know mauro tosco?
2013-10-27 20:22:48	lorenzo	this was fun, but lasted 2 hours
2013-10-27 20:22:50	lorenzo	:(
2013-10-27 20:23:04	lorenzo	theriel, no
2013-10-27 20:23:08	theriel	i have the impression he is sort of the linguistics of italy :P
2013-10-27 20:23:17	theriel	most everyone else just does italian stuff
2013-10-27 20:23:24	TheLastofJoel	oh, lol. Might be a pain to have a such teacher. My teacher is more like, after reading each sentence from Saussure, saying "Sorry, I'm not smart enough to explain you what does that mean"
2013-10-27 20:23:31	theriel	he actually has a wide typological background, and he's a good teacher/speaker.. he's worked on a lot of different languages
2013-10-27 20:23:37	TheLastofJoel	mauro tosco, that name, I heard it already
2013-10-27 20:24:08	theriel	if you get a chance to take a course with him or hear him talk, do so :)
2013-10-27 20:24:16	Leftmost	Based on my biases and understanding of how the brain works, I'd suspect that language is dealt with by some mechanical means, albeit rather complex. I think a good theory will be able to model that with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
2013-10-27 20:25:00	theriel	i think language works in a.. semi-mechnical way
2013-10-27 20:25:06	theriel	lots of rules with lots of exceptions :D
2013-10-27 20:25:40	TheLastofJoel	Some people even think that language has been a mere coincidence.
2013-10-27 20:25:58	lorenzo	yeah we could have used fingers to communicate
2013-10-27 20:25:59	lorenzo	or smells :|
2013-10-27 20:25:59	Leftmost	theriel, I tend not to like that sort of description. That's how people describe English, but if I did learn anything from generative syntax, it's that there are a lot fewer exceptions than people expect.
2013-10-27 20:26:04	TheLastofJoel	But actually, it's not really mechanical. Otherwise, Machine translation won't have so much pain to translate...
2013-10-27 20:26:21	Leftmost	It's just that we're unaware of how the rules are structured.
2013-10-27 20:26:34	lorenzo	as you move up in the less physical related fields of language it gets less and less mechanical I guess
2013-10-27 20:26:36	theriel	i dunno, i believe more that language is emergent
2013-10-27 20:26:40	Leftmost	TheLastofJoel, that's not true at all. Machine translation is usually pretty naïve, and language is a complex beast.
2013-10-27 20:27:00	TheLastofJoel	what do you mean by pretty naive?
2013-10-27 20:27:14	theriel	and from what i can tell, there are very very very few universals which seem to hold up in language
2013-10-27 20:27:27	theriel	there's almost always some exception out there
2013-10-27 20:27:29	Leftmost	By far the vast majority of machine translation doesn't use any complex understanding of language. It's either statistical or uses simplistic rules.
2013-10-27 20:27:48	theriel	Leftmost: i assume you're not including finite-state methodology with that?
2013-10-27 20:28:02	theriel	most of the machine translation here uses a more complex understanding of language
2013-10-27 20:28:05	TheLastofJoel	Of course, or an hybrid model (like Systran) which use a statistical based MT along with a Rule Base MT
2013-10-27 20:28:07	Leftmost	Even finite-state machines are somewhat naïve.
2013-10-27 20:28:19	TheLastofJoel	Google Translate use Statistical MT
2013-10-27 20:28:25	theriel	yeah and it's horrible :D
2013-10-27 20:28:42	Leftmost	It's more complex than SMT and uses more understanding of language, but its rules are still very surface-level.
2013-10-27 20:28:53	TheLastofJoel	Well, based on several tests (BLUE, etc.), it's still the best online (free) translator
2013-10-27 20:29:04	theriel	TheLastofJoel: depends for what languages
2013-10-27 20:29:18	theriel	translate.ru is the best one i've seen for french/german/english/russian anyway
2013-10-27 20:29:31	theriel	it makes mistakes and gets word orders wrong and such but way better than google
2013-10-27 20:30:00	TheLastofJoel	Sure thing, because it's based on parallel corpus, you'll find much more accuracy with english/ french/ german/ etc.
2013-10-27 20:30:08	Leftmost	And as to the lack of universals, I'm sure that's true at a fairly high level, but that doesn't need to indicate that the processes can't be modeled accurately and even universally at some deeper level.
2013-10-27 20:30:09	TheLastofJoel	rather than with not so popular languages.
2013-10-27 20:30:49	TheLastofJoel	I actually wasn't aware of this translate.ru
2013-10-27 20:31:07	lorenzo	TheLastofJoel, still I'm not sure about how to structure my courses, I can pick between a) studying languages b) studying linguistics c) studying foreign literatures d) studying business in foreign languages
2013-10-27 20:31:31	lorenzo	for this first year I have like 8 literature exams, a history exam and a linguistics exam. :P
2013-10-27 20:32:21	theriel	depends on what you want to do in the future?
2013-10-27 20:32:24	lorenzo	I have no idea
2013-10-27 20:32:30	TheLastofJoel	wow, that's a lot! We don't have literature exams here, we just have sociology, psychology, computers, etc.
2013-10-27 20:32:33	lorenzo	not that I care much as long as I study interesting stuff
2013-10-27 20:32:47	theriel	i like history and linguistics at least
2013-10-27 20:32:57	theriel	there are lots of ways in which those can combine too
2013-10-27 20:33:38	lorenzo	I can also mix all the exams, there are no rules
2013-10-27 20:33:39	TheLastofJoel	Well, personally I like linguistics, so that's what I'll take (b), but I don't know, it highly depend upon what do you want to do with it.
2013-10-27 20:33:46	Leftmost	theriel, considering the nature of the physical structure of the brain and its processes (chemical reactions ultimately passing electrical signals between neurons), I think it's necessarily true that there is some way to model the brain's activity, as it is essentially mechanical.
2013-10-27 20:33:49	lorenzo	so I'll see :D
2013-10-27 20:34:10	Leftmost	If it's possible to model the brain, then it is necessarily true that it is possible to model the brain's capabilities, such as language.
2013-10-27 20:34:13	lorenzo	I also picked 2 foreign languages to study which is the minimum and only constraint (english and spanish)
2013-10-27 20:34:15	TheLastofJoel	Yup, try to check each program (in deep) or to ask courses in uni.
2013-10-27 20:34:16	theriel	Leftmost: yeah i wish cognitive scientists would get away from english and do more typology stuff, it might be more rewarding
2013-10-27 20:34:31	Leftmost	I've been strongly tempted to get into neurolinguistics.
2013-10-27 20:34:38	Leftmost	Very strongly tempted.
2013-10-27 20:34:49	Leftmost	I just don't know how I would go about doing that.
2013-10-27 20:35:51	theriel	go check out navajo then, i want to see how that language works in the brain
2013-10-27 20:36:17	Leftmost	I would too!
2013-10-27 20:36:24	theriel	athabaskan languages are so phenomenally complex that i think they pose a real challenge to a lot of the flimsier chomskyan stuff
2013-10-27 20:37:08	theriel	btw, you might find this interesting: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9706227/Levinson%20-%20Myth%20of%20Language%20Universals.pdf
2013-10-27 20:37:27	Leftmost	Oh, I have no love for Chomskyan linguistics. I think those theories are way too obsessed with English to ever mutate into something worthwhile.
2013-10-27 20:38:11	theriel	i think the abstract alone is kinda up your alley :D
2013-10-27 20:39:01	Leftmost	I just think that the introduction of the idea of mechanically modelling language was an important one. I also like how computable G&B is, though it obviously starts to fall apart the further you get from English.
2013-10-27 20:39:24	theriel	yeah and since i work on languages which don't fit well with that...
2013-10-27 20:39:29	Leftmost	(The knots I've seen people tie themselves into to explain phenomena in Irish are... frustrating.)
2013-10-27 20:40:49	Leftmost	"Oh, well, obviously it's underlyingly SVO and the V just moves up in the structure!"
2013-10-27 20:41:00	theriel	yeah
2013-10-27 20:41:04	theriel	did you check that link btw?
2013-10-27 20:41:44	Leftmost	Reading the abstract. Will have to read the rest later, as I'm a little bit tipsy at the moment.
2013-10-27 20:42:07	theriel	aha
2013-10-27 20:42:12	theriel	i'm on the other end of that.. a trifle hung over
2013-10-27 20:42:24	theriel	friend got married last night, and finns apparently really know how to throw a wedding party :D
2013-10-27 20:42:45	Leftmost	Don't entirely recall? :)
2013-10-27 20:43:01	theriel	haha, i'm missing 3 or 4 hours i'm afraid
2013-10-27 20:43:21	theriel	i apparently came home at 3 or 4 but i don't remember anything after about 23:30
2013-10-27 20:43:36	Leftmost	I opened a beer earlier without knowing much about it. Turned out to be a barleywine-like Belgian dark at 11.6%.
2013-10-27 20:43:42	lorenzo	I like reading strange research papers
2013-10-27 20:43:52	lorenzo	like "Behavioral and Linguistic Developments in the Interactions of Normal and Retarded Children
2013-10-27 20:43:52	lorenzo	with Their Mothers"
2013-10-27 20:43:53	theriel	lorenzo: levinson is a good one to read :)
2013-10-27 20:44:09	theriel	http://www.mpi.nl/people/levinson-stephen/publications almost all his stuff is downloadable
2013-10-27 20:44:22	lorenzo	my university only costs 70 EUR / year , I wonder how can they afford jstor
2013-10-27 20:44:45	TheLastofJoel	Yup, me too, it's actually very interesting. Or Thesis/ PH.D in linguistics
2013-10-27 20:44:46	Leftmost	Bloody hell.
2013-10-27 20:44:46	theriel	they probably only get some publications from there.. and their money is coming from the government, not tuition
2013-10-27 20:44:51	Leftmost	I want to go to your university
2013-10-27 20:44:51	Leftmost	.
2013-10-27 20:45:03	theriel	it's the same here lorenzo
2013-10-27 20:45:21	Leftmost	Really, I want to find a good neurolinguisics program, but I don't even know where to start looking. :-P
2013-10-27 20:45:29	theriel	something like 80e per year, and then that gets you half price on all public transport, university cafeteria food for €2,50, etc
2013-10-27 20:45:47	TheLastofJoel	Tuitions in France are something like 150€
2013-10-27 20:46:06	theriel	Leftmost: did you ever read the book the brain that changes itself?
2013-10-27 20:46:14	Leftmost	I did not.
2013-10-27 20:46:21	TheLastofJoel	per year, at least in Free University. Otherwise, it's something like 6000€
2013-10-27 20:46:23	theriel	awesome book, highly recommend
2013-10-27 20:46:28	Leftmost	I paid... $4000 a year, as an in-state student (thereby getting reduced tuition).
2013-10-27 20:47:15	theriel	lorenzo: what university do you study at?
2013-10-27 20:47:20	TheLastofJoel	I hope that it was good, then.
2013-10-27 20:47:29	lorenzo	theriel, it's a very very small one http://www.lett.unipmn.it/
2013-10-27 20:47:46	lorenzo	the interiors are good thou https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76740016/imgs/IMG_0055.JPG :D
2013-10-27 20:47:54	lorenzo	I'd spend all the day there
2013-10-27 20:48:04	Leftmost	Sometimes good, sometimes bad.
2013-10-27 20:48:13	Leftmost	I did have a couple of truly excellent professors, but not many.
2013-10-27 20:48:46	theriel	hrm is that in turin?
2013-10-27 20:48:51	lorenzo	nope, Vercelli
2013-10-27 20:49:00	Leftmost	I took historical linguistics from the former head of our department, his last class after retirement and before ceasing teaching altogether. One of the best classes I've taken.
2013-10-27 20:49:11	lorenzo	around 1 hour from turin

2013-10-27 20:49:48	lorenzo	great thing about such a small university is that in some courses we're like 10-12 guys
2013-10-27 20:49:56	lorenzo	so even the teachers call us by name
2013-10-27 20:50:17	theriel	yeah i never even heard of vercelli, had to see where that was in a map :D
2013-10-27 20:50:32	lorenzo	bad thing is that there are no services, as it's small and no one cares about it :P
2013-10-27 20:50:46	Leftmost	Our text was largely concerned with IE languages, but the professor was (in addition to being a native speaker of Sicilian and Italian, and fluent in English with virtually no accent—it took me the better part of a semester to figure out English wasn't his native language) he was fluent in Okanagan, an Interior Salishan language, and most of our lectures and homework were applying historical methods to the seven Interior Salishan langu
2013-10-27 20:50:46	Leftmost	ages.
2013-10-27 20:50:49	lorenzo	like there's free internet, but it only works in a room due do the thick ancient walls :P
2013-10-27 20:52:13	Leftmost	Homework today? You know the reflexes of /k/. Here's a word that starts with it. Go find cognates in the other six languages.
2013-10-27 20:52:37	theriel	roger blench has some pretty interesting publications on historical linguistics
2013-10-27 20:54:39	TheLastofJoel	historical linguistics, or origin of the language? On the origin of languages, Merritt Ruhlen is pretty interesting

2013-10-28 19:12:39	YaRly	Some linguists claim that adjectives don't exist in certain languages – they're really nouns that are used as adjectives. What's the deal with this kind of thinking?
2013-10-28 19:30:21	cntrational	YaRly: I have to go update ubuntu right now, but basically verbs and adjectives can fill in for adjectives
2013-10-28 19:30:54	cntrational	YaRly: basically imagine saying "redness of apple" or "the apple that reds"
2013-10-28 19:31:04	cntrational	YaRly: japanese does the latter
2013-10-28 19:31:44	cntrational	anyhoo, ciao
2013-10-28 19:31:52	<--	cntrational (~cntration@49.205.77.125) has quit (Quit: o/)
2013-10-28 19:33:27	YaRly	The apple has redness, hmm...
2013-10-28 19:33:52	YaRly	The room has largeness
2013-10-28 19:34:36	YaRly	So one can say that abstract nouns are like adjectives in some or in these cases?
2013-10-28 19:38:29	YaRly	bah, this is such a mind twist
2013-10-28 19:41:43	YaRly	With this kind of reasoning, one could break apart verbs and nouns too and say: "There is no real distinction between them. It's all in our heads. Quantum physics ftw!"
2013-10-28 19:45:57	YaRly	Even if one uses a verb or abstract noun, isn't the adjective implied? I.e. isn't it embedded in the verb or noun somehow?
2013-10-28 19:46:46	YaRly	For example, in "to rejoice" isn't joyfulness or the quality of joy implied?
2013-10-28 19:47:05	theriel	you're mixing up semantics and grammar
2013-10-28 19:47:21	theriel	meaning does not necessarily imply part of speech
2013-10-28 19:47:45	theriel	i work on a language which doesn't really have adjectives, incidentally
2013-10-28 19:47:58	YaRly	oh, which language is that ?
2013-10-28 19:48:13	theriel	there's a subcategory of verbs which I'm calling stative verbs, which can function to modify nouns if you use derivational morphology
2013-10-28 19:48:19	theriel	Uduk
2013-10-28 19:48:55	theriel	you can use nouns to modify other nouns, or verbs to modify nouns, but neither are really "adjectives" in the same way that english has
2013-10-28 19:49:21	YaRly	they can't take a superlative or comparative form either?
2013-10-28 19:49:30	theriel	just like english doesn't really have stative verbs.. 'to be big, to be blue, etc".. we use a copula
2013-10-28 19:49:42	theriel	nope
2013-10-28 19:50:22	theriel	you can either say "very big" for bigger, or else you can say something like "surpass ____ in 'bigness" (best translation i can give)
2013-10-28 19:51:03	YaRly	ah
2013-10-28 19:51:23	YaRly	hmm...well, I'm working on Kurdish atm...and many words are distinguished as adjective in Kurdish (that can take comp. and supl. form). However, many adjectives are also used as nouns
2013-10-28 19:52:03	YaRly	for example, you can "my big" (which would translate to "my big one" or "my superior")
2013-10-28 19:52:32	YaRly	based on phenomena like this one, some linguists say that these aren't really adjectives, but rather nouns
2013-10-28 19:52:34	theriel	yep, some languages have adjectives which are more noun-like, some have more verb-like, and some have neither
2013-10-28 19:53:01	theriel	well, what's an adjective?
2013-10-28 19:53:04	YaRly	yea but...hrm...I can't help but to think that they are actually adjectives *used like nouns* and not vice versa
2013-10-28 19:53:18	theriel	good luck coming up with a satisfactory answer to that :D
2013-10-28 19:53:27	YaRly	yea, a zero morpheme? :P
2013-10-28 19:53:34	YaRly	derivational
2013-10-28 19:53:40	theriel	i mean in general
2013-10-28 19:57:12	YaRly	hmm...what do they have to defend that these are really nouns though?
2013-10-28 19:57:21	YaRly	except for the above example
2013-10-28 19:57:43	theriel	i have no idea about kurdish in particular, and you're being rather vague otherwise :D but there are definitely languages without adjectives
2013-10-28 19:58:37	theriel	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9706227/Levinson%20-%20Myth%20of%20Language%20Universals.pdf you might find this article interesting
2013-10-28 19:59:06	YaRly	yea, I don't really know what information to provide. :P
2013-10-28 19:59:27	YaRly	will take a look
2013-10-28 20:01:08	theriel	well basically it talks about a lot of the preconceived notions about language (particularly in the American context), and shows how most of them are due to faulty reasoning/misunderstandings, or lack of a diverse context
2013-10-28 20:01:17	theriel	and then talks about the implications
2013-10-28 20:01:33	theriel	it does discuss the adjective issue, but also the fact that some languages don't even distinguish between nouns and verbs
2013-10-28 20:02:51	YaRly	Interesting. Do many of these preconceived notions come from Chomsky's theories about universal grammar etc.?
2013-10-28 20:03:10	theriel	sort of.. often it's from misunderstandings about his theories :D
2013-10-28 20:03:28	theriel	sometimes it's directly from that though
2013-10-28 20:04:23	theriel	As a result, Chomsky’s notion of Univer-
2013-10-28 20:04:24	theriel	sal Grammar (UG) has been mistaken, not for what it is –
2013-10-28 20:04:24	theriel	namely, the programmatic label for whatever it turns out
2013-10-28 20:04:24	theriel	to be that all children bring to learning a language – but
2013-10-28 20:04:24	theriel	for a set of substantial research findings about what all
2013-10-28 20:04:32	theriel	languages have in common.
2013-10-28 20:05:02	theriel	so basically people don't look for whatever might be there cognitively, but instead look for what languages have in common.. and to be honest, it's "not much", if you take all languages into account
2013-10-28 20:05:38	theriel	and then they're biased by mainly just looking at english and other more familiar european languages, and then assume that these languages are representative of language in general
2013-10-28 20:05:49	YaRly	ok...
2013-10-28 20:07:22	YaRly	I read an article about "principle and parameters" a while ago, isn't this basically an attempt to apply Chomsky's theories to the real world? (If so, then this paper scrutinizes PP as well I presume)
2013-10-28 20:08:38	theriel	take a look at the paper first :)  you don't have to read all of it, but i think even the first 3 pages will be pretty good at summarizing a lot of the issues
2013-10-28 20:11:54	YaRly	ya, reading
2013-10-28 20:23:48	YaRly	theriel: How do speakers plan
2013-10-28 20:23:48	YaRly	the encoding of visual stimuli if the semantic resources
2013-10-28 20:23:48	YaRly	of the language make quite different distinctions?
2013-10-28 20:24:04	YaRly	haha
2013-10-28 20:24:09	theriel	huh?
2013-10-28 20:24:37	YaRly	a question from the paper
2013-10-28 20:42:03	YaRly	theriel: only read to page 4 now, but will read on later. Thanks for the link
2013-10-28 20:45:03	YaRly	it's not unimaginable that there is only 1 fundamental word class, and that we've arbitrarily made subcategories because of the practical value of it
2013-10-28 20:45:13	YaRly	but...cross trainer time! laterz

(ie, traders adopting a convention to keep a tally in writing, for example)
2013-11-03 04:29:27	sytse	hmm. Is there a language that developed abstract numbers (of arbitrary size) without ever having a system of writing them down?

2013-11-25 00:29:53	Eszett	So I've noticed that in English, "haven't" isn't really a contraction of "have not" now, but more of a negative form of have, since you'd say "haven't you" but "have you not", right? Is it a past tense exclusive thing ("I haven't done ..."), or is it ever used for possesion? Reason I ask is because I just wrote "they haven't such a thing" in my notes and it doesn't feel right. Native English speaker here.
2013-11-25 00:37:22	zort	who cares? that said, http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/haven%27t
2013-11-25 00:39:28	zort	also have a gander at a corpus: http://www.lextutor.ca/concordancers/concord_e.html
2013-11-25 00:47:19	Eszett	zort: ooh, that wiktionary page confirmed another suspicion of mine
2013-11-25 00:47:43	Eszett	I noticed that "I've got" was actually more like "I have" than "I've gotten" in the way I used it

2013-12-13 17:33:08	Leftmost	zeto28, it depends on how people want to define that word, though they do show many of the features of spoken language and there are linguists who focus on studying sign.
2013-12-13 17:46:29	zeto28	Leftmost: what's a useful definition of the word "language"? I always assumed that to be useful, language should be defined as one-dimensional or having only one channel (the voice) as opposed to several (hands+face for sign language).  are there some academic conventions/classification systems?
2013-12-13 17:48:19	Leftmost	There's no widespread formal definition that I'm aware of. But even within spoken language, it's acknowledged that the voice is far from the only meaningful signifier.
2013-12-13 17:53:05	zeto28	it's a little disappointing to learn that linguistics doesn't have a set of sharp definitions of what is and isn't considered a language.  and aren't signifiers other than the voice merely "gesticular annotations", i.e. not part of the actual language?
2013-12-13 17:56:58	Leftmost	Well, not everyone agrees on what constitutes a language, to start with, and rigorous definitions often don't exist in the field. And they're not part of the syntax or morphology or similar, but I think they'd fall under pragmatics to an extent.

2013-12-19 10:48:30	rufsketch1	does anyone know where I can find a corpus of english compound words split into their component words?
2013-12-19 10:49:19	rufsketch1	Or, less useful, but still good, a corpus of english compound words
2013-12-19 10:49:37	rufsketch1	not including acronyms
2013-12-19 10:50:20	rufsketch1	I've found a few of the latter, but they're pretty small and insufficient, omitting things as common as "girlfriend"

2013-12-27 04:56:49	Radon_3	Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2013-12-27 04:59:17	Radon_3	anyone?
2013-12-27 05:04:19	zort	Just ask and someone may answer.
2013-12-27 05:07:16	Radon_3	Great
2013-12-27 05:08:13	Radon_3	Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2013-12-27 05:08:18	Radon_3	I mean
2013-12-27 05:09:36	Radon_3	What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2013-12-27 05:11:06	lucky	that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2013-12-27 05:11:25	lucky	It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2013-12-27 05:11:47	Radon_3	lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2013-12-27 05:11:57	lucky	Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2013-12-27 05:12:52	lucky	an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2013-12-27 05:14:09	lucky	Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2013-12-27 05:14:34	lucky	Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2013-12-27 05:14:57	lucky	But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2013-12-27 05:15:23	lucky	I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2013-12-27 05:17:50	Radon_3	lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2013-12-27 05:32:27	lucky	yep
2013-12-27 05:32:50	Radon_3	OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2013-12-27 05:32:50	Radon_3	in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2013-12-27 05:32:50	Radon_3	nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2013-12-27 05:34:36	Radon_3	let me edit this paragraph a bit please.

I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).

2013-12-27 05:59:11	zort	no
2013-12-27 06:00:17	zort	do these differences have any observable consequences?
2013-12-27 06:01:23	Radon_3	zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2013-12-27 06:02:01	zort	what are you talking about then? the soul?
2013-12-27 06:02:36	Radon_3	people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2013-12-27 06:04:07	Radon_3	I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2013-12-27 06:05:25	Radon_3	A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2013-12-27 06:09:31	lucky	Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2013-12-27 06:09:46	lucky	It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2013-12-27 06:11:54	Radon_3	lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.

2014-01-07 02:41:18	x0011BF	Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-07 02:41:33	x0011BF	I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-07 02:42:07	x0011BF	Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-07 02:42:22	x0011BF	I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-07 02:43:23	x0011BF	I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.

2014-01-07 03:31:15	theriel_	http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-07 03:32:30	--	theriel_ is now known as theriel
2014-01-07 03:33:39	x0011BF	Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-07 03:33:39	x0011BF	I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-07 03:33:49	x0011BF	But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-07 03:35:31	theriel	there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-07 03:35:43	theriel	so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-07 03:35:52	x0011BF	Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-07 03:35:58	x0011BF	So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-07 03:36:24	x0011BF	I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-07 03:36:41	theriel	well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-07 03:36:46	theriel	so that makes things easier
2014-01-07 03:36:56	x0011BF	Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-07 03:37:04	x0011BF	He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-07 03:37:12	x0011BF	So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-07 03:38:20	theriel	some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-07 03:38:28	theriel	sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-07 03:38:48	theriel	so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-07 03:39:57	x0011BF	Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-07 03:40:22	x0011BF	It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-07 03:40:40	x0011BF	Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-07 03:41:03	x0011BF	But I see almost no one calling any language that online.

2014-01-07 04:00:15	theriel	language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-07 04:01:21	theriel	for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-07 04:01:39	theriel	the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-07 04:01:50	theriel	the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-07 04:02:03	theriel	and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-07 04:02:19	theriel	it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-07 04:02:26	x0011BF	Yah
2014-01-07 04:02:29	theriel	and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D

2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-17 10:23:17	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-17 10:23:17	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?

2014-01-17 10:23:17	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-17 10:23:17	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-17 10:23:17	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-17 10:23:17	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-17 10:23:17	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-17 10:23:17	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-17 10:23:17	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-17 10:23:17	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all

2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "

2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-22 21:50:28	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-22 21:50:28	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?

2014-01-22 21:50:28	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-22 21:50:28	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-22 21:50:28	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-22 21:50:28	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-22 21:50:28	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-22 21:50:28	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-22 21:50:28	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all
2014-01-22 21:50:28	jankes	[17:35:27] hello
2014-01-22 21:50:28	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-26 10:12:44	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[07:36:11] maybe search "neurolinguistics"?

2014-01-26 10:12:44	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-26 10:12:44	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-26 10:12:44	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-26 10:12:44	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-26 10:12:44	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-26 10:12:44	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-26 10:12:44	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?

2014-01-26 10:12:44	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-01-26 10:12:44	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	zort	[01:48:36] nevermind I think I understand.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cassowaries	[01:52:25] TONE AND ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-27 20:13:56	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-27 20:13:56	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?

2014-01-27 20:13:56	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-27 20:13:56	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-27 20:13:56	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-27 20:13:56	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-27 20:13:56	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-27 20:13:56	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?

2014-01-27 20:13:56	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-01-27 20:13:56	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-27 20:13:56	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess
2014-01-27 20:13:56	EvilRoey	[02:13:05] we͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜e!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Oranjer	[09:24:03] is there such a thing as a list of pragmatic primes, out of a combination of which all speech acts come about?

2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[20:16:28] hi there
2014-01-27 20:13:56	jankes	[20:16:44] theriel: nice to meet you. where are you from?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	theriel	[20:17:24] born in US, normally live in finland, currently in ethiopia.. not sure what answer you want :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	jankes	[20:18:56] fine
2014-01-27 20:13:56	jankes	[20:19:01] i come from poland

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-28 09:22:42	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[07:36:11] maybe search "neurolinguistics"?

2014-01-28 09:22:42	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-28 09:22:42	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-28 09:22:42	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-28 09:22:42	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-28 09:22:42	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-28 09:22:42	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all
2014-01-28 09:22:42	jankes	[17:35:27] hello
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-01-28 09:22:42	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	zort	[01:48:36] nevermind I think I understand.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cassowaries	[01:52:25] TONE AND ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess
2014-01-28 09:22:42	EvilRoey	[02:13:05] we͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜e!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Oranjer	[09:24:03] is there such a thing as a list of pragmatic primes, out of a combination of which all speech acts come about?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	drbean	[10:16:28] If you find it, please link it here.

2014-01-28 09:22:42	jankes	[20:16:44] theriel: nice to meet you. where are you from?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	theriel	[20:17:24] born in US, normally live in finland, currently in ethiopia.. not sure what answer you want :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	jankes	[20:18:56] fine
2014-01-28 09:22:42	jankes	[20:19:01] i come from poland

2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-28 12:39:01	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[07:36:11] maybe search "neurolinguistics"?

2014-01-28 12:39:01	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-28 12:39:01	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-28 12:39:01	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-28 12:39:01	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-28 12:39:01	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-28 12:39:01	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-28 12:39:01	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-28 12:39:01	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-28 12:39:01	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-28 12:39:01	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all
2014-01-28 12:39:01	jankes	[17:35:27] hello
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-01-28 12:39:01	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	zort	[01:48:36] nevermind I think I understand.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Cassowaries	[01:52:25] TONE AND ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess

2014-01-28 12:39:01	Oranjer	[09:24:03] is there such a thing as a list of pragmatic primes, out of a combination of which all speech acts come about?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	drbean	[10:16:28] If you find it, please link it here.

2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[20:16:28] hi there
2014-01-28 12:39:01	jankes	[20:16:44] theriel: nice to meet you. where are you from?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	theriel	[20:17:24] born in US, normally live in finland, currently in ethiopia.. not sure what answer you want :D
2014-01-28 12:39:01	jankes	[20:18:56] fine
2014-01-28 12:39:01	jankes	[20:19:01] i come from poland

2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-28 20:56:54	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[07:36:11] maybe search "neurolinguistics"?

2014-01-28 20:56:54	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-28 20:56:54	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-28 20:56:54	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-28 20:56:54	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-28 20:56:54	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-28 20:56:54	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[17:35:27] hello
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[03:14:43] hello
2014-01-28 20:56:54	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	zort	[01:48:36] nevermind I think I understand.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cassowaries	[01:52:25] TONE AND ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess
2014-01-28 20:56:54	EvilRoey	[02:13:05] we͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜e!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Oranjer	[09:24:03] is there such a thing as a list of pragmatic primes, out of a combination of which all speech acts come about?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	drbean	[10:16:28] If you find it, please link it here.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[20:11:09] hello
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[20:16:28] hi there
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[20:16:44] theriel: nice to meet you. where are you from?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	theriel	[20:17:24] born in US, normally live in finland, currently in ethiopia.. not sure what answer you want :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[20:18:56] fine
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[20:19:01] i come from poland
2014-01-28 20:56:54	jankes	[20:19:10] i wish i were accurancy in english, indeed

2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-01-31 16:50:27	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:40:40] hello?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Radon_3	[06:40:44] ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[07:36:11] maybe search "neurolinguistics"?

2014-01-31 16:50:27	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-01-31 16:50:27	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-01-31 16:50:27	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-01-31 16:50:27	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-01-31 16:50:27	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-01-31 16:50:27	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-01-31 16:50:27	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-01-31 16:50:27	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-01-31 16:50:27	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-01-31 16:50:27	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	EvilRoey	[22:07:13] hi all
2014-01-31 16:50:27	jankes	[17:35:27] hello
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	jankes	[03:14:43] hello
2014-01-31 16:50:27	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Jankess	[17:47:50] hello everybody
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[01:44:06] in IPA, what do ó and e͜e represent? (from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	zort	[01:48:36] nevermind I think I understand.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cassowaries	[01:52:25] TONE AND ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Cassowaries	[01:53:04] although why 15thC Constantinopolitan also has pitch accent is anyone's guess
2014-01-31 16:50:27	EvilRoey	[02:13:05] we͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜ee͜e!
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Oranjer	[09:24:03] is there such a thing as a list of pragmatic primes, out of a combination of which all speech acts come about?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	drbean	[10:16:28] If you find it, please link it here.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	jankes	[20:11:09] hello

2014-02-05 08:56:28	zort	is there any online dictionary that's as ambitious as Wiktionary but more complete?
2014-02-05 09:12:03	Leftmost	It's pretty unlikely.
2014-02-05 09:24:47	zort	ok, is there any online dictionary that's as ambitious as Wiktionary?
2014-02-05 09:25:23	Leftmost	OmegaWiki, to an extent. What are you after?
2014-02-05 09:46:18	zort	Leftmost: oh, just curious, at this point.
2014-02-05 09:57:27	zort	wow OmegaWiki looks like a good idea.
2014-02-05 09:58:03	Leftmost	If you ask me, its structure is useful for certain applications of NLP, but isn't good as a general dictionary.
2014-02-05 09:59:02	zort	what is it missing?
2014-02-05 09:59:43	Leftmost	It ignores the complexities of translating words. Its structure assumes that a translation will be a 100% match for the word it's applied to when that is frequently not the case.
2014-02-05 10:01:50	Leftmost	There's no way to say "this word is a translation for this word in language X, but not a translation for this other word in language Y which is also a translation for the word in language X" or "this word is frequently used to translate this word in language X, but it's not an exact match".
2014-02-05 10:04:24	zort	I guess I just want a uniform frontend to a lot of unilingual dictionaries.
2014-02-05 10:05:09	Leftmost	There's stardict, but it's got structural problems of its own. I think it's also unmaintained and just not very nice.
2014-02-05 10:07:30	zort	for future reference, how did you find this stuff? I google "online multilingual dictionary" and I get a lot of crap.
2014-02-05 10:08:19	Covered	I think that wiktionary is the best that we have nowadays
2014-02-05 10:08:54	Leftmost	Dictionaries are a big interest of mine. I used to contribute to OmegaWiki, which I found through talking to Wiktionary folks, and dealt with stardict as part of my work for them.
2014-02-05 10:12:08	Covered	I had terminology classes so it's annoying...
2014-02-05 10:12:12	Covered	but I like dictionaries
2014-02-05 10:12:26	zort	terminology class?

2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[04:56:49] Hi, is anyone here seeing this message? I really need some little help. I am for two days really interested in this topic that just hit me when I was looking up the word 'possess' in M-W dictionary, but I don't know where to look for an answer. Can I ask my question here?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[04:59:17] anyone?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[05:04:19] Just ask and someone may answer.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:07:16] Great
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:08:13] Is there a difference between the way a native English speaker knows and feels about a word in English, and the way an EFL learner does? IF so, what are those differences?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:08:18] I mean
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:09:36] What is the difference between a native speaker knowing all the definitions of the word "knowledge" and an EFL learner knowing the same all the definions of the same word.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:11:06] that's an open-ended question and i don't think there's any certain answers
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:11:25] It's still uncertain if second languages are acquired in a fundamentally different way from first languages
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:11:47] lucky, would you please tell me a little bit more? Cause I am really interested in knowing about this.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:11:57] Sheer breadth of knowledge is usually a factor unless a person has been fully immersed in a language for years if not decades, though.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:12:52] an educated native speaker has decades of immersion in all the major contexts and registers of the language
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:14:09] Radon_3, well, one of the big things that comes very late in language acquisition is the ability to determine if something is ungrammatical or nonsensical
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:14:34] Aside from words I may not know, I can judge almost any utterance's grammaticality for my dialect
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:14:57] But even after years of learning a language, a second-language speaker may not have that confidence
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:15:23] I don't in French, despite ten years of studying it formally and having lived with francophone family.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:17:50] lucky, I am absolutely thankful for all the information you have given me so far. So, correct me if I am wrong: what you are suggesting is that the more a person gets involved with a language the more confidence and vocabulary knowledge they may have. right?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[05:32:27] yep
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:32:50] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones). I myself know almost all the senses of the word science (those
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:32:50] in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but still I have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an English Speaking American's mind a
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:32:50] nd the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian). I also believe the same might be true about when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:34:36] let me edit this paragraph a bit please.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:37:01] OK, your silence kind of makes me feel that you agree with what I said. But again my real doubt about this idea that there might exist some fundamental differences between how a word is viewed, used, or even felt by a native English speaker or an EFL Learner (even those advanced ones) still remains. I myself know almost all the senses of the word "
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:37:01] science" (those in Merriam-Webster dictionary), I can use the word with high confidence in many different contexts and also I don't feel even a bit strange about it when I hear it, and I understand it completely, but I still have this sort of feeling that there is a difference between the information and the network present in an average English sp
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:37:01] eaking American's mind about the word "science" and the ones present in my mind (my first language is persian) about the same word, beside the fact that both have the same dictionary info in our brains. I also believe the same might be true, when an American might try learning my language (persian).
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[05:48:46] I am sorry lucky. My Internet is experiencing some problems, I am from Iran after all. Did you say anything while I was gone?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[05:59:11] no
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[06:00:17] do these differences have any observable consequences?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[06:01:23] zort: In my personal opinion: no. they don't.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[06:02:01] what are you talking about then? the soul?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[06:02:36] people might as well recognize the learner as professional as a native speaker. No, I am not talking about the soul.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[06:04:07] I am talking about a network which might apperantly be missing from any one's view.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[06:05:25] A native speaker, doesn't have a background or a base for building up his mother language. But a second language learner will, even if he is very professional, refer back to his mother tongue (maybe in a very unconscious level)  while using English
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[06:09:31] Radon_3, hm, it's an area i'm not too familiar with
2014-02-05 19:45:53	lucky	[06:09:46] It's something that has been explored recently with brain imaging but I don't know much about it
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Radon_3	[06:11:54] lucky: Can you please, please tell me where I could read more about this? That's what I am really thirsty for, right now.

2014-02-05 19:45:53	beautyintheskies	[01:49:25] Hi im planning to major in linguistics. any other linguistics majors out there?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	beautyintheskies	[02:05:09] i guess nobody is here
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:41:11] Oi oi
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:41:18] Anyone here familiar with Berber languages?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:41:33] I know someone from a Berber-speaking tradition, and he calls his language "Jabeli"
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:42:07] Which from what I gather is like calling a  language "Appalacian"
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:42:22] I guess it comes from the arabic word Jabal for mountain, because people who live in the mountains speak Berber.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[02:43:23] I kinda want to know what specific language he speaks, but I'm not seeing much reference to Jabeli on Google.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel_	[03:30:19] where is it spoken?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel_	[03:31:15] http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/berb1260 probably could help you figure out which one it is
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:33:39] Yes, I tried that approach.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:33:39] I am guessing it's Nafusi based on where his family lives.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:33:49] But I never found a solid connection between Jabeli and Berber, so I still wonder how he's using the term.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:35:31] there probably are good words to distinguish different berber varieties
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:35:43] so asking how he says some things would be a way to differentiate the lect
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:35:52] Well he's back in Libya now.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:35:58] So I probably won't see him for a few years.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:36:24] I'm going to try and brush up on Berber before then and ask him how he says things.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:36:41] well there are only 4 berber varieties spoken in libya
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:36:46] so that makes things easier
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:36:56] Yes, I think it's Nafusi.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:37:04] He also has an American wife so his children should be fluent bilingual speakers within 5-6 years.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:37:12] So I can probably ask them for finer distinctions.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:38:20] some of the libyan varieties aren't very well described
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:38:28] sawknah for instance has almost nothing
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[03:38:48] so you may not have a lot of luck in figuring it out without doing quite a bit of digging
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:39:57] Well I know the town he's from and it's listed as being a Nafusi-speaking town.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:40:22] It's a relatively large city so I think there is likely information about it.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:40:40] Now I'm mainly curious about the fact that he almost _exclusively_ calls it Jabeli.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[03:41:03] But I see almost no one calling any language that online.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:00:15] language names are often hard to figure out sometimes
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:01:21] for instance, in my own area, there are 5 different koman languages spoken in ethiopia/sudan.. komo, opo, gwama, uduk, and gule
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:01:39] the gwama speakers sometimes call themselves gwama, sometimes they call themselves komo
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:01:50] the komo speakers sometimes also call themselves komo, sometimes other things
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:02:03] and some gwama call themselves mao, which is also another unrelated language
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:02:19] it's a royal mess to tease apart who speaks what
2014-02-05 19:45:53	x0011BF	[04:02:26] Yah
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[04:02:29] and opo is only like 800 speakers in total and has like 20 different names :D
2014-02-05 19:45:53	YaRly	[21:01:50] Is there a channel for subtitling out there?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[11:16:51] huh. 'peaked' as /ˈpiːkɪd/.. did not know it was usually pronounced that way when talking about being exhausted/sickly (used that way in the US; an 'eye dialect' spelling is of course often used, 'pekid')
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[11:17:49] heard it on the mentalist
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Parth	[11:18:05] I've never heard anyone say it that way :|
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[12:00:13] well, patrick jayne did :)
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[12:02:34] so now you know, if you come across the adjective 'peaked' in that meaning, you should pronounce it like an idiot ;-)
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[12:03:39] apparently that pronunciation being tied specifically to that meaning is not new btw, 1913 webster says: (Oftener p[=e]k"[e^]d) Sickly; not robust. [Colloq.]
2014-02-05 19:45:53	yeryry	[12:32:49] Forms:  18 peaked; Eng. regional (south.) 18 peakid, 18 picked; U.S. regional 18 peecked, 18 picked, 19 peekid, 19 pickid.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Parth	[12:47:21] ¯\(º_o)/¯
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[21:52:57] sytse: i'd say it as /pikt/.. like picked but with /i/, not /I/
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[21:53:36] and i never know what to do with vowel length in english.. /i/ is short before voiceless consonants, long before voiced consonants
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Cassowaries	[22:17:32] some people do use /ɪd/ pronunciations with adjectives more often
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Cassowaries	[22:17:54] obviously some are more or less standard, if archaic, like 'blessèd' or 'learnèd'
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Cassowaries	[22:18:17] so it wouldn't surprise me if that's a common enough dialectal thing
2014-02-05 19:45:53	LeagueTRON	[23:07:33] Hi
2014-02-05 19:45:53	yeryry	[02:43:16] OED gives Brit. /pi:kt/ , U.S. /pikt/
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[04:52:45] theriel: yes, /'piːkt/ is normal for the usual meaning, but apparently the (rare) meaning 'sickly' is commonly pronounced /ˈpiːkɪd/
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[04:53:52] ie, a dialectal pronunciation that spread specifically for a specific, originally dialectal meaning
2014-02-05 19:45:53	yeryry	[05:09:24] That OED was for that specific meaning, which has its own entry now
2014-02-05 19:45:53	sytse	[06:57:06] yeryry: ah, k :)
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[13:46:44] hrm, interesting but i doubt almost anyone would differentiate it at this point
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[13:46:54] tired and sickly are just too close semantically
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[13:47:29] so you'll get either pikt or pik@d, depending on the dialect, but I doubt a single speaker will differentiate them both
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[13:47:43] unless they're highly educated and pedantic :D
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[13:47:59] I'm both highly educated and pedantic and I just say "peaky".
2014-02-05 19:45:53	theriel	[14:15:34] that works too
2014-02-05 19:45:53	 *	Leftmost [14:16:31] is also snarky.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Ranchy	[10:44:59] snoop lion rhymes "getting it on" with "six in the morning" not "dawn". That is interesting in a linguistic or poetic consideration.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	drbean	[12:33:45] Doesn't AAVE rhyme 'dawn' and 'on?' Southern English is supposed to.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Ranchy	[12:43:12] I rhyme it in my English.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Ranchy	[12:43:18] @drbean
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Ranchy	[12:43:57] I do'nt rhyme it with morning
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Ranchy	[12:44:31] iut's a loose rhyme
2014-02-05 19:45:53	YaRly	[01:11:51] What is the highest node in this clause: "but he even does it regularly" ? Is it "but" + "he even does it regularly"?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	YaRly	[01:12:46] Also, in a left aligned subtitle with two rows, it could make sense to put the line break after the "but" to reduce the distance the eye travels + from a psychological standpoint?

2014-02-05 19:45:53	zeto28	[15:05:07] does english have a word for 'rape' that etymologically traces back to proto-germanic?

2014-02-05 19:45:53	_andares	[16:30:43] hi, what is the history of alphabetical order in the Latin script?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	_andares	[16:31:10] it seems  pretty arbitrary and according to Wikipedia it is quite old, however there's no explanation offered for the specific ordering itself

2014-02-05 19:45:53	Oladon	[07:26:06] Nobody reads the "stick around" portion of the topic
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[07:27:31] Few enough read the ask part.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Parth	[07:38:05] Nobody reads.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	stapler	[12:03:56] hi
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[08:56:28] is there any online dictionary that's as ambitious as Wiktionary but more complete?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[09:12:03] It's pretty unlikely.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[09:24:47] ok, is there any online dictionary that's as ambitious as Wiktionary?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[09:25:23] OmegaWiki, to an extent. What are you after?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[09:46:18] Leftmost: oh, just curious, at this point.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[09:57:27] wow OmegaWiki looks like a good idea.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[09:58:03] If you ask me, its structure is useful for certain applications of NLP, but isn't good as a general dictionary.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[09:59:02] what is it missing?
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[09:59:43] It ignores the complexities of translating words. Its structure assumes that a translation will be a 100% match for the word it's applied to when that is frequently not the case.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[10:01:50] There's no way to say "this word is a translation for this word in language X, but not a translation for this other word in language Y which is also a translation for the word in language X" or "this word is frequently used to translate this word in language X, but it's not an exact match".
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[10:04:24] I guess I just want a uniform frontend to a lot of unilingual dictionaries.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[10:05:09] There's stardict, but it's got structural problems of its own. I think it's also unmaintained and just not very nice.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[10:07:30] for future reference, how did you find this stuff? I google "online multilingual dictionary" and I get a lot of crap.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Covered	[10:08:19] I think that wiktionary is the best that we have nowadays
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Leftmost	[10:08:54] Dictionaries are a big interest of mine. I used to contribute to OmegaWiki, which I found through talking to Wiktionary folks, and dealt with stardict as part of my work for them.
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Covered	[10:12:08] I had terminology classes so it's annoying...
2014-02-05 19:45:53	Covered	[10:12:12] but I like dictionaries
2014-02-05 19:45:53	zort	[10:12:26] terminology class?

2014-02-06 01:27:29	sytse	Covered: it's too bad OED-class dictionaries are usually very expensive (the dutch equivalent is freely accessible online, and the danish one too it seems, but the japanese one is as expensive as OED, and subscription-based too -- and the japanese and chinese equivalents for classical chinese aren't even accessible online yet it seems)
2014-02-06 01:29:19	sytse	(also, even OED-class dictionaries have problems of their own; the definitions don't actually correspond to how we visualise a word in our heads, but how we talk -about- the words which is necessarily more vague)
2014-02-06 01:31:51	sytse	also very interesting how there is a OED-class dictionary for classical chinese written in simplified chinese, and one written in japanese (with shinjitai/post-war orthography of course) but none in traditional chinese :]
2014-02-06 01:35:01	sytse	whereas the dutch OED-class dictionary uses prewar orthography (we've had a post-WWII orthography change too, albeit more minor than the japanese one, which did away with many etymological distinctions between kanji readings -- the dutch one only did away with one etymological phoneme distinction afaik)
2014-02-06 01:36:36	sytse	but that's mostly out of laziness I guess, because most of the current explanations were already written in the 19th century :-D
2014-02-06 01:39:46	sytse	(incidentally, the dictionary was never really finished before they could hire a horde of indians to go convert the whole thing into horrifying xml)
2014-02-06 02:39:16	sytse	Covered: oh yes, I forgot.. the OED-class french and german dictionaries are freely available online too. So the most brilliant dictionaries are freely available online, as long as you're not english/american/canadian/australian or chinese or japanese ;-)
2014-02-06 02:40:17	sytse	Covered: I found a classical OED (photographically compacted version) in a used bookstore, so I'm not complaining :]
2014-02-06 02:41:11	sytse	hm. zort is gone, too bad.
2014-02-06 02:42:54	yeryry	sytse: 9 double pages on one large page, or something?
2014-02-06 02:42:55	sytse	Leftmost: btw, didn't you forget webster1913? Not anywhere close to classical OED but 'online dictionary' and free
2014-02-06 02:43:55	sytse	yeryry: 4 per page. That's tiny enough as it is :-D
2014-02-06 02:44:19	sytse	yeryry: still 2 volumes weighing more than 3 kg apiece
2014-02-06 02:44:24	yeryry	2 A3 size.. yeah?
2014-02-06 02:44:36	sytse	yes.
2014-02-06 02:44:42	Leftmost	sytse, I wouldn't call webster1913 "ambitious", though. It's online and free, but its purpose isn't to create a modern, comprehensive multilingual dictionary. Or even a modern, comprehensive dictionary of English.
2014-02-06 02:44:43	yeryry	Ah, yeah I've seen those before
2014-02-06 02:45:13	Leftmost	The contents of the 1913 Webster have, in fact, been integrated into Wiktionary.
2014-02-06 02:45:25	sytse	Leftmost: well, the project itself was ambitious, it's just fallen out of copyright. It's only the online copy that wasn't 'ambitious'
2014-02-06 02:45:31	sytse	oh?
2014-02-06 02:45:51	Leftmost	http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Webster_1913
2014-02-06 02:46:46	Leftmost	sytse, I don't think that's ambitious in the way the original question intended.
2014-02-06 02:47:57	sytse	that's not nearly the whole webster1913 is it..
2014-02-06 02:48:06	sytse	ie, there's a lot missing compared to gcides version
2014-02-06 02:49:29	Leftmost	I have no idea, but it's also a hundred year old dictionary. English has changed significantly since then.
2014-02-06 02:50:38	sytse	(no quotations, no etymologies, no pronunciation keys)
2014-02-06 02:51:20	sytse	sure. Quite a large number of old meanings still live though. And a book from 1900 is perfectly legible
2014-02-06 02:52:14	Leftmost	Sure, but direct importation of obsolete meanings is counter to Wiktionary's purpose.
2014-02-06 02:53:08	sytse	yep. Not sure what we're arguing about though, wiktionary is awesome
2014-02-06 02:53:30	Leftmost	Oh, no doubt.
2014-02-06 02:54:32	sytse	(and doing anything more than what it does.. not a good idea as long as it doesn't fulfill its current purpose almost perfectly which it doesn't)

2014-02-06 09:18:36	Xuisce	ah

2014-02-06 09:25:06	Leftmost	I studied linguistics.

2014-02-06 09:25:18	Leftmost	I would say English is the only language in which I'm fluent.

2014-02-11 22:55:21	TheAmoebaWeeps	So, are there statistics for the percentage of borrowed words in Romance languages?
2014-02-11 22:55:48	TheAmoebaWeeps	The wikipedia article on Spanish says it's 60% latin and 40% other, but the only reference given seems kind of flimsy.
2014-02-11 22:57:16	TheAmoebaWeeps	or more specifically, 60% latin, and 10% gothic, 10% arabic, 10% greek, and 10% other.
2014-02-11 22:57:33	TheAmoebaWeeps	But I don't know if i trust those figures.

2014-02-11 23:13:48	TheAmoebaWeeps	Well, 100% of any given ethnic group will have foreign ancestry, so I guess it's a matter of how you divide that 100% up.
2014-02-11 23:14:01	tseno	:)
2014-02-11 23:14:09	TheAmoebaWeeps	Wait.
2014-02-11 23:14:15	TheAmoebaWeeps	This ancestry... how recent is it?
2014-02-11 23:14:23	TheAmoebaWeeps	100-200 years? 500? 1000?
2014-02-11 23:14:25	tseno	not very recent i suppose
2014-02-11 23:14:33	tseno	more than 500 i suppose
2014-02-11 23:14:34	TheAmoebaWeeps	Then maybe it has to do with the vikings.
2014-02-11 23:14:42	tseno	well it does obviously :)
2014-02-11 23:15:12	TheAmoebaWeeps	I bet 99% of bulgarians have some roman ancestry.
2014-02-11 23:15:26	TheAmoebaWeeps	or goth
2014-02-11 23:15:34	TheAmoebaWeeps	or some other really widespread group of ancient invaders

2014-02-11 23:19:18	TheAmoebaWeeps	I hear Icelandic is pretty close to Old Norse.

2014-02-11 23:27:05	tseno	well not particularly for me probably

2014-02-16 10:19:49	drbean	I guess if they resisted changes taking place, like refusing to use new words coming into the language, the idiolect would be more conservative.

2014-02-17 05:14:31	niska	sounds reasonable
2014-02-17 05:14:53	niska	you could also say that the union of two sets has size > 1 for the (b) case; not sure if useful

2014-02-17 23:02:09	oriba	is it possible to compare two small texts with programs, and rate the kind of texts to be rather scientifically or rather idologically?  And would that work with texts of about 12 ...16 kB? I did just a simple word histogram, and some items are popping up a littlebid. But I have no lingusitic background...
2014-02-17 23:02:36	oriba	can you recommend software for such a case? (Using Linux)

2014-03-17 06:16:11	Zylinx_	Is it possible to create a possible meaning for a made up word which would relate to some kind of language base
2014-03-17 06:16:33	Zylinx_	like brain storm of what the word could mean even though it has no meaning
2014-03-17 06:18:29	Leftmost	Not really sure what you're asking.
2014-03-17 06:19:58	Zylinx_	well my alias i made up a 10 or so years ago. Zylinx.  i never thaught it had a meaning i just made it up but someone registered the domain zylinx.com and redirected it their millitary training gear online shop
2014-03-17 06:20:28	Zylinx_	So i was just wondering, maybe it has some kind of meaning
2014-03-17 06:21:06	Leftmost	An intrinsic meaning, you mean?
2014-03-17 06:21:26	Zylinx_	yes
2014-03-17 06:22:21	Leftmost	It's well-accepted by linguists that words have no intrinsic meaning.
2014-03-17 06:24:32	Zylinx_	ok, if i understand intrinsic meaning. you mean a word inheriting its meaning from how it is structured or the letters its built from
2014-03-17 06:24:53	Leftmost	Yes.
2014-03-17 06:25:48	Zylinx_	Ah ok then, so unless zylinx has been defined somewhere to have a meaning its completely meaningless :p ?
2014-03-17 06:26:33	Zylinx_	i understand
2014-03-17 06:26:48	Leftmost	It could have meaning to you or to the people who registered the domain, but by and large, meaning is negotiated by speakers of the language.

2014-03-19 23:47:33	YYZ	I'm trying to think of a similar word in English
2014-03-19 23:48:14	sq	you can say it's a hieroglyph of sorts
2014-03-19 23:48:24	YYZ	of course i'm not a linguist either
2014-03-19 23:48:46	Leftmost	It's not an abbreviation?
2014-03-19 23:48:54	sq	since although you can guess the meaning from the letters present more often than not, you can't be sure
2014-03-19 23:49:33	sq	well most abbreviations are supposed to be guessed
2014-03-19 23:50:18	sq	and you don't abbreviate “god” in a religious text
2014-03-19 23:50:29	YYZ	abbreviations arn't (haha) pronounced the same as the word/words they abbreviate
2014-03-19 23:50:40	YYZ	at least in English
2014-03-19 23:51:16	YYZ	sq is saying that in certain arabic or slavic wore there's an abbreviation, but the pronunciation is the same
2014-03-19 23:51:20	YYZ	*words
2014-03-19 23:51:37	YYZ	it could be as if "can't" is pronounced "can not"
2014-03-19 23:51:48	Leftmost	That's a contraction, not an abbreviation.
2014-03-19 23:51:55	YYZ	right
2014-03-19 23:52:39	YYZ	so I guess it is an abbreviation, as in "Govt." is pronounced "government" regardless of how the "Govt." is spelled
2014-03-19 23:52:54	Leftmost	If I have a text that reads "The fence surrounds 26 sq. ft.", I would read it aloud as "The fence surrounds 26 square feet", not "The fence surrounds 26 squhfut."
2014-03-19 23:53:26	YYZ	sq, that's it, abbreviation!
2014-03-19 23:53:30	Leftmost	sq, is "God" what it says?
2014-03-19 23:53:59	Leftmost	Because that's a fairly common thing in religious texts. In Hebrew you have the Tetragrammaton.
2014-03-19 23:54:19	sq	it is
2014-03-19 23:54:33	sq	and iirc in hebrew there are/were no vowels
2014-03-19 23:54:50	sq	so yhwh is what you get either way
2014-03-19 23:55:05	sq	anyways, abberviations are there to save space
2014-03-19 23:55:14	Leftmost	Yes, but the Masoretic texts mark it to indicate it should be pronounced as "adonai".
2014-03-19 23:56:02	Leftmost	Anyhow, I'm not really clear on why this is distinguished from an abbreviation.
2014-03-19 23:56:05	sq	either way, tetragrammaton is probably not an abbreviation, is it
2014-03-19 23:56:07	YYZ	I detect another reason for not pronouncing or speaking the "tetragrammaton"
2014-03-19 23:56:18	Leftmost	No, it isn't.
2014-03-19 23:56:42	Leftmost	I'm saying that it could be a similar phenomenon in this case.
2014-03-19 23:57:20	YYZ	from wikipedia: The name YHWH may be derived from a verb that means "to be, to exist"
2014-03-19 23:59:10	YYZ	it's fundamentalist censorsip :D

2014-03-20 00:00:54	Leftmost	YYZ, I don't know that I follow, but at first blush that's dangerously close to a discussion about religion rather than language.
2014-03-20 00:01:17	Leftmost	sq, the connecting bar over the top is reminiscent of scribal abbreviations in languages that I'm familiar with.
2014-03-20 00:02:06	sq	yeah now that i posted the link..
2014-03-20 00:02:48	Leftmost	That's part of why I suggested abbreviations...
2014-03-20 00:03:39	YYZ	I find it interesting that the word comes from that verd meaing "to be, exist"

2014-03-21 11:07:07	drbean	Stressed syllable has falling intonation. Prior has rising intonation, or at least non falling.
2014-03-21 11:07:53	drbean	Japanese will extend the syllable.
2014-03-21 11:08:00	drbean	Don't know if Japanese is tonal.

2014-03-21 20:50:52	drbean	The 英 character used to transcribe the /ˈɪŋ/ in England is first tone in Chinese.
2014-03-21 20:51:27	theriel	i always find the "first/second/third" etc tone idea funny, dealing with African languages
2014-03-21 20:52:45	theriel	there it's not a matter of tone categories but rather tone levels.. Uduk for instance has H, M, and L, and then a TBU could be either H, M, L, LH, LM, MH, ML, HM, HL, or LHL in a few instances
2014-03-21 20:53:15	theriel	but i wouldn't say LHL is the "tenth" tone, it's just a sequence
2014-03-21 20:53:23	theriel	which ends up fitting onto a single vowel or consonant

2014-03-25 19:08:24	adnap	Hey
2014-03-25 19:08:39	theriel	hello
2014-03-25 19:08:48	adnap	Has anyone read "Syntactic Structures"?
2014-03-25 19:10:44	theriel	ok, not my area, i'll let someone else field the generative questions
2014-03-25 19:10:57	theriel	i'm quite anti-chomsky and generative linguistics
2014-03-25 19:14:07	adnap	theriel: Why?
2014-03-25 19:15:29	theriel	because it's basically been proven to be wrong? and lots of american still have their heads stuck in the sand about the whole idea
2014-03-25 19:15:50	theriel	they ignore the diversity of 7000 some languages and then stick to studying their own mother tongue and somehow think that you can understand how language works based on that
2014-03-25 19:16:04	theriel	the methodology is generally awful
2014-03-25 19:18:28	adnap	Do you mean that generative grammars have been unsuccessful in deciding the grammatical correctness of English sentences?
2014-03-25 19:19:03	theriel	i mean that they take arbitrary examples about the grammatical correctness of english, and extrapolate that to refer to all languages
2014-03-25 19:19:12	theriel	without properly checking whether it's the case
2014-03-25 19:19:33	theriel	http://edge.org/responses/what-scientific-idea-is-ready-for-retirement take a look at the one under "Universal Grammar"
2014-03-25 19:19:39	adnap	So, people have yet to model other languages with generative grammars?
2014-03-25 19:20:07	theriel	there's only one country with such a high amount of generative linguists.. the US
2014-03-25 19:20:13	theriel	they're a minority everywhere else
2014-03-25 19:20:29	adnap	That is not relevant
2014-03-25 19:20:38	theriel	some other languages have been modelled here and there, but rarely well
2014-03-25 19:20:54	theriel	but the problem is the cultural trend in the US of focusing only on US-related things
2014-03-25 19:21:18	theriel	that combined with the fact that generative linguistics is limited elsewhere means that there's a pretty low chance of other languages being modeled properly
2014-03-25 19:22:19	adnap	Okay, I want to change topics a bit
2014-03-25 19:22:29	adnap	First, I am interested in learning how English works
2014-03-25 19:23:17	adnap	As far as I understand it, grammar is a set of rules for describing language.
2014-03-25 19:23:29	theriel	sort of
2014-03-25 19:23:42	theriel	it's more complicated than that
2014-03-25 19:23:49	adnap	And I suppose the best grammar is the one the describes the most examples with the fewest exceptions
2014-03-25 19:23:56	adnap	*that describes
2014-03-25 19:24:25	theriel	languages in general have what's called fuzzy grammar
2014-03-25 19:24:45	theriel	grammatical constructions occur on a continuum, not on an absolute scale
2014-03-25 19:25:17	adnap	I want to learn about English grammar and phonetics. I want to learn about the best rules we have.
2014-03-25 19:25:30	adnap	So, can you recommend a book to read?
2014-03-25 19:25:57	theriel	Lakoff (1973) summarzies the conclusions of this line of research as follows:
2014-03-25 19:26:00	theriel	Rules of grammar do not simply apply or fail to apply; rather they apply to a degree. Grammatical elements are not simply members or nonmembers of grammatical categories; rather they are members to a degree. Grammatical constructions are not simply islands or non-islands; rather they are islands to a degree.
2014-03-25 19:26:05	theriel	 Grammatical constructios are not simply environments or non-environments for rules; rather rthey may be environments to a degree. Grammatical phenomena form hierarchies which are largely constant from speaker to speaker, and in many cases, from language to language. Different speakers (and different languages) will have different acceptability thresholds along these hierarchies.
2014-03-25 19:26:32	adnap	This guy is so redundant
2014-03-25 19:26:46	adnap	He does specify what "a degree" is
2014-03-25 19:26:51	theriel	that's the summary of an entire book
2014-03-25 19:27:03	adnap	I searched your link for "universal grammar" and didn't find anything
2014-03-25 19:27:24	adnap	Nevermind. I found it
2014-03-25 19:27:29	adnap	I had "match case" on
2014-03-25 19:27:56	theriel	the one by benjamin bergen
2014-03-25 19:30:03	adnap	Is "Lakoff (1973)" the book you are recommending me to read on English grammar and phonetics?
2014-03-25 19:30:14	-->	rusoved (~rusoved@cpe-184-57-7-62.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined ##linguistics
2014-03-25 19:31:02	theriel	no, i was quoting it
2014-03-25 19:31:18	theriel	do you want an introduction to linguistics or an introduction to english?
2014-03-25 19:31:37	theriel	as in what is linguistics about, with english examples, or what is english about?
2014-03-25 19:34:14	adnap	I want "what is English about", but I want to know anything from linguistics that might be helpful for understanding the answer to that question
2014-03-25 19:35:31	adnap	Someone else suggested http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/grammar-and-syntax/cambridge-grammar-english-language I found http://www.amazon.com/How-English-Works-Linguistic-Introduction/dp/0205032281 myself
2014-03-25 19:38:15	theriel	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9706227/Payne%20-%20Exploring%20language%20structure.pdf that one is more about linguistics than english but it assumes a background of american undergraduate, and frames things in that way
2014-03-25 19:38:25	theriel	it's worth a perusal at least
2014-03-25 19:40:30	adnap	I want something that is comprehensive on a basic level. Something that covers all topics of English, but is not too long. Something that I can branch out from
2014-03-25 19:40:45	adnap	Something that assumes I know nothing
2014-03-25 19:40:54	theriel	yeah i dunno, english is my mother tongue but i've mostly been bored by it, to be honest
2014-03-25 19:41:11	theriel	Leftmost: ?
2014-03-25 19:41:13	theriel	you there?
2014-03-25 19:41:21	theriel	he (or other people here) may have been ideas
2014-03-25 19:41:59	adnap	Maybe it's better to learn English by just trying to understand things written/spoken in English than to learn rules
2014-03-25 19:42:53	adnap	I just thought learning rules would help me organize information
2014-03-25 19:43:54	theriel	are you a native speaker?
2014-03-25 19:44:20	adnap	Yes
2014-03-25 19:44:40	adnap	I just want to be a good English teacher
2014-03-25 19:45:01	adnap	I don't know what I know
2014-03-25 19:46:21	theriel	ah ok.. so you you want to learn about teaching english, which is very different
2014-03-25 19:46:40	theriel	teaching english to native or non-native speakers?
2014-03-25 19:46:49	adnap	Non-native
2014-03-25 19:47:53	theriel	http://www.amazon.co.uk/TEFL-books-Essential-English-teachers/lm/ERRZES7EYYK that's the sort of thing you'd want to see then
2014-03-25 19:47:58	adnap	I saw books on Amazon related to teaching English to non-nativce speakers, but I got a bad feeling about this sort of approach. Like, when you teach biology, there's just one subject, and it doesn't matter who is learning it
2014-03-25 19:48:16	theriel	hrm well it's not quite the same
2014-03-25 19:48:31	theriel	we actually do store native languages vs second languages in different parts of the brain
2014-03-25 19:48:46	theriel	whereas we'll all mostly store biology in the same part of the brain
2014-03-25 19:48:50	adnap	I want to read something that takes a scientific approach to English
2014-03-25 19:50:33	adnap	English comprehension is testable.
2014-03-25 19:50:49	adnap	So it should be possible to compare various methods of teaching
2014-03-25 19:51:07	theriel	actually i did think of something, lemme find it
2014-03-25 19:51:25	adnap	But I guess there is no definitive description of English
2014-03-25 19:51:48	adnap	Even though it seems like people are trying to agree on one
2014-03-25 19:52:02	theriel	goldberg constructions - a construction grammar approach to argument structure
2014-03-25 19:52:07	theriel	that's about english despite the title

2014-03-27 00:21:16	theriel	oh, didn't realize we got another finn in here at some point
2014-03-27 00:22:09	nortti	how many finns there are, in here?
2014-03-27 00:22:28	theriel	you, and i might count as a half? :P

2014-03-27 00:22:38	theriel	naturalized finn anyway
2014-03-27 00:23:35	theriel	nortti: joo
2014-03-27 00:23:38	theriel	irc was invented here
2014-03-27 00:24:03	nortti	I know, I live literally a 1km from oulu uni
2014-03-27 00:24:43	theriel	aha
2014-03-27 00:25:16	theriel	was just having a discussion yesterday about how easily pohjanmaa people can make the difference between p and b compared to the rest of the country
2014-03-27 00:25:35	nortti	hmm, never though about that
2014-03-27 00:25:41	theriel	i've heard lots of oulu people say istanpul and pileet, and some really can't make the difference even when trying
2014-03-27 00:26:39	nortti	yeah, it is interesting how one doesn't realize the differeces between phonemes that one doesn't know that well
2014-03-27 00:27:13	theriel	well it's normal in general for that sort of thing, but i think pohjanmaa stands out with p/b in particular
2014-03-27 00:27:24	theriel	and then everywhere outside of helsinki/turku for k/g i suppose
2014-03-27 00:29:26	nortti	also one that is almost universal as far as I see, t/þ/th
2014-03-27 00:30:00	theriel	yeah but ð/þ are foreign phonemes to finns.. b is a finnish phoneme in helsinki
2014-03-27 00:30:31	nortti	foreign phoneme outside of it :P
2014-03-27 00:30:32	theriel	pussi vs bussi
2014-03-27 00:30:37	theriel	nice minimal pair
2014-03-27 00:32:00	theriel	i dunno, that's why i brought up the pohjanmaa thing.. it seems like that part of the country makes less of a distinction than in other parts

2014-03-28 10:42:05	x86_64	hello
2014-03-28 11:00:47	x86_64	in phonetics what is the difference between these sounds: /ø/ /œ/ /ə/ and a 'gamma' like symbol? and many other
2014-03-28 11:05:39	cntrational	x86_64: how much phonetics do you know?
2014-03-28 11:05:51	x86_64	not much
2014-03-28 11:06:13	cntrational	and i assume you mean [ɤ]?
2014-03-28 11:06:19	x86_64	yes
2014-03-28 11:06:28	cntrational	okay, what languages do you speak?
2014-03-28 11:06:34	x86_64	but I know enough to make a conlang
2014-03-28 11:06:43	x86_64	English thai
2014-03-28 11:06:48	cntrational	hmm, okay
2014-03-28 11:06:51	x86_64	fluently
2014-03-28 11:07:00	cntrational	[ə] is the English "uh" sound
2014-03-28 11:07:08	x86_64	ok
2014-03-28 11:07:10	cntrational	like the two a's in "America"
2014-03-28 11:07:45	x86_64	hmm mm
2014-03-28 11:07:47	cntrational	do you know what [e] and [ɛ] are?
2014-03-28 11:08:52	x86_64	I don't know the difference either
2014-03-28 11:09:48	cntrational	hmm
2014-03-28 11:10:21	cntrational	[e] is pronounced with your tongue nearer to the top of your mouth ("higher" in linguistics)
2014-03-28 11:10:33	cntrational	[ɛ] is lower in your mouth
2014-03-28 11:10:47	cntrational	the Spanish e is [e]
2014-03-28 11:11:00	x86_64	ok
2014-03-28 11:11:05	cntrational	the English e like in "bet" is [ɛ]
2014-03-28 11:12:05	cntrational	the a in English "late" is pronounced [ej], meaning that it starts off with an [e], but slides into an [j] sound
2014-03-28 11:12:15	<--	iLogicalus (~iLogicalu@unaffiliated/ilogicalus) has quit (Read error: Connection timed out)
2014-03-28 11:12:19	cntrational	(depends on accent, though)
2014-03-28 11:12:42	x86_64	ok
2014-03-28 11:12:55	x86_64	do go on
2014-03-28 11:13:44	 *	x86_64 still pronounce late and bet same
2014-03-28 11:13:51	cntrational	anyway, [ø] and [œ] are the rounded versions of [e] and [ɛ] -- meaning that they're pronounced with the tongue in the [e, ɛ] position respectively, but the lips are rounded like when you pronounce [u]
2014-03-28 11:15:21	x86_64	hmm
2014-03-28 11:17:18	cntrational	[ɤ] is similar
2014-03-28 11:17:38	cntrational	it's the unrounded version of [ɔ] (the sound in English "law")
2014-03-28 11:18:27	x86_64	hmm
2014-03-28 11:19:35	cntrational	er, no, wait
2014-03-28 11:19:51	cntrational	[ʌ] is the unrounded version of [ɔ]
2014-03-28 11:20:02	cntrational	[ɤ] is unrounded [o]
2014-03-28 11:20:41	x86_64	i see
2014-03-28 11:20:49	x86_64	thanks cnt

2014-03-31 14:21:30	TheAmoebaWeeps	I found this old book about linguistics: https://archive.org/details/lalinguistiqu00hove
2014-03-31 14:21:47	TheAmoebaWeeps	is there any use in reading old linguistics books or are they all obsolete?
2014-03-31 14:40:26	theriel	there's definitely some good ones out there
2014-03-31 14:40:40	theriel	can't speak for that particular one though
2014-03-31 14:41:50	TheAmoebaWeeps	well in general are old linguistics books full of obsolete material?

2014-03-31 16:03:15	Leftmost	TheAmoebaWeeps, it would depend a lot on the material covered by the book.
2014-03-31 16:06:18	theriel	i have some grammars from the 1930's which are really excellent
2014-03-31 16:12:11	theriel	also, even some stuff from the same time period can be of mixed quality
2014-03-31 16:13:06	theriel	boas has an article from 1911, race and language, which is excellent
2014-03-31 16:13:20	theriel	in some ways i'd consider it well ahead of its time, to be honest
2014-03-31 16:13:39	theriel	it was probably weird in those days to NOT be racist
2014-03-31 16:18:46	TheAmoebaWeeps	ah, yes I read that in an anthology of linguistics work
2014-03-31 16:18:49	TheAmoebaWeeps	works*
2014-03-31 16:21:35	theriel	routledge language and cultural theory reader? :D

2014-03-31 16:24:24	TheAmoebaWeeps	I'm not sure you can even find it on the Internet
2014-03-31 16:24:25	theriel	ah
2014-03-31 16:24:31	theriel	haven heard of that one
2014-03-31 16:25:02	TheAmoebaWeeps	I think it's really obscure
2014-03-31 16:25:07	TheAmoebaWeeps	I found it at my library
2014-03-31 16:25:41	theriel	any good?
2014-03-31 16:26:12	TheAmoebaWeeps	don't remember
2014-03-31 16:26:14	TheAmoebaWeeps	got it a while ago
2014-03-31 16:26:30	theriel	there seems to be one from the 60's
2014-03-31 16:26:43	theriel	called classics in linguistics, by donald hayden, paul alworth, and gary tate
2014-03-31 16:26:50	TheAmoebaWeeps	could be it
2014-03-31 16:26:54	TheAmoebaWeeps	I remember it was an old book
2014-03-31 16:27:01	TheAmoebaWeeps	it had a blue cover with various writing systems
2014-03-31 16:27:18	theriel	amazon says no image available
2014-03-31 16:27:23	theriel	so can't even compare that
