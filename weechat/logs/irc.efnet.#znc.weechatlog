2013-09-08 15:42:07	jason	followed the steps
2013-09-08 15:42:16	Domin	2. Create an empty .oidentd.conf in the homedir of the user you are running ZNC as (this step may be unnecessary) 
2013-09-08 15:42:16	Domin	touch ~/.oidentd.conf
2013-09-08 15:42:16	Domin	chmod 644 ~/.oidentd.conf
2013-09-08 15:42:35	jason	yeah followed that to a tea :)
2013-09-08 15:42:44	Domin	okie look to see if its running
2013-09-08 15:43:15	Domin	if you dont know how to do that for your os, you might what to look that up
2013-09-08 15:44:04	Domin	but generly there would be an process named oidend running

2013-09-17 08:40:29	Spitteh	Heya.
2013-09-17 08:41:01	Spitteh	If I have two clients connected to the same ZNC user, is there a way to get messages sent by one client to appear on the other client's screen?
2013-09-17 08:41:24	lahwran	they should
2013-09-17 08:41:28	lahwran	unless it's a PM
2013-09-17 08:41:33	Spitteh	PMs, sorry, yeah.
2013-09-17 08:42:00	Spitteh	And preferably not the method mentioned at http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#How_to_store_private_messages_even_when_user_is_attached.2C_so_other_clients_can_see_them.3F
2013-09-17 08:42:04	lahwran	you might be able to do something clever about pretending PMs are channels to the client, but it's require a module
2013-09-17 08:42:48	lahwran	bitlbee's method is unacceptable - pretend that the messages you send to the other user actually came from them
2013-09-17 08:44:35	Spitteh	http://wiki.znc.in/Privmsg seems like it should work then?

2013-09-19 01:33:11	danijel	Hello, a question. Been trying to figure this out for the last few hours and I'm missin a piece of the puzzle. I want to limit namechanges so that they can only go from %nick% to afk_%nick% and vice versa. I edited the "NICK" case in IRCSock.cpp and return when the namechange does not follow this rule effectively blocking it. But the namechange DOES to through, atleast internally in ZNC, clients 
2013-09-19 01:33:11	danijel	still see the old name. 
2013-09-19 01:33:42	danijel	Anyone have any idea where I have to do some additional fiddlin to prevent the internal namechange from happenin?
2013-09-19 01:33:47	danijel	sorry for the wall of text :)
2013-09-19 01:35:11	danijel	Using ZNC 1.0, the condition that I'm editing starts at line 466 in IRCSock.cpp
2013-09-19 01:37:48	@SilverLeo	so doing this in ircsock.cpp means the nick was already changed on the server
2013-09-19 01:39:08	@SilverLeo	if you've locked the users modules you could make a module that blocks the command before it gets to the server at all
2013-09-19 01:39:33	@SilverLeo	something similar to this old thing http://people.znc.in/~psychon/znc/modules/block_part.cpp
2013-09-19 01:41:40	danijel	Ah, so IRCSock gets the command string after it has already been sent to the server?
2013-09-19 01:42:45	danijel	I'll try modifying the block part example! 
2013-09-19 01:44:16	@SilverLeo	ircsock.cpp mainly handles the stuff that we receive from the irc server
2013-09-19 01:44:41	danijel	Ah, no wonder I couldnt do anything there then
2013-09-19 01:46:19	danijel	thanks for the tips, ill try makin the module

2013-09-20 01:56:52	NeverHere	:P
2013-09-20 01:57:00	NeverHere	so, i got reverse DNS
2013-09-20 01:57:08	haltdef_	same!
2013-09-20 01:57:10	haltdef_	^5
2013-09-20 01:57:24	NeverHere	and i tried to make a bindhost, 
2013-09-20 01:57:44	NeverHere	so that when you get on irc it says ident@dns.org
2013-09-20 01:57:56	NeverHere	but it says, i can't connect to irc
2013-09-20 01:57:57	NeverHere	:/
2013-09-20 01:58:47	@psychon	"bindhost" just selects the ip address to use, you know that?
2013-09-20 01:58:58	@psychon	(and doesnt do anything useful at all if you only have a single public ip)
2013-09-20 01:59:11	NeverHere	didn't know that
2013-09-20 01:59:12	NeverHere	:P
2013-09-20 01:59:39	NeverHere	i thought you could use bindhost to change what people see in irc when they /whois
2013-09-20 01:59:45	NeverHere	so instead of my ip address
2013-09-20 01:59:49	NeverHere	they see my domain name
2013-09-20 01:59:56	NeverHere	bc thats much prettier
2013-09-20 01:59:58	NeverHere	>.>
2013-09-20 02:00:51	@psychon	yeah, that's basically what it does
2013-09-20 02:01:05	@psychon	the IRCd sees a connection coming from 109.234.106.54
2013-09-20 02:01:17	@psychon	it looks up the PTR record of that domain and gets back "psybnc.out.znc.in"
2013-09-20 02:01:28	@psychon	then it resolves that again to the ip address and gets 109.234.106.54
2013-09-20 02:01:34	NeverHere	lol
2013-09-20 02:01:47	NeverHere	so it doesn't matter? as ircd will just turn it around again
2013-09-20 02:01:49	NeverHere	?
2013-09-20 02:01:49	@psychon	now, because it ended up at the same ip address that it started with, it uses "psybnc.out.znc.in" instead of using 109.234.106.54
2013-09-20 02:01:56	NeverHere	oh
2013-09-20 02:01:57	NeverHere	ok
2013-09-20 02:02:27	@psychon	if any part of that fails (e.g. no PTR record or the ip address at the end doesnt match the one that it started with), it will just use the ip address as host name
2013-09-20 02:02:46	NeverHere	so my ip address is 66.191.113.198 as you can tell 
2013-09-20 02:02:55	NeverHere	and my domain name is eternalproject.org
2013-09-20 02:02:59	@psychon	the PTR for that eternalproject.org
2013-09-20 02:03:04	NeverHere	and it does reverse point i did the host command 
2013-09-20 02:03:09	@psychon	and that one resolves to 199.34.228.58
2013-09-20 02:03:14	NeverHere	oh
2013-09-20 02:03:17	NeverHere	ok

2013-09-20 02:03:22	@psychon	and since 199.34.228.58 != 66.191.113.198, the IRCd doesnt use the domain
2013-09-20 02:03:26	NeverHere	right
2013-09-20 02:03:27	NeverHere	so
2013-09-20 02:03:32	NeverHere	well ok we have 2 ips
2013-09-20 02:03:36	NeverHere	that one is the webserver
2013-09-20 02:03:45	NeverHere	and the znc is the 66 one
2013-09-20 02:03:48	NeverHere	which is
2013-09-20 02:03:52	NeverHere	znc.eternalproject.org
2013-09-20 02:05:39	NeverHere	so is there any way to do that one?
2013-09-20 02:07:07	@psychon	yeah, just use znc.eternalproject.org as the PTR for the ip that znc can/should use
2013-09-20 02:07:13	@psychon	(and have that resolve back to the ip)
2013-09-20 02:07:45	NeverHere	how do i use that as the ptr?
2013-09-20 02:07:55	NeverHere	<--- noob
2013-09-20 02:07:55	NeverHere	:P
2013-09-20 02:08:17	NeverHere	my isp said they can only point the ip back to the domain, not a sub domain
2013-09-20 02:08:26	NeverHere	unless
2013-09-20 02:08:48	NeverHere	i can configure the A record of the *@ to point to ZNC instead of www.
2013-09-20 02:08:52	NeverHere	?
2013-09-20 02:14:10	@psychon	then that is a problem with your ISP, nothing that I can help with
2013-09-20 02:14:21	@psychon	and no, I never messed with any dns records either
2013-09-20 02:15:32	NeverHere	imma try something

2013-09-20 23:05:33	FLD	interesting pitfall i noticed when using both the "keepnick" and "nickserv" modules
2013-09-20 23:07:51	FLD	if your internet connection gets cut and comes back and znc connects back to freenode before your old connections has had time to timeout and you are force to take another nick and you happen to be on a channel that quiets non-indentified users the keepnick gets stuck in an infinite loop of trying to get your nickname back but failing to realize the server is not letting you because you have not yet identified
2013-09-20 23:12:40	tomaw	Use the SASL module instead of the nickserv one
2013-09-20 23:18:16	@psychon	doesnt sound too bad to me, that's not a busy loop
2013-09-20 23:18:22	@psychon	keepnick just tries every x seconds
2013-09-20 23:18:36	@psychon	also, this has nothing to do with keepnick, does it?
2013-09-20 23:18:46	@psychon	hm... or am I misunderstanding something?
2013-09-20 23:21:13	tomaw	quieting unidentified users stops them from changing nicks

2013-09-20 23:26:19	@psychon	well, other networks have channel mode +N for "no one may change nick", dont they?
2013-09-20 23:27:23	lahwran	it's really "nickserv should be more proactive trying to log in"

2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[17:39:26] hey
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[17:39:31] anyone feels like writing a changelog?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	DAUK1	[18:33:43] Hi there! I'm a big ole hairy noob and need help! I was given znc by someone and I'm a bit thick, can't see how to get it connect to quakenet
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:02:27] Is it possible to change the main port ZNC uses?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:02:50] whats a "main port"?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:02:57] are you looking for /znc addport and /znc delport?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:03:48] I currently have the port set to 6667, and want to change it, but how do I remove 6667 afterwards?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:04:24] /znc delport 6667
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:04:38] Oh, it's just that it didn't look like I could do that from the WebUI >.>
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:04:51] uhm
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:04:58] from the WebUI: dunno if it is possible
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:05:09] looks like it
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:05:20] Hrm, I'll just do it that way anyways
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:16:18] Where is the file that holds the text for the main page (while logged out)?
2013-09-26 22:14:43	Durrck	[20:16:18] i.e. "Welcome to ZNC's web interface"
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:18:29] grep says webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.html
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:18:36] s/html/tmpl/
2013-09-26 22:14:43	ZNCLinker	[20:18:36] psychon meant: “grep says webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.tmpl”
2013-09-26 22:14:43	@psychon	[20:19:03] and the above filelist says that this is installed to /usr/share/znc/webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.tmpl

2013-09-28 22:45:08	jantman	this might be an edge case, but anyone else have problems with fail2ban, with ZNC running behind a load balancer? (and maybe with irssi clients?)
2013-09-28 22:55:15	@DGandalf	How would you load balance it?
2013-09-28 23:09:29	ZNCLinker	[znc] jantman opened issue #410: fail2ban log and unban  http://git.io/vbBEPQ
2013-09-28 23:16:45	jantman	DGandalf: I *am* load balancing it
2013-09-28 23:17:07	@DGandalf	What do you mean by that?
2013-09-28 23:17:20	jantman	looks like the issue I'm having is with SNAT, znc sees every client as having the same IP address (that of the load balancer), and therefore messes with fail2ban
2013-09-28 23:17:53	@DGandalf	So you load balancing clients, not ZNC?
2013-09-28 23:17:58	jantman	DGandalf: ok sorry... I'm not load balancing between multiple ZNC instances, but I'm having my clients connect to a load balancer VIP and that forwards to ZNC
2013-09-28 23:18:14	nausea	hum
2013-09-28 23:18:21	nausea	so 
2013-09-28 23:18:59	nausea	what's the benefit of doing that?
2013-09-28 23:19:06	nausea	what you balance is the initial tcp handshake, right? connections don't jump between instances or anything
2013-09-28 23:19:58	jantman	right
2013-09-28 23:20:41	jantman	can't say there's a distinct "benefit"... but it's required for our network setup
2013-09-28 23:21:09	jantman	so... I'm thinking about forking znc and adding logging to the fail2ban module, since there doesn't seem to be any
2013-09-28 23:21:40	jantman	though I'm a little unsure of whether it should be internal to fail2ban (essentially reimplementing a lot of adminlog) or somehow send to adminlog
2013-09-28 23:22:03	@DGandalf	Commands which show current state and remove one of IPs would be nice
2013-09-28 23:22:24	@DGandalf	Not sure about "log"
2013-09-28 23:22:51	jantman	what I'm running is a private server, so honestly I *want* a log of every client that's banned...
2013-09-28 23:23:05	jantman	not just for debugging purposes, but security too...
2013-09-28 23:23:30	jantman	but yeah, I'd also like admin commands... though those are way past my knowledge of c++
2013-09-28 23:23:39	@DGandalf	We just need better logging system
2013-09-28 23:23:59	@DGandalf	If to make it only for one module, it's no so useful
2013-09-28 23:24:41	jantman	agreed
2013-09-28 23:25:11	jantman	but I think I can probably come up with a patch that does it for fail2ban, either internally or with adminlog
2013-09-28 23:25:18	jantman	I don't think I can do much more than that
2013-09-28 23:27:45	nausea	so I get it
2013-09-28 23:27:48	nausea	the ips fail2ban sees
2013-09-28 23:27:52	nausea	are those from the lb
2013-09-28 23:28:16	jantman	yeah
2013-09-28 23:28:18	nausea	you need the equivalente of the X-Forwarded-For http header :p
2013-09-28 23:28:24	nausea	*-e
2013-09-28 23:28:26	jantman	no, I can fix that
2013-09-28 23:28:31	jantman	in the load balancer
2013-09-28 23:28:48	jantman	but the issue still remains that I *happen* to know that's the problem and the fix... 
2013-09-28 23:28:49	nausea	really? :o
2013-09-28 23:29:04	jantman	but I'd really like some logs to back that up...
2013-09-28 23:29:29	nausea	wait, can fail2ban see the ips that originally connected to the load balancer if it's the load balancer thats connecting to znc?
2013-09-28 23:30:35	jantman	I can make it do that...
2013-09-28 23:33:11	jantman	set the host that fail2ban is running on to use the LB as its default route, and then tell the LB to setup a SNAT pool, which will pass the original client IP...
2013-09-28 23:35:17	@DGandalf	Why do you need NAT at all instead of IPv6?
2013-09-28 23:36:45	jantman	um... because we're on an IPv4 network, and SNAT is how F5 BigIP LTMs work...

2013-09-29 13:31:35	jarryd	is there anyway to reduce the delay from when znc is started, to when clients connect
2013-09-29 13:33:19	@SilverLeo	znc has no control over clients
2013-09-29 13:33:28	jarryd	well, i mean znc -> server
2013-09-29 13:34:03	@SilverLeo	ConnectDelay, ServerThrottle
2013-09-29 13:34:32	jarryd	yeah, i've got each set to 60 and 0
2013-09-29 13:34:53	jarryd	some servers are taking like ~20 minutes to reconnect after restarting 
2013-09-29 13:36:36	@SilverLeo	i use ConnectDelay = 1 and ServerThrottle = 60, and no identd, so each network gets connected pretty much instantly
2013-09-29 13:37:22	@SilverLeo	so what does *status say about the network that takes 20min?
2013-09-29 13:37:23	@SilverLeo	is it trying to connect and fails or what?
2013-09-29 13:38:04	jarryd	it's like the socket is idle
2013-09-29 13:38:12	jarryd	then after a while it times out
2013-09-29 13:38:27	jarryd	there's no errors though
2013-09-29 13:39:30	@SilverLeo	which version of znc?
2013-09-29 13:39:38	jarryd	just pulled the latest git
2013-09-29 13:39:41	@SilverLeo	you could try running znc with --debug to see what it's doing
2013-09-29 13:43:16	 *	jarryd tries
2013-09-29 13:44:08	jarryd	ha, looks like it was my serverthrottle setting
2013-09-29 13:44:32	jarryd	changed it from 0 and it connects all of them straight away

2013-09-30 13:40:16	KindOne	if you have 1.0, just add another network inside the user and create another connections using username/network:password
2013-09-30 13:41:05	kezu_	how dfo i do this from the web interface
2013-09-30 13:41:19	kezu_	sorry i do not understand add another networ?
2013-09-30 13:41:24	kezu_	sorry i do not understand add another network?
2013-09-30 13:42:27	KindOne	much simpler via *status, /msg *status addnetwork freenode ; /server ip:port username/freenode:password ; /msg *status addserver irc.freenode.net

2013-09-30 14:33:39	kezu_	do i create a new user?
2013-09-30 14:33:41	@psychon	I guess the adduser command needs an argument
2013-09-30 14:36:16	kezu_	i have setup it connects to a server and no0w would like to connect it to a second server and channel too
2013-09-30 14:36:23	kezu_	is this what it is designed for?
2013-09-30 14:36:49	kezu_	do i need to create a different user
2013-09-30 14:37:37	@psychon	one user has a single irc connection
2013-09-30 14:39:31	kezu_	to one server?
2013-09-30 14:41:43	@psychon	to one server
2013-09-30 14:42:38	kezu_	and i can not have duplicate user names?

2013-09-30 14:42:56	@psychon	and I dont see how that would be a problem anyway
2013-09-30 14:43:09	kezu_	so i can not connect with the same server with the same user name?

2013-09-30 16:51:28	kezu_	anyone know how to start and stop znc?
2013-09-30 16:51:45	kezu_	znc stop and sudo services znc stop not working
2013-09-30 16:55:14	meingtsla	You could create your own init script and then be able to 'service znc stop'
2013-09-30 16:56:12	meingtsla	Or, perhaps easier, you can just run znc on the command line (I believe it backgrounds itself?)
2013-09-30 16:56:27	meingtsla	Then find its pid and kill it when you want to stop it. I think.
2013-09-30 16:57:23	kezu_	there is no stop command?\
2013-09-30 16:57:31	kezu_	used znc to start it'
2013-09-30 16:57:47	meingtsla	You can stop znc from within znc
2013-09-30 16:58:10	meingtsla	think it's /quote znc shutdown or /msg *znc shutdown
2013-09-30 16:59:26	meingtsla	apparently sending SIGINT to znc causes it to shutdown in the same manner
2013-09-30 17:00:36	meingtsla	Hm. Check [[Running ZNC as a system daemon]] perhaps (that particular script is for Debian)

2013-09-30 17:01:56	kezu_	how?
2013-09-30 17:01:59	meingtsla	that sends a SIGINT, which works as I mentioned
2013-09-30 17:02:13	kezu_	why no command to stop it?
2013-09-30 17:02:15	meingtsla	pkill -2 znc
2013-09-30 17:02:32	meingtsla	that will send sigint to all znc processes

2013-10-02 06:15:03	KindOne	it should be logging stuff you send though znc ..
2013-10-02 06:18:06	Meson	Strange thing is not I notice new log files with my messages. Capitalization of the channel is wrong putting it in a new file.
2013-10-02 06:18:51	Meson	Let me go back and look at this
2013-10-02 06:21:04	Meson	For the record it looks like the "incoming" messages are logged under the channel with the name in all lowercase.

2013-10-02 21:00:41	Rinzler	quick question, why do some channels become disabled in znc after a while?
2013-10-02 21:04:14	Rinzler	nm, looks like the channels that become disabled are channels with keys. must be getting disconnected and reconnecting without the key, therefore znc is unable to join. anyone know how to add channel keys to channel config in znc?
2013-10-02 21:09:07	rwxr	do it in webadmin
2013-10-02 21:09:16	rwxr	i usually don't store keys
2013-10-02 21:09:55	rwxr	after a split or disconnect i get "unable to join #chan: incorrect key"
2013-10-02 21:10:08	Rinzler	i don't think i've ever used webadmin, will check it out
2013-10-02 21:10:14	rwxr	just disconnect and reconnect to znc and you will rejoin chan
2013-10-02 21:11:03	Rinzler	that's usually what i do, but the time between disconnects and reconnects is several days
2013-10-02 21:11:15	Rinzler	and when i reconnect all channels are rejoined except those with keys
2013-10-02 21:11:40	Rinzler	err, rather still joined w/ buffer playback

2013-10-03 00:18:10	MarkyP	looking now

2013-10-03 00:27:16	@SilverLeo	so your host resolves to the ipv6 and the ipv6 resolves back to the host?
2013-10-03 00:28:31	MarkyP	ah no
2013-10-03 00:28:40	MarkyP	it doesnt resolve back
2013-10-03 00:28:49	MarkyP	ipv4 or v6 doh
2013-10-03 00:28:58	MarkyP	its showing kimsufi domain now
2013-10-03 00:31:35	MarkyP	i thought just setting the host as the ip would work how do i get it to resolve back to the host
2013-10-03 00:33:51	@SilverLeo	it's a simple reverse dns entry, a PTR-record
2013-10-03 00:35:07	MarkyP	host mark.gaf.me.uk
2013-10-03 00:35:07	MarkyP	mark.gaf.me.uk has address 94.23.40.104

2013-10-03 00:35:39	MarkyP	thats not right is it, im new to this just wanted a vhost
2013-10-03 00:36:42	@SilverLeo	for ipv4, that wouldn't work since mark.gaf.me.uk doesnt match ks370216.kimsufi.com.
2013-10-03 00:37:10	@SilverLeo	and for ipv6, 2001:41d0:2:2968::1 doesn't have a reverse at all
2013-10-03 00:38:09	MarkyP	i just pointed both ips to the domain thought that would be it
2013-10-03 00:38:40	MarkyP	should have looked in to it i guess 1st
2013-10-03 00:42:13	MarkyP	ill let them know i want a ptr record

2013-10-03 13:55:48	idahodude	I want to make a bnc for our chat users, but only allow them to connect to our network
2013-10-03 14:01:38	KindOne	addserver, nope, add a second network server, nope
2013-10-03 14:01:51	KindOne	addserver, nope, add a second network server, you can *
2013-10-03 14:02:56	KindOne	you would need to write a patch to prevent people from changing the server address.
2013-10-03 14:03:15	SourceX	iirc someone already has/had one somewhere
2013-10-03 14:03:57	SourceX	or maybe it wasn't fully compatible with the webui or something

2013-10-05 05:28:05	lahwran	psychon: I refuse to click that link for moral reasons
2013-10-05 05:28:12	gedge	running irssi, I can see nothing on the website saying how I get a /znc command
2013-10-05 05:28:23	SourceX	rofl psychon
2013-10-05 05:28:37	lahwran	gedge: most irc clients will just ask the server to deal with any unknown commands
2013-10-05 05:28:53	@psychon	gedge: /quote znc
2013-10-05 05:29:14	@psychon	gedge: or just query to *status (/znc is equivalent to /msg *status, /znc *foo equivalent to /msg *foo)
2013-10-05 05:29:25	@psychon	lahwran: that's ok with me :)
2013-10-05 05:29:32	gedge	makes sense, thanks
2013-10-05 05:30:32	gedge	also, I added one network at startup time (--makeconfig) but am now adding networks via /msg *status
2013-10-05 05:30:37	gedge	wow, painful
2013-10-05 05:30:54	gedge	and my network messages seem to be mixed
2013-10-05 05:31:33	gedge	for each network, do I need to AddPort to znc, to connect differently?
2013-10-05 05:31:36	lahwran	no
2013-10-05 05:31:48	gedge	it seems to be confused (or I am)
2013-10-05 05:31:49	lahwran	you do user/network:password
2013-10-05 05:31:54	gedge	yes
2013-10-05 05:32:29	gedge	I've done 'addnetwork foo' 'jumpnetwork foo' 'addserver irc.foo 1234'
2013-10-05 05:33:23	gedge	then, in irssi, server add cname-foo -network foo znc-host 1212 user/foo:pw
2013-10-05 05:34:12	@psychon	irssi is stupid :)
2013-10-05 05:34:13	gedge	but then I ended up with multiple connections to the same network (listallusernetworks)
2013-10-05 05:34:21	@psychon	I have 5 znc networks
2013-10-05 05:34:26	gedge	and no connections to others
2013-10-05 05:34:31	@psychon	for irssi to automatically connect to them, I need three different ports
2013-10-05 05:34:37	lahwran	wat?
2013-10-05 05:34:44	gedge	thought so
2013-10-05 05:34:45	@psychon	I connect via hostname and port1, ip and port1, hostname and port2, ip and port2
2013-10-05 05:34:46	@psychon	etc
2013-10-05 05:34:48	KindOne	lahwran: I refues to run python since its a perl clone
2013-10-05 05:34:52	@psychon	just so that irssi can tell the "servers" apart
2013-10-05 05:34:59	lahwran	you're silly, KindOne 
2013-10-05 05:35:03	gedge	psychon: was thinking that
2013-10-05 05:35:07	gedge	thanks
2013-10-05 05:35:10	lahwran	wtf irssi
2013-10-05 05:35:40	@psychon	I can only add one more net before I have to ping Kuja for another port forwarding again ;)
2013-10-05 05:35:43	gedge	host:port == host:port => one_true_net
2013-10-05 05:36:16	KindOne	lahwran, im serious.
2013-10-05 05:36:21	gedge	so, pain - back to reconfiguring irssi's servers again
2013-10-05 05:36:38	lahwran	KindOne: that's an extremely immature reason for not using a language

2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[17:39:26] hey
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[17:39:31] anyone feels like writing a changelog?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	DAUK1	[18:33:43] Hi there! I'm a big ole hairy noob and need help! I was given znc by someone and I'm a bit thick, can't see how to get it connect to quakenet
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:02:27] Is it possible to change the main port ZNC uses?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:02:50] whats a "main port"?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:02:57] are you looking for /znc addport and /znc delport?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:03:48] I currently have the port set to 6667, and want to change it, but how do I remove 6667 afterwards?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:04:24] /znc delport 6667
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:04:38] Oh, it's just that it didn't look like I could do that from the WebUI >.>
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:04:51] uhm
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:04:58] from the WebUI: dunno if it is possible
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:05:09] looks like it
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:05:20] Hrm, I'll just do it that way anyways
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:16:18] Where is the file that holds the text for the main page (while logged out)?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[20:16:18] i.e. "Welcome to ZNC's web interface"
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:18:29] grep says webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.html
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:18:36] s/html/tmpl/
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[20:18:36] psychon meant: “grep says webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.tmpl”
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[20:19:03] and the above filelist says that this is installed to /usr/share/znc/webskins/_default_/tmpl/index.tmpl
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:50:21] Durrck: psychon: you can remove ports from webadmin... but you need to connect to webadmin via the other port
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[23:56:45] and ports can be added on the Settings page, too?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:56:56] added and removed
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nate	[21:49:30] Wasn't the nickserv module setup at some point to use /nickserv instead of /msg nickserv?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[21:52:12] the question suggests that "nope"
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[21:52:28] but seems like you can now change the commands it uses
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[21:52:39] /znc *nickserv viewcommands
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[21:52:42] (and of course "help")
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:52:54] yeah you can
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:53:08] although I had to change the source for it to be compatible with PTnet's services
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:53:14] uhm
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:53:17] how can I remove a listener?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:53:22] I added one now I want to remove it
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[21:53:26] /znc delport
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[21:53:29] thx
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nate	[22:01:33] psychon: Ah, I remember networks like dalnet coming up in the past, since /nickserv is near 99% of the time a supported alias ircd side I thought it was changed to it at some point
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[22:05:22] ptnet never supported /msg nickserv at all
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[22:06:01] i believe it is to prevent passwords from being logged in clients
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:48:05] -*status(znc@znc.in)-
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:48:07] can we change that mask?

2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:50:37] so editing the source only. okay, thanks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:50:46] not that it's that important. was just wondering
2013-10-06 09:57:56	bukan	[02:40:52] !request
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[02:40:52] bukan, ZNC is free software. Just install and use it. If you wanted free BNC account instead, go somewhere else. http://wiki.znc.in/Providers may be a good start.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MndrgCode	[02:55:24] Hello all.  I have a "tiered" setup (one user connects to networks, multiple users connect to that user) to share connection to various clients with different settings...i just turned off logging on the user level and network level for all my second-tier users in the web interface, but i still see it writing logs in ~/.znc/moddata/log
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MndrgCode	[02:55:46] why is that? do i have to restart znc or do s'th else to trigger the change?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MndrgCode	[02:55:53] or could it be savebuff
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MndrgCode	[02:55:54] ?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[02:58:19] .znc/moddata/log sounsd like global module data
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:04:48] SilverLeo: it's irc logs
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:05:02] (b/c i didn't specify a directory for the "log" module)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[03:06:05] yes, and since the folder is under .znc/moddata, it's loaded as a global module
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[03:07:47] .znc/moddata/users/user/moddata/log would be usermodule and .znc/moddata/users/user/networks/network/log would be from a network module
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[03:08:10] s#network/log#network/moddata/log#
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[03:08:10] SilverLeo meant: “.znc/moddata/users/user/moddata/log would be usermodule and .znc/moddata/users/user/networks/network/moddata/log would be from a network module”
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:11:28] aha!
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:12:02] i didn't even look into the primary user's settings...i'm seeing logfiles starting [znc_user]_[network]...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:12:13] so i thought it was in the individual users' settings
2013-10-06 09:57:56	mcode	[03:12:27] thanks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[03:14:19] [znc] Ditti4 opened pull request #409: Fixed the bug of the buffer count of a channel not getting saved to the config when using the webadmin. (master...master)  http://git.io/HAf8Mw
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[04:09:55] I've changed my theme to some theme I found off the Internet. The only problem with it is that it's completely broken and I can't change the theme via the webadmin anymore.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[04:10:01] Where's the raw config file for it?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Durrck	[04:16:26] Nevermind, managed to change it back with a cached version of the site
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[04:26:26] znc.conf
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Pitbull	[10:18:35] Psychon, been using znc for a few years adds I just wanted tei say thanks  for such awesome software
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[18:30:00] wasnt me, but thanks :)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[22:45:08] this might be an edge case, but anyone else have problems with fail2ban, with ZNC running behind a load balancer? (and maybe with irssi clients?)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[22:55:15] How would you load balance it?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[23:09:29] [znc] jantman opened issue #410: fail2ban log and unban  http://git.io/vbBEPQ
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:16:45] DGandalf: I *am* load balancing it
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:17:07] What do you mean by that?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:17:20] looks like the issue I'm having is with SNAT, znc sees every client as having the same IP address (that of the load balancer), and therefore messes with fail2ban
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:17:53] So you load balancing clients, not ZNC?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:17:58] DGandalf: ok sorry... I'm not load balancing between multiple ZNC instances, but I'm having my clients connect to a load balancer VIP and that forwards to ZNC
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:18:14] hum
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:18:21] so 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:18:59] what's the benefit of doing that?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:19:06] what you balance is the initial tcp handshake, right? connections don't jump between instances or anything
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:19:58] right
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:20:41] can't say there's a distinct "benefit"... but it's required for our network setup
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:21:09] so... I'm thinking about forking znc and adding logging to the fail2ban module, since there doesn't seem to be any
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:21:40] though I'm a little unsure of whether it should be internal to fail2ban (essentially reimplementing a lot of adminlog) or somehow send to adminlog
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:22:03] Commands which show current state and remove one of IPs would be nice
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:22:24] Not sure about "log"
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:22:51] what I'm running is a private server, so honestly I *want* a log of every client that's banned...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:23:05] not just for debugging purposes, but security too...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:23:30] but yeah, I'd also like admin commands... though those are way past my knowledge of c++
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:23:39] We just need better logging system
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:23:59] If to make it only for one module, it's no so useful
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:24:41] agreed
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:25:11] but I think I can probably come up with a patch that does it for fail2ban, either internally or with adminlog
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:25:18] I don't think I can do much more than that
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:27:45] so I get it
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:27:48] the ips fail2ban sees
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:27:52] are those from the lb
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:28:16] yeah
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:28:18] you need the equivalente of the X-Forwarded-For http header :p
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:28:24] *-e
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:28:26] no, I can fix that
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:28:31] in the load balancer
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:28:48] but the issue still remains that I *happen* to know that's the problem and the fix... 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:28:49] really? :o
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:29:04] but I'd really like some logs to back that up...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	nausea	[23:29:29] wait, can fail2ban see the ips that originally connected to the load balancer if it's the load balancer thats connecting to znc?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:30:35] I can make it do that...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:33:11] set the host that fail2ban is running on to use the LB as its default route, and then tell the LB to setup a SNAT pool, which will pass the original client IP...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[23:35:17] Why do you need NAT at all instead of IPv6?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jantman	[23:36:46] um... because we're on an IPv4 network, and SNAT is how F5 BigIP LTMs work...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[11:44:37] [znc] jantman opened pull request #411: Issue #410: fail2ban logging to file and/or syslog, or not at all (master...issue410_fail2ban_log)  http://git.io/Qy25PQ
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:31:35] is there anyway to reduce the delay from when znc is started, to when clients connect
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:33:19] znc has no control over clients
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:33:28] well, i mean znc -> server
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:34:03] ConnectDelay, ServerThrottle
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:34:32] yeah, i've got each set to 60 and 0
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:34:53] some servers are taking like ~20 minutes to reconnect after restarting 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:36:36] i use ConnectDelay = 1 and ServerThrottle = 60, and no identd, so each network gets connected pretty much instantly
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:37:22] so what does *status say about the network that takes 20min?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:37:23] is it trying to connect and fails or what?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:38:04] it's like the socket is idle
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:38:12] then after a while it times out
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:38:27] there's no errors though
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:39:30] which version of znc?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:39:38] just pulled the latest git
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[13:39:41] you could try running znc with --debug to see what it's doing

2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:44:08] ha, looks like it was my serverthrottle setting
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:44:32] changed it from 0 and it connects all of them straight away
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:51:59] 60/1 seem to be the perfect middleground
2013-10-06 09:57:56	jarryd	[13:52:02] thanks

2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[13:38:59] hello i just installed znc and can connect but how do i connect to a second server and channel on that server do i need to create another user name?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[13:40:16] if you have 1.0, just add another network inside the user and create another connections using username/network:password
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[13:41:05] how dfo i do this from the web interface
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[13:41:19] sorry i do not understand add another networ?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[13:41:24] sorry i do not understand add another network?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[13:42:27] much simpler via *status, /msg *status addnetwork freenode ; /server ip:port username/freenode:password ; /msg *status addserver irc.freenode.net

2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:24:17] KindOne: ZNC 0.206+deb1 - http://znc.in
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[14:24:53] Right.. Upgrade to 1.0
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[14:25:21] in 1.0, you can have multiple networks with your user
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:27:48] and in 0.206 you can add multiple users
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:30:39] i used apt-get install to install on mint/ubuintu

2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:30:47] how do i upgrade/?

2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[14:31:04] somewhere in their is some sort of backports thingy for Ubuntu
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:33:01] psychon: how do i do it with my current version?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:33:27] i have it set up and can connect to a server and channel just need to connect to a differnt server and channel too
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:33:28] /znc loadmod admin
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:33:34] /znc *admin adduser
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:33:39] do i create a new user?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:33:41] I guess the adduser command needs an argument
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:36:16] i have setup it connects to a server and no0w would like to connect it to a second server and channel too
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:36:23] is this what it is designed for?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:36:49] do i need to create a different user
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:37:37] one user has a single irc connection
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:39:31] to one server?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:41:43] to one server
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:42:38] and i can not have duplicate user names?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:42:49] no, you cant
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[14:42:56] and I dont see how that would be a problem anyway
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:43:09] so i can not connect with the same server with the same user name?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:46:06] i mean the same name on different servers?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[14:46:43] nvm i think i see
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[16:41:01] how do i stop and restasrt znc when i leave a client it disconnects from the server shouldnt znc stay logged in?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[16:51:28] anyone know how to start and stop znc?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[16:51:45] znc stop and sudo services znc stop not working
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:55:14] You could create your own init script and then be able to 'service znc stop'
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:56:12] Or, perhaps easier, you can just run znc on the command line (I believe it backgrounds itself?)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:56:27] Then find its pid and kill it when you want to stop it. I think.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[16:57:23] there is no stop command?\
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[16:57:31] used znc to start it'
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:57:47] You can stop znc from within znc
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:58:10] think it's /quote znc shutdown or /msg *znc shutdown
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[16:59:26] apparently sending SIGINT to znc causes it to shutdown in the same manner
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[17:00:36] Hm. Check [[Running ZNC as a system daemon]] perhaps (that particular script is for Debian)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[17:00:37] http://wiki.znc.in/Running_ZNC_as_a_system_daemon
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[17:01:16] i cant stop it from the command line?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[17:01:43] You can find its PID and kill -2 that pid
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[17:01:56] how?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[17:01:59] that sends a SIGINT, which works as I mentioned
2013-10-06 09:57:56	kezu_	[17:02:13] why no command to stop it?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[17:02:15] pkill -2 znc
2013-10-06 09:57:56	meingtsla	[17:02:32] that will send sigint to all znc processes

2013-10-06 09:57:56	Sickness	[03:02:20] i mean when znc connects to ssl irc server i would need accept the certificate if it's not trusted already
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Sickness	[03:02:41] if ssl certificate changes i need to accept it again or reject

2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:27:07] quick question... does znc have any modules which support emailing of highlights when the user is /away and/or disconnected?

2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:46:42] simply email.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:48:15] hm. that appears to require more work than i'm doing in my current not-znc configuration. also, can one set that to do quiet hours? i assume that's what the conditions are for?

2013-10-06 09:57:56	balrog	[06:55:48] no, I typed /znc connect by mistake :P
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:55:56] doh.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:56:23] i'm not seeing quiet hours for either of those though. :P
2013-10-06 09:57:56	balrog	[06:57:05] coding a module isn't hard; I did it in python when the pirateat40 ponzi spam took place on freenode
2013-10-06 09:57:56	balrog	[06:57:13] (not sure if you remember that whole incident)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	balrog	[06:57:16] ofc I did it in python
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:59:11] the one thing i'm really looking for from znc though that i don't have with my current solution is "connections from specific hostmasks only get a subset of the channels" and "multiple networks with one connection" would be a great bonus.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[06:59:19] i'm not seeing if that's possible or not.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[11:53:54] lewellyn: no "multiple networks with one connection". By hostmasks you mean clients?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lewellyn	[12:05:54] yes.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@DGandalf	[12:18:13] lewellyn: you can try setup similar to the one in [[FAQ]] in the bottom about separate PMs per clients, and have different set of detached channels on client users
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[12:18:13] http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ

2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[05:53:21] Can the log module be recompiled to include outgoing messages?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[05:55:37] what do you mean 'outgoing messages' ?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:00:07] It is not recording anything that I say to the log
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[06:10:34] /msg *status version 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:12:31] was that for me?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[06:13:51] Yes.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:14:07] [10/1/13 6:12 PM] <*status> ZNC 1.0+deb2ubuntu1 - http://znc.in
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:14:07] [10/1/13 6:12 PM] <*status> IPv6: yes, SSL: yes, DNS: threads
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[06:15:03] it should be logging stuff you send though znc ..
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:18:06] Strange thing is not I notice new log files with my messages. Capitalization of the channel is wrong putting it in a new file.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:18:51] Let me go back and look at this
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Meson	[06:21:04] For the record it looks like the "incoming" messages are logged under the channel with the name in all lowercase.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:00:41] quick question, why do some channels become disabled in znc after a while?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:04:14] nm, looks like the channels that become disabled are channels with keys. must be getting disconnected and reconnecting without the key, therefore znc is unable to join. anyone know how to add channel keys to channel config in znc?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	rwxr	[21:09:07] do it in webadmin
2013-10-06 09:57:56	rwxr	[21:09:16] i usually don't store keys
2013-10-06 09:57:56	rwxr	[21:09:55] after a split or disconnect i get "unable to join #chan: incorrect key"
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:10:08] i don't think i've ever used webadmin, will check it out
2013-10-06 09:57:56	rwxr	[21:10:14] just disconnect and reconnect to znc and you will rejoin chan
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:11:03] that's usually what i do, but the time between disconnects and reconnects is several days
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:11:15] and when i reconnect all channels are rejoined except those with keys
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Rinzler	[21:11:40] err, rather still joined w/ buffer playback
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:14:15] bindhost = vhost ?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:14:41] cant seem to get it working keeps just showing ipv6 ip instead of the vhost
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[00:17:46] MarkyP: did you check the [[faq]] entry on bindhosts?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[00:17:46] http://wiki.znc.in/faq
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:18:10] looking now
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:24:02] i did do setvhost but its still showing just the ipv6 address
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[00:27:16] so your host resolves to the ipv6 and the ipv6 resolves back to the host?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:28:31] ah no
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:28:40] it doesnt resolve back
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:28:49] ipv4 or v6 doh
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:28:58] its showing kimsufi domain now
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:31:35] i thought just setting the host as the ip would work how do i get it to resolve back to the host
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[00:33:51] it's a simple reverse dns entry, a PTR-record
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:07] host mark.gaf.me.uk
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:07] mark.gaf.me.uk has address 94.23.40.104
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:07] mark.gaf.me.uk has IPv6 address 2001:41d0:2:2968::1
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:26] host 94.23.40.104
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:26] 104.40.23.94.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer ks370216.kimsufi.com.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:35:39] thats not right is it, im new to this just wanted a vhost
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[00:36:42] for ipv4, that wouldn't work since mark.gaf.me.uk doesnt match ks370216.kimsufi.com.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@SilverLeo	[00:37:10] and for ipv6, 2001:41d0:2:2968::1 doesn't have a reverse at all
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:38:09] i just pointed both ips to the domain thought that would be it
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:38:40] should have looked in to it i guess 1st
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:42:13] ill let them know i want a ptr record
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[00:42:24] change w/e
2013-10-06 09:57:56	daswort	[01:57:09] hi my freenode znc instance cant connect because Error from Server [Closing Link: 2001: (Too many host connections (local))]
2013-10-06 09:57:56	daswort	[01:58:04] what can that be?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@flakes	[01:58:36] "Too many host connections" is pretty obvious, isn't it?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	daswort	[01:59:45] by znc, or by the client? flakes 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@flakes	[01:59:58] znc <-> IRC network
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@flakes	[02:00:15] assuming the message is from *status, not from your IRC client
2013-10-06 09:57:56	daswort	[02:00:59] how can that happen? i did not change the znc config and channel list since weeks.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@flakes	[02:02:48] it's usually host (IP) based, so if other people are making connections from your IP this may happen
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@flakes	[02:02:59] your ZNC server IP, that is
2013-10-06 09:57:56	daswort	[02:06:14] so i have to ask my hoster for another ip, or i have to search for all users that run irc on the ip and mail them :(
2013-10-06 09:57:56	MarkyP	[06:14:40] i got it done now, thanks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	idahodude	[13:55:36] Howdy. Is there a way I can prevent a user from being to addserver or a new network?

2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[14:01:51] addserver, nope, add a second network server, you can *
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[14:02:56] you would need to write a patch to prevent people from changing the server address.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	SourceX	[14:03:15] iirc someone already has/had one somewhere
2013-10-06 09:57:56	SourceX	[14:03:57] or maybe it wasn't fully compatible with the webui or something
2013-10-06 09:57:56	idahodude	[14:04:01] Thanks. Ill look around for it.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	ZNCLinker	[02:43:06] [znc] rakiru opened issue #413: Regex support for watch module  http://git.io/SLleFg
2013-10-06 09:57:56	acDC	[09:36:57] is there a way to delete selective messages in bulk on awaystore, but not all
2013-10-06 09:57:56	acDC	[09:37:25] as the numbers change you have to press delete 1 then show all again

2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:27:50] hi, new user to znc, struggling...
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:28:05] psychon: I refuse to click that link for moral reasons
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:28:12] running irssi, I can see nothing on the website saying how I get a /znc command
2013-10-06 09:57:56	SourceX	[05:28:23] rofl psychon
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:28:37] gedge: most irc clients will just ask the server to deal with any unknown commands
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:28:53] gedge: /quote znc
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:29:14] gedge: or just query to *status (/znc is equivalent to /msg *status, /znc *foo equivalent to /msg *foo)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:29:25] lahwran: that's ok with me :)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:29:32] makes sense, thanks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:30:32] also, I added one network at startup time (--makeconfig) but am now adding networks via /msg *status
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:30:37] wow, painful
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:30:54] and my network messages seem to be mixed
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:31:33] for each network, do I need to AddPort to znc, to connect differently?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:31:36] no
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:31:48] it seems to be confused (or I am)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:31:49] you do user/network:password
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:31:54] yes
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:32:29] I've done 'addnetwork foo' 'jumpnetwork foo' 'addserver irc.foo 1234'
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:33:23] then, in irssi, server add cname-foo -network foo znc-host 1212 user/foo:pw
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:12] irssi is stupid :)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:34:13] but then I ended up with multiple connections to the same network (listallusernetworks)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:21] I have 5 znc networks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:34:26] and no connections to others
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:31] for irssi to automatically connect to them, I need three different ports
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:34:37] wat?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:34:44] thought so
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:45] I connect via hostname and port1, ip and port1, hostname and port2, ip and port2
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:46] etc
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[05:34:48] lahwran: I refues to run python since its a perl clone
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:34:52] just so that irssi can tell the "servers" apart
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:34:59] you're silly, KindOne 
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:35:03] psychon: was thinking that
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:35:07] thanks
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:35:10] wtf irssi
2013-10-06 09:57:56	@psychon	[05:35:40] I can only add one more net before I have to ping Kuja for another port forwarding again ;)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:35:43] host:port == host:port => one_true_net
2013-10-06 09:57:56	KindOne	[05:36:16] lahwran, im serious.
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gedge	[05:36:21] so, pain - back to reconfiguring irssi's servers again
2013-10-06 09:57:56	lahwran	[05:36:38] KindOne: that's an extremely immature reason for not using a language
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Roze	[06:42:35] Hi, I has recently started using ZNC for personal use and is wondering if there is any way to enable buffer for queries too, not just channels
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Roze	[06:45:47] I couldn't find any good information about this on google
2013-10-06 09:57:56	tomaw	[07:03:41] does http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#How_to_store_private_messages_even_when_user_is_attached.2C_so_other_clients_can_see_them.3F solve your problem?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	tomaw	[07:03:59] what a pretty url
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Roze	[08:54:14] tomaw: seems like a solution for now, even if I think its a bad way of doing it, ty anyway :)
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Zeraphine	[11:13:16] hola?
2013-10-06 09:57:56	Gryllida	[11:13:34] hi

2013-10-06 11:14:17	blarg422	i can't connect even by using my machine's external ip though
2013-10-06 11:16:11	KindOne	wrong port?
2013-10-06 11:17:21	blarg422	i don't think so because i'm specifying the port i set in the config
2013-10-06 11:17:38	blarg422	also i get Connection timed out if i use the port i specified, whereas i get Connection refused if i use a diff port

2013-10-06 17:23:20	jPi	well its the first time ive set znc on diff shell
2013-10-06 17:23:23	jPi	it started then
2013-10-06 17:23:39	jPi	now that i check the channel, there was quite a big chatter, i got buffer set to 200lines
2013-10-06 17:23:53	jPi	and out of those '200' it replied my like 40
2013-10-06 17:24:02	jPi	all other ppl lines were not displayed at all
2013-10-06 17:24:12	@DGandalf	What's the difference from old znc?
2013-10-06 17:24:17	jPi	timeframe was like from 8am till say 18pm
2013-10-06 17:24:26	jPi	dont think there is any besides shell
2013-10-06 17:24:31	jPi	1.0
2013-10-06 17:24:38	jPi	buffers on, autoclearbuffer
2013-10-06 17:24:47	jPi	nothing that id recall, that ive made different way
2013-10-06 17:26:01	@DGandalf	Run znc -D, and show what happens when someone says something, and what happens when you connect after that and read the buffer
2013-10-06 17:26:38	@DGandalf	Btw, you shouldn'd see your messages at all, if you had autoclearbuffer on...
2013-10-06 17:26:55	jPi	hehe yea i reckon that aswell
2013-10-06 17:26:59	jPi	will do
2013-10-06 17:27:03	@DGandalf	Only what happened since your disconnect
2013-10-06 17:27:37	jPi	that znc -D i need to reboot my current znc and run it with that, or just this, as a secondary debug or smth
2013-10-06 17:29:00	jPi	k nvm ;) reboot meh thanks will report back

2013-10-06 21:12:58	@psychon	uhm? from your client or from znc?
2013-10-06 21:13:04	@psychon	try /msg *nickserv set my-password
2013-10-06 21:13:14	@psychon	or /quote privmsg *nickserv set my-password
2013-10-06 21:13:36	suukiop	I don't understand irc very much, sorry
2013-10-06 21:14:44	suukiop	Ok, it said password set.
2013-10-06 21:16:19	suukiop	And now to join the room, I need to type "/MSG bot enter <key>". Then im invited into the rooms
2013-10-06 21:16:31	suukiop	Is there a way to do this automatically through znc too?
2013-10-06 21:19:02	@psychon	/znc *status loadmod perform
2013-10-06 21:19:45	@psychon	then you can add commands like this: /znc *perform /msg bot enter key
2013-10-06 21:20:47	suukiop	It says "unknown command"
2013-10-06 21:20:57	suukiop	*perform said that's
2013-10-06 21:21:48	suukiop	I have the web module, maybe it's easier?
2013-10-06 21:22:08	suukiop	As this isn't working for me
2013-10-06 21:23:18	@psychon	oh, sorry
2013-10-06 21:23:21	@psychon	then you can add commands like this: /znc *perform add /msg bot enter key
2013-10-06 21:24:29	suukiop	Great, added
2013-10-06 21:25:30	suukiop	Now I need to do a similar thing in my irssi client. But I get "unknown command /znc"
2013-10-06 21:25:51	@psychon	use "/quote znc" instead of "/znc"

2013-10-06 21:31:27	TheLastPr	Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone knew of a reliable way to connect to some servers through Tor but not all when using ZNC. I'm running ZNC 1.0-5+b1 on Debian Testing. I've read around the web and the only recommendation I find is using socat, but that seems to be really hit-and-miss on my system (have to be lucky whenever I boot it up) so I was wondering if anyone knew a better way

2013-10-06 21:35:01	@SilverLeo	i don't think you can easily have both in one znc without some firewall/nat trickery. so maybe you could run two zncs with one over torify or something
2013-10-06 21:35:23	TheLastPr	That... is actually one of the better suggestions I've heard in a while
2013-10-06 21:35:29	TheLastPr	Can't believe I didn't think of that
2013-10-06 21:36:28	TheLastPr	I guess I'll just torify a second instance with a different datadir, hmm

2013-10-06 21:52:28	suukiop	I have set up two IRC server in ZNC. Is it possible to connect to both from the same client? I am connected to one, but can't connect to the other.
2013-10-06 21:53:00	suukiop	I tried /server 127.0.0.1 <user:pass>
2013-10-06 21:53:14	suukiop	It won't connect because im already connected to 127.0.0.1 
2013-10-06 21:53:27	suukiop	(under a different user:pass
2013-10-06 21:53:57	TheLastPr	suukiop: You may want to tell your client to use "localhost"
2013-10-06 21:54:07	TheLastPr	Some clients complain when you connect to the same server more than once
2013-10-06 21:54:15	TheLastPr	And localhost and 127.0.0.1 should be the same
2013-10-06 21:54:26	TheLastPr	::1 should also be possible, if you're feeling IPv6-ish
2013-10-06 21:54:54	suukiop	Hey thanks that worked :D
2013-10-06 21:55:39	suukiop	But what the hell would I do if I wanted to connect to 10 different networks?
2013-10-06 21:56:42	TheLastPr	You could mess with your system hostfiles, or perhaps consider switching IRC client. Weechat only complains about this when you want to connect to the same port on the same network more than once, and multiple ZNC instances should be on different ports, so it shouldn't be an issue for WeeChat
2013-10-06 21:57:05	TheLastPr	Although WeeChat isn't the easiest client to start off with :P

2013-10-06 22:01:55	@psychon	znc version?
2013-10-06 22:02:07	@psychon	oh, 1.0, you already said so
2013-10-06 22:02:12	@psychon	then I dont know either
2013-10-06 22:02:35	TheLastPr	Well, some site says you need to map the address to an IP in the Tor config files, guess I'll try that
2013-10-06 22:09:27	TheLastPr	Interesting, that causes "Cannot connect to IRC (Resource temporarily unavailable). Retrying..." errors from *status
2013-10-06 22:09:30	TheLastPr	The plot thickens
2013-10-06 22:11:18	MarkyP_	it tells you in the web admin page how to connect
2013-10-06 22:11:50	TheLastPr	I have set all of that up, this is combining-Tor-with-ZNC issues
2013-10-06 22:11:54	MarkyP_	after adding the new network for me : MarkyP/efnetgaf:<password>
2013-10-06 22:12:22	MarkyP_	or MarkyP/fnodegaf:<password>
2013-10-06 22:12:28	TheLastPr	I know, I know

2013-10-06 22:14:53	MarkyP_	for freenode for me
2013-10-06 22:15:02	suukiop	What is MarkyP/fnodegaf?

2013-10-06 22:15:18	MarkyP_	MArkyP is my znc username
2013-10-06 22:15:31	MarkyP_	the fnodegaf is what i named freenode in znc
2013-10-06 22:17:29	MarkyP_	in the webadmin it tells you if you go to Your Settings
2013-10-06 22:17:39	MarkyP_	then click edit on any of the servers you have added
2013-10-06 22:17:44	MarkyP_	and it tells you right at the top
2013-10-06 22:17:56	MarkyP_	To connect to this network from your IRC client, you can set the server password field as follows: MarkyP/efnetgaf:<password> or username field as MarkyP/efnetgaf
2013-10-06 22:21:53	TheLastPr	psychon: Would you have had a clue what to do on another version or were you trying to recommend me to update if my version would be too old?
2013-10-06 22:22:25	@psychon	TheLastPr: the later, znc before 1.0 does DNS directly (through libc-ares) instead of using the system resolver, thus that couldnt possibly work

2013-10-06 22:22:48	TheLastPr	Well, thanks for the attempt, at least
2013-10-06 22:23:52	suukiop	Where do I type that, MarkyP_ ?
2013-10-06 22:24:27	MarkyP_	well im not sure on your client im using mirc and just put it in the password field
2013-10-06 22:25:19	suukiop	Ah i see, Im using chatzilla, it doesn't seem to have a password field
2013-10-06 22:25:47	MarkyP_	when you connect to the server dont you have to do a /quote user/pass or some shit?
2013-10-06 22:27:17	suukiop	I do: /server localhost user:pass 
2013-10-06 22:29:07	MarkyP_	yeah so that that instead
2013-10-06 22:30:15	MarkyP_	/server localhost user/servername:pass
2013-10-06 22:30:54	suukiop	What is the server name?
2013-10-06 22:31:06	MarkyP_	what ever you named it in znx
2013-10-06 22:31:08	MarkyP_	znc
2013-10-06 22:31:12	MarkyP_	when setting it up
2013-10-06 22:33:33	MarkyP_	yeah you get there yet? lol
2013-10-06 22:33:51	MarkyP_	check in ur wedadmin if you dont know what you named them

2013-10-07 22:04:07	Hexan	I was trying to order an pizza from www.just-eat.dk and i came across this pizza with nutella! eww http://www.hexan.dk/files/viewing/pizza_with_nutella.jpg/
2013-10-07 22:04:59	candise	Hi. I am having a problem with 'perform'. I set up ZNC to automatically send a command when connecting to an IRC server. However, the command was not sent when I was disconnect/reconnected to the server.
2013-10-07 22:05:03	candise	So in the middle of the night I was disconnected/reconnected and ZNC did not send the command. I had to manually send the command after waking up.
2013-10-07 22:05:32	candise	Is ZNC supposed to send the command when it reconnects to an IRC server?

2013-10-07 22:52:55	candise	it shows the two commands: " | 1 | PRIVMSG CableGuy :IDENTIFY <user> <password> "
2013-10-07 22:53:19	candise	and the other one below it

2013-10-07 23:00:29	candise	should i do a test by restarting znc and seeing if it correctly joins the server?
2013-10-07 23:01:05	candise	im not sure if there is a way to make ZNC disconnect from a specific server?
2013-10-07 23:01:39	KindOne	id load the RAW module and reconnect to see what happens, /msg *status loadmod raw ; /msg *status jump
2013-10-07 23:03:51	candise	it worked fine...
2013-10-07 23:04:10	candise	maybe because i deleted and readded the commands. its possible i made a mistake the first time or something...
2013-10-07 23:04:25	candise	is it normal that i can see people's private messages in Raw mode?
2013-10-07 23:05:50	KindOne	technically channel/PMs are PRIVMSG's

2013-10-08 11:22:31	dexter0	Hello, I'm working on a znc user module and having trouble with PutModule().  As I understand this function is supposed to send a direct message to the user who owns the module instance.  Yet in my test setup, I don't receive any message when I call PutModule in the OnLoad callback.

2013-10-08 11:47:56	Aracat	anything to paste? there's not a lot to work with so far
2013-10-08 11:50:59	dexter0	Yes, http://pastebin.com/JYYduR6w
2013-10-08 11:51:03	KindOne	dexter0, look at this? (if you have not seen it) http://people.znc.in/~psychon/znc/doc/
2013-10-08 11:53:03	dexter0	Thanks KindOne, that was the first place I looked.
2013-10-08 12:06:23	@DGandalf	dexter0: you don't have PutModule there...
2013-10-08 12:07:30	@DGandalf	Ah, see it now
2013-10-08 12:07:39	@DGandalf	So, what is NSLog?
2013-10-08 12:08:24	dexter0	I'm using ObjectiveC++, it's the ObjC equivalent of printf
2013-10-08 12:09:08	@DGandalf	Is it compatible with C++?
2013-10-08 12:09:30	dexter0	yes,it's a superset
2013-10-08 12:10:59	dexter0	of c++
2013-10-08 12:11:42	@DGandalf	How it's compiled?
2013-10-08 12:12:11	@DGandalf	And is it binary compatible with C++?
2013-10-08 12:13:59	dexter0	it's compiled with g++ and is binary compatible with regular c++ code (or as binary compatible as you can get with c++ code)
2013-10-08 12:14:43	dexter0	but since you are asking me these questions, let me start from square 1 and build a module as instructed by the wiki and see if I still encounter problems.
2013-10-08 12:16:20	@DGandalf	Btw, you're loading the module from *status/webadmin, or on ZNC startup?
2013-10-08 12:16:35	dexter0	*status
2013-10-08 12:16:42	dexter0	for now
2013-10-08 12:22:15	dexter0	Ok, still experiencing the problem after converting to pure c++ and compiling with gmake <http://pastebin.com/MyFrwDuu>
2013-10-08 12:23:32	@DGandalf	Do you see "module irc2glass loaded" in status?
2013-10-08 12:23:58	dexter0	yes, 'Loaded module [irc2glass] '
2013-10-08 12:24:26	@DGandalf	run znc -D
2013-10-08 12:24:35	@DGandalf	See what happens when you load it
2013-10-08 12:31:24	dexter0	Interesting, the message is never sent.
2013-10-08 12:32:06	@DGandalf	hm
2013-10-08 12:34:09	dexter0	output immediately after loading: http://pastebin.com/zvQi5TfK
2013-10-08 12:51:17	@DGandalf	dexter0: uhm, looks like a bug
2013-10-08 12:51:35	@DGandalf	For user modules OnLoad() can't put anything to client
2013-10-08 12:53:03	@DGandalf	If I'm reading the code correctly
2013-10-08 12:54:29	dexter0	DGandalf: interesting, the auto attach module does it, but only it is encounters an error during load.  So perhaps that was never tested.
2013-10-08 12:54:47	dexter0	if it encounters*
2013-10-08 12:58:44	@DGandalf	At that moment module's m_pNetwork is not set, because it's user module and OnLoad differs a bit from other callbacks, for that case PutModule() tells CUser to send the message to all its clients, but this client is not in the list of clients, because this client is attached to some network
2013-10-08 13:00:48	@DGandalf	Why do you need user module instead of network module anyway?
2013-10-08 13:01:12	@DGandalf	Though this still needs to be fixed..
2013-10-08 13:04:02	dexter0	Network modules are more specific right?  As in a user can be connected to multiple networks so their can be multiple instances of a network module per user?
2013-10-08 13:05:14	@DGandalf	yes, once for each network of the user
2013-10-08 13:05:19	@DGandalf	or less
2013-10-08 13:05:25	@DGandalf	if not every network has it loaded
2013-10-08 13:07:09	dexter0	right.  The purpose of the module is to forward certain irc events to Google Glass.  To do that, the module needs to keep track of an access token to the Google APIs of which there should only be one per user, hence the use module.
2013-10-08 13:08:07	@DGandalf	Several instances of the module can't use the same token?
2013-10-08 13:08:09	dexter0	I don't need to call PutModule in OnLoad, originally I was calling it after receiving a code from the GoogleAPIs which the user needed to enter to grant the module access but that was failing too.
2013-10-08 13:09:01	@DGandalf	Looks like your code simplified a lot since that :P
2013-10-08 13:10:12	@DGandalf	Actually, from socket callback we have the same situation
2013-10-08 13:10:23	@DGandalf	m_pNetwork is not set either
2013-10-08 13:10:35	dexter0	right, I had setup a timer and a message queue
2013-10-08 13:11:09	@DGandalf	Uh, where else besides OnLoad and sockets/timers do you have PutModule() not working? :(
2013-10-08 13:12:16	dexter0	right now, just onLoad and timer callbacks is all I've found :P
2013-10-08 13:13:07	dexter0	so you're implying I would not have these problems if I switched to a network module?
2013-10-08 13:13:26	@DGandalf	Yes
2013-10-08 13:14:10	@DGandalf	Also it gives you an option to send messages to your glass only for some networks, and not for the others
2013-10-08 13:14:20	dexter0	alright, how would I manage associating data per user from within a network module?  I only need an OAuth refresh token to persist.
2013-10-08 13:16:09	@DGandalf	Can they use independend refresh tokens?
2013-10-08 13:16:24	@DGandalf	With one access token
2013-10-08 13:16:37	 *	DGandalf doesn't know much about OAuth yet
2013-10-08 13:16:59	dexter0	user convenience really.
2013-10-08 13:17:21	@DGandalf	Well... Fix ZNC then
2013-10-08 13:17:31	@DGandalf	And send a patch :P

2013-10-09 00:35:09	Diam0nd	Yo guys, question. My znc stopped connecing to LinkNet and has been giving out "Disconnected from IRC (Broken pipe). Reconnecting..." for weeks already
2013-10-09 00:35:17	Diam0nd	Is there any way to fix this somehow?
2013-10-09 00:35:53	@SilverLeo	sounds like you need to buy znc a new pipe
2013-10-09 00:36:07	Diam0nd	as a server i have eu.link-net.org +7000 listed, meaning its NOT a one single server
2013-10-09 00:36:36	@SilverLeo	znc version?
2013-10-09 00:36:55	Diam0nd	ZNC 1.1-nightly-20130512-588e478f
2013-10-09 00:37:53	@SilverLeo	do you have a bindhost set?
2013-10-09 00:38:44	Diam0nd	Yessir, and im sure its correct, because i have the same bindhost for 5 other networks added under the same znc
2013-10-09 00:38:50	Diam0nd	and those 5 other networks DO work
2013-10-09 00:39:04	Diam0nd	werid :?
2013-10-09 00:39:30	@SilverLeo	try adding a server by ip instead of host, also you can try clearing the bindhost or setting it to 0.0.0.0
2013-10-09 00:39:57	Diam0nd	bindhost is added by ip already
2013-10-09 00:40:14	Diam0nd	but is there maybe a command to reload or restart that one network/user thats having issues?
2013-10-09 00:41:55	@SilverLeo	/znc saveconfig and rehash would reload the conf, other than that you can only restart the whole znc process
2013-10-09 00:42:34	Diam0nd	aha...
2013-10-09 00:42:43	Diam0nd	so, i just changed the bind to 0s
2013-10-09 00:42:47	Diam0nd	and the message becase Cannot connect to IRC (Permission denied). Retrying...
2013-10-09 00:43:49	Diam0nd	added the old bind again
2013-10-09 00:43:59	Diam0nd	and again it became "Disconnected from IRC (Broken pipe). Reconnecting..."
2013-10-09 00:44:01	Diam0nd	crap
2013-10-09 00:44:15	Diam0nd	i mean, guys, i wish the EM were a little bit more informative :(
2013-10-09 00:44:21	Diam0nd	hmm......
2013-10-09 00:45:42	@SilverLeo	is it your own server or a shell? does it have some limits for connections?
2013-10-09 00:46:01	Diam0nd	shell, connections - no
2013-10-09 00:46:10	Diam0nd	the thing is that its been up for months
2013-10-09 00:46:29	Diam0nd	and only around 2 weeks ago this whole thing with ONLY this one network started
2013-10-09 00:46:39	Diam0nd	i had this broken pipe thing before
2013-10-09 00:46:45	Diam0nd	but it never lasted for weeks
2013-10-09 00:47:15	Diam0nd	hmmm
2013-10-09 00:47:24	Diam0nd	i ll try changing the bind to something else maybe
2013-10-09 00:47:31	 *	Diam0nd is looking at vhosts list
2013-10-09 00:50:10	Diam0nd	changed bind
2013-10-09 00:50:16	Diam0nd	and again the same broken pipe thing
2013-10-09 00:50:18	Diam0nd	goddamn...
2013-10-09 00:50:50	Diam0nd	any other ideas? anyone? :(
2013-10-09 00:52:38	Diam0nd	mirc crashed, im back, sorry. any1 said anything?
2013-10-09 00:52:56	@SilverLeo	did you try the linknet connection with something else? like irssi from the server or something?
2013-10-09 00:53:37	Diam0nd	irssi?
2013-10-09 00:54:08	@SilverLeo	it's an irc client usually installed on shells
2013-10-09 00:55:39	Diam0nd	aha
2013-10-09 00:55:52	Diam0nd	never heard, but i ll have a look into it, thanks!!
2013-10-09 00:56:12	Diam0nd	is there a way to restart z from the web admin?
2013-10-09 00:56:24	Diam0nd	im thinking maybe restart the whole thing first..
2013-10-09 00:56:37	@SilverLeo	not from the webadmin, but you can msg *status for it
2013-10-09 00:56:42	Diam0nd	aha!

2013-10-09 01:15:39	Diam0nd	id like to jump to 1.2
2013-10-09 01:19:47	nate	same way you would update any other version, make sure to read the changelog for any conf changes
2013-10-09 01:19:57	nate	not sure I'd want to use a beta version though for general use
2013-10-09 01:25:45	Diam0nd	well, regarding betas, ive been using nightlies like, forver. never had any issues
2013-10-09 01:27:35	Diam0nd	<nate> same way you would update any other version
2013-10-09 01:27:37	Diam0nd	:|
2013-10-09 01:27:46	Diam0nd	yeah, i asked the question to get exactly that kinda answer)))
2013-10-09 01:29:12	nate	You're looking to use a beta version but you want people to step by step you through exactly how to upgrade to it?
2013-10-09 01:29:35	 *	nate personally is of a belief if you're going to use a beta software then you should have at least the competency to actually look into how to run it yourself
2013-10-09 01:30:11	nate	The fact still stands though, changelog would cover any actual configuration changes I imagine you would need to know, and otherwise the install file would note any installation differences over 1.0

2013-10-09 01:31:30	Diam0nd	No, i thought there's either a simple way (e.g. stop the process, update files over a command or ftp), or a guide on updating (e.g. on wiki).
2013-10-09 01:32:00	Diam0nd	No offence, but if you dont have an answer to a question, why bother saying anything?
2013-10-09 01:32:10	Diam0nd	Just good old common sense.
2013-10-09 01:34:04	nate	o.O Because I had assumed, seeing as you apparently were already running ZNC, that you probably had at least a basic understanding of linux and updating binaries on it, which lead me to assume you were asking on updating configuration/compilation level stuff
2013-10-09 01:34:27	nate	(This being my own opinion of common sense that someone should probably understand the basics of their operating platform if they're compiling stuff anyways :P)
2013-10-09 01:34:28	Diam0nd	Nosir
2013-10-09 01:34:47	Diam0nd	I don't see how being able to install znc OR running a beta is a testament to that kinda logic.
2013-10-09 01:35:01	Diam0nd	I mean, install znc is not that hard and does NOT require much knowledge
2013-10-09 01:35:13	Diam0nd	other than being able to connect to a shell and run a few commands
2013-10-09 01:35:25	nate	which was kinda the point, lol
2013-10-09 01:35:49	nate	But in that case, general note of software on *nix; You can pretty much [re]compile on *nix while a process is still running
2013-10-09 01:35:51	--	gedge_ is now known as Gedge
2013-10-09 01:35:56	nate	then just 'restart' it to use the new version
2013-10-09 01:36:23	nate	so basically leave ZNC run, compile the new one the same way/path you compiled 1.0, then restart ZNC after make (install), etc

2013-10-09 02:03:50	nate	I wasn't trying to come off too dickish originally, really
2013-10-09 02:04:01	nate	and well, all the 'important' files will replace themselves automatically
2013-10-09 02:04:25	nate	That's why I said all you really gotta do is compile -> make -> make install
2013-10-09 02:04:33	nate	then restart ZNC
2013-10-09 02:05:12	nate	Most of it is pretty straight forward, but that's why I originally mentioned about checking the 1.2 changelog for any configuration file changes, if there were changes made in 1.2 that your 1.0 conf design isn't compatible with then ZNC won't start
2013-10-09 02:05:23	 *	nate still uses 1.0 though so has no idea if there were or were not conf changes in 1.2
2013-10-09 02:08:54	Diam0nd	nah, but i mean, replace themselves from where?
2013-10-09 02:09:02	Diam0nd	i thought i do the replacing first manually somehow
2013-10-09 02:09:09	Diam0nd	and them comple make and make install
2013-10-09 02:09:29	nate	Shouldn't, you just unpack the tarball and do what the install guide says

2013-10-11 02:34:25	@psychon	well, tell us more about the channel
2013-10-11 02:34:36	@psychon	what does /znc listchan say about them in the "State" column?
2013-10-11 02:34:49	@psychon	*listchans
2013-10-11 02:34:54	sWahili	Hmm i've already cleared the list
2013-10-11 02:35:02	@psychon	then I don't know :p
2013-10-11 02:35:03	sWahili	Well its not the channel, its all che channels
2013-10-11 02:35:06	sWahili	the*
2013-10-11 02:35:32	@psychon	just parting a channel should delete it from znc
2013-10-11 02:35:43	sWahili	Hehe that doesn't happen
2013-10-11 02:35:53	sWahili	Thats what baffeling me 
2013-10-11 02:36:54	sWahili	Didn't know there was an efnet channel :)
2013-10-11 02:36:56	@psychon	well: when your client sends a /part for a channel that wasnt joined, znc deletes the channel
2013-10-11 02:37:01	@psychon	else it will just forward the part
2013-10-11 02:37:26	@psychon	when the PART comes back from the irc server, znc should then delete the channel
2013-10-11 02:38:15	sWahili	Yeah it has to do with disconnect, when I disconnect from the server the channels remain
2013-10-11 02:39:53	sWahili	Another thing that has been bothering me is when i click on del for a channel I go back to the user page :/ Whats up with that?
2013-10-11 02:40:00	sWahili	(sorry to barge in and complain :P )
2013-10-11 02:42:23	@psychon	uhm, which one is "the server"? disconnect from znc or make disconenct from the irc server?
2013-10-11 02:43:38	sWahili	the irc server
2013-10-11 02:47:25	@psychon	uhm, yeah, why should that delete any channels?
2013-10-11 02:47:36	@psychon	znc will try to rejoin channels
2013-10-11 02:49:36	sWahili	Yeah but that doesn't work when channels are +i
2013-10-11 02:49:49	@psychon	true
2013-10-11 02:49:59	@psychon	set JoinTries to some non-zero value and znc will give up after that many attempts

2013-10-12 00:43:32	@SilverLeo	autoop is designed to work between two znc instances, but you're generating the response manually?
2013-10-12 00:44:19	infernion	no no, it's generated automaticaly, when the other users joins the channels specified in the *autoop

2013-10-12 21:47:55	Jinux	Hi
2013-10-12 21:48:04	KindOne	mmm?
2013-10-12 21:48:12	Jinux	I have znc bouncer set up
2013-10-12 21:48:22	Jinux	and I noticed if I connect to one network form one machine
2013-10-12 21:48:25	Jinux	and then another
2013-10-12 21:48:42	Jinux	both connections are live and work just fine, appearing as one user to the irc channel
2013-10-12 21:49:25	Jinux	Don't have a problem with that, but I was looking for a way to configure it so that some users could boot their other znc connection when they connect from another machine/client
2013-10-12 21:49:39	Jinux	Does anyone know a module for that? Or how to go about it?
2013-10-12 21:50:13	KindOne	I don't know of any module that can do that
2013-10-12 21:50:35	Jinux	Fair enough
2013-10-12 21:50:40	Jinux	Guess I'll have to write one :D
2013-10-12 21:52:19	Milliways	dont you just set up another account for that?
2013-10-12 21:53:06	@SilverLeo	Jinux: do you mean you want to kick the older client away when you connect from another machine? you can do that by setting multiclients to false for the user
2013-10-12 21:53:23	KindOne	oh wait, I forgot about that
2013-10-12 21:53:28	Jinux	Ah
2013-10-12 21:53:40	Jinux	I was wondering if there wass a config for it already, but didn't spot anything
2013-10-12 21:53:45	Jinux	lemme go check
2013-10-12 21:54:24	Jinux	ah I see
2013-10-12 21:54:32	Jinux	it's a tick box, not a configurable limit
2013-10-12 21:57:02	Jinux	That's that solved
2013-10-12 21:57:03	Jinux	cheers :)

2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:14:32] well im using mirc and in the password field you put that in
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:14:43] 'MarkyP/fnodegaf:<password>'and it connects to that server
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:14:53] for freenode for me
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:15:02] What is MarkyP/fnodegaf?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:15:07] the fnodegaf part is just what ever you named that server in znc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:15:18] MArkyP is my znc username
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:15:31] the fnodegaf is what i named freenode in znc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:17:29] in the webadmin it tells you if you go to Your Settings
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:17:39] then click edit on any of the servers you have added
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:17:44] and it tells you right at the top
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:17:56] To connect to this network from your IRC client, you can set the server password field as follows: MarkyP/efnetgaf:<password> or username field as MarkyP/efnetgaf
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:21:53] psychon: Would you have had a clue what to do on another version or were you trying to recommend me to update if my version would be too old?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[22:22:25] TheLastPr: the later, znc before 1.0 does DNS directly (through libc-ares) instead of using the system resolver, thus that couldnt possibly work
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	TheLastPr [22:22:38] nods
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:22:48] Well, thanks for the attempt, at least
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:23:52] Where do I type that, MarkyP_ ?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:24:27] well im not sure on your client im using mirc and just put it in the password field
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:25:19] Ah i see, Im using chatzilla, it doesn't seem to have a password field
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:25:47] when you connect to the server dont you have to do a /quote user/pass or some shit?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:27:17] I do: /server localhost user:pass 
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:29:07] yeah so that that instead
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:30:15] /server localhost user/servername:pass
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:30:54] What is the server name?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:31:06] what ever you named it in znx
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:31:08] znc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:31:12] when setting it up
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:33:33] yeah you get there yet? lol
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:33:51] check in ur wedadmin if you dont know what you named them
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:42:42] "Bad File decriptor"
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:42:50] I think I've gone through the list of ZNC error messages by now

2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:43:13] Nope, I don't see a "server name" in web admins
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:43:16] This is what seems to be screwing up my Tor-through-ZNC thing
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:45:36] Are you sure there is such a thing, MarkyP_ ?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:45:53] go in wed admin login

2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:46:09] then there will be your servers and what you named each one
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:47:56] It seems we have a different web interfaces
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:48:17] As there's no named
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:48:26] must have then
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:48:28] im looking at mine now
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:51:23] https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39692180/servers.png
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:51:59] Instead of "name" it says "username" on mines
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	TheLastPr [22:52:54] sighs
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:53:17] Seems to be pretty impossible to get ZNC and Tor to play nice, especially if the server to connect to requires a .onion domain .-.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:55:19] dunno then suukiop cause i havnt got a clue, i can just about do basic shit lol
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:55:35] Hmmm
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[22:55:56] i need a tutorial to do even the basic stuff
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[22:56:14] TheLastPr: so what's that local address it's trying to use?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:56:56] SilverLeo: I've tried 10.99.99.90, freenodetor and iwanttousefreenodethroughtor.com. Torify disallows 10.99.99.90 and the other two just don't resolve at all
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:59:43] Although honestly, I just give up :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[22:59:45] And now I cannot connect normally v_v
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[22:59:58] Especially because it increases my attack surface it's really not worth the trouble
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:02:26] When I try to connect to znc I get "please try again later - reconnecting too fast"
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:03:22] Znc is listening on all ip's. Im connecting using /server localhost user:passé
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:03:30] It was working fine a few minutes atop
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[23:04:47] suukiop: sounds like you hit the fail2ban module limit
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:05:28] You are right, I disabled it and now it's fined
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:05:51] Why is my iPad changing the last word of every sentence!?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	TheLastPr	[23:06:07] Because you're probably using "autocorrect"
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:06:27] :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:06:52] Does fail2ban protect my webadmin login page?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[23:09:22] lol
2013-10-15 11:12:49	MarkyP_	[23:09:50] i dont know what fail2ban is, i dont use it
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:10:15] Im wondering if there's any protection against brute force on the webadmin logins
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[23:13:37] It works for both web and irc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:13:42] Greats
2013-10-15 11:12:49	suukiop	[23:14:02] Why would autocorrect change "great" to "greats" !?!?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[23:15:15] Because your iPad sucks? :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Karv	[00:45:07] iPad ALWAYS sucks
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Hexan	[22:04:07] I was trying to order an pizza from www.just-eat.dk and i came across this pizza with nutella! eww http://www.hexan.dk/files/viewing/pizza_with_nutella.jpg/
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:04:59] Hi. I am having a problem with 'perform'. I set up ZNC to automatically send a command when connecting to an IRC server. However, the command was not sent when I was disconnect/reconnected to the server.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:05:03] So in the middle of the night I was disconnected/reconnected and ZNC did not send the command. I had to manually send the command after waking up.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:05:32] Is ZNC supposed to send the command when it reconnects to an IRC server?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[22:51:30] candise: /msg *perform list 
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[22:51:50] what is the commandd?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:52:55] it shows the two commands: " | 1 | PRIVMSG CableGuy :IDENTIFY <user> <password> "
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:53:19] and the other one below it
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:54:00] when it disconnected in the night it shows:
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:54:39] *status>	Disconnected from IRC. Reconnecting...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:54:56] <*status>	Attempting to connect to [<irc server> 6667]

2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:55:11] <*status>	The channel #btn-announce could not be joined, disabling it.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:55:56] shouldnt it send the perform command when it connected? that command should load the channel
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[22:57:50] /msg *status version 
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[22:59:35] <*status>	ZNC 0.206r2-Win-x64 - http://znc.in
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:00:11] <*status>	IPv6: yes, SSL: yes, c-ares: yes
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[23:00:11] mmm command looks correct
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:00:29] should i do a test by restarting znc and seeing if it correctly joins the server?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:01:05] im not sure if there is a way to make ZNC disconnect from a specific server?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[23:01:39] id load the RAW module and reconnect to see what happens, /msg *status loadmod raw ; /msg *status jump
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:03:51] it worked fine...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:04:10] maybe because i deleted and readded the commands. its possible i made a mistake the first time or something...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:04:25] is it normal that i can see people's private messages in Raw mode?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[23:05:50] technically channel/PMs are PRIVMSG's
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:06:01] ah i see
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:06:08] well, thanks for your help
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[23:06:32] unload it, /msg *status unloadmod raw ; and maybe you had a typo or something in the username/password
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:08:58] yeah!

2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[11:22:31] Hello, I'm working on a znc user module and having trouble with PutModule().  As I understand this function is supposed to send a direct message to the user who owns the module instance.  Yet in my test setup, I don't receive any message when I call PutModule in the OnLoad callback.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Aracat	[11:47:56] anything to paste? there's not a lot to work with so far
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[11:50:59] Yes, http://pastebin.com/JYYduR6w
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[11:51:03] dexter0, look at this? (if you have not seen it) http://people.znc.in/~psychon/znc/doc/
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[11:53:03] Thanks KindOne, that was the first place I looked.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:06:23] dexter0: you don't have PutModule there...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:07:30] Ah, see it now
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:07:39] So, what is NSLog?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:08:24] I'm using ObjectiveC++, it's the ObjC equivalent of printf
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:09:08] Is it compatible with C++?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:09:30] yes,it's a superset
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:10:59] of c++
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:11:42] How it's compiled?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:12:11] And is it binary compatible with C++?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:13:59] it's compiled with g++ and is binary compatible with regular c++ code (or as binary compatible as you can get with c++ code)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:14:43] but since you are asking me these questions, let me start from square 1 and build a module as instructed by the wiki and see if I still encounter problems.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:16:20] Btw, you're loading the module from *status/webadmin, or on ZNC startup?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:16:35] *status
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:16:42] for now
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:22:15] Ok, still experiencing the problem after converting to pure c++ and compiling with gmake <http://pastebin.com/MyFrwDuu>
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:23:32] Do you see "module irc2glass loaded" in status?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:23:58] yes, 'Loaded module [irc2glass] '
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:24:26] run znc -D
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:24:35] See what happens when you load it
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:31:24] Interesting, the message is never sent.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:32:06] hm
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:34:09] output immediately after loading: http://pastebin.com/zvQi5TfK
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:51:17] dexter0: uhm, looks like a bug
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:51:35] For user modules OnLoad() can't put anything to client
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:53:03] If I'm reading the code correctly
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:54:29] DGandalf: interesting, the auto attach module does it, but only it is encounters an error during load.  So perhaps that was never tested.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[12:54:47] if it encounters*
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[12:58:44] At that moment module's m_pNetwork is not set, because it's user module and OnLoad differs a bit from other callbacks, for that case PutModule() tells CUser to send the message to all its clients, but this client is not in the list of clients, because this client is attached to some network
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:00:48] Why do you need user module instead of network module anyway?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:01:12] Though this still needs to be fixed..
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:04:02] Network modules are more specific right?  As in a user can be connected to multiple networks so their can be multiple instances of a network module per user?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:05:14] yes, once for each network of the user
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:05:19] or less
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:05:25] if not every network has it loaded
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:07:09] right.  The purpose of the module is to forward certain irc events to Google Glass.  To do that, the module needs to keep track of an access token to the Google APIs of which there should only be one per user, hence the use module.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:08:07] Several instances of the module can't use the same token?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:08:09] I don't need to call PutModule in OnLoad, originally I was calling it after receiving a code from the GoogleAPIs which the user needed to enter to grant the module access but that was failing too.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:09:01] Looks like your code simplified a lot since that :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:10:12] Actually, from socket callback we have the same situation
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:10:23] m_pNetwork is not set either
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:10:35] right, I had setup a timer and a message queue
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:11:09] Uh, where else besides OnLoad and sockets/timers do you have PutModule() not working? :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:12:16] right now, just onLoad and timer callbacks is all I've found :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:13:07] so you're implying I would not have these problems if I switched to a network module?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:13:26] Yes
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:14:10] Also it gives you an option to send messages to your glass only for some networks, and not for the others
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:14:20] alright, how would I manage associating data per user from within a network module?  I only need an OAuth refresh token to persist.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:16:09] Can they use independend refresh tokens?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:16:24] With one access token
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	DGandalf [13:16:37] doesn't know much about OAuth yet
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:16:59] user convenience really.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:17:21] Well... Fix ZNC then
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[13:17:31] And send a patch :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	dexter0	[13:18:11] I'll add that to my todo list  ;) Thanks for the help DGandalf

2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[21:56:03] Which somehow caused znc to crash!?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[21:59:46] sounds like a bug *captain obvious*
2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:00:50] yeah
2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:01:10] identfile stays hung up forever if the server the network used to connect to no longer exists
2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:08:16] funnily enough attaching gdb usually fixed it :p
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[22:09:11] I don't think there even is a hook for network deletion
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[22:09:23] so some magic will have to be applied (if it isn't already)

2013-10-15 11:12:49	Juvenal	[22:21:06] if you have more than say 5 users, it fucks up royally on network issues

2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:21:24] Then deleted it from the webui
2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:21:27] and znc crashed
2013-10-15 11:12:49	XReaper	[22:21:54] Juvenal: well, two users... crap tonnes of networks.. ish

2013-10-15 11:12:49	Juvenal	[22:23:20] but thats what i use on a bnc with about 15 users
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Juvenal	[22:23:29] zero issues
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:35:09] Yo guys, question. My znc stopped connecing to LinkNet and has been giving out "Disconnected from IRC (Broken pipe). Reconnecting..." for weeks already
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:35:17] Is there any way to fix this somehow?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:35:53] sounds like you need to buy znc a new pipe
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:36:07] as a server i have eu.link-net.org +7000 listed, meaning its NOT a one single server
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:36:36] znc version?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:36:55] ZNC 1.1-nightly-20130512-588e478f
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:37:53] do you have a bindhost set?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:38:44] Yessir, and im sure its correct, because i have the same bindhost for 5 other networks added under the same znc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:38:50] and those 5 other networks DO work
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:39:04] werid :?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:39:30] try adding a server by ip instead of host, also you can try clearing the bindhost or setting it to 0.0.0.0
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:39:57] bindhost is added by ip already
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:40:14] but is there maybe a command to reload or restart that one network/user thats having issues?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:41:55] /znc saveconfig and rehash would reload the conf, other than that you can only restart the whole znc process
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:42:34] aha...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:42:43] so, i just changed the bind to 0s
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:42:47] and the message becase Cannot connect to IRC (Permission denied). Retrying...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:43:49] added the old bind again
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:43:59] and again it became "Disconnected from IRC (Broken pipe). Reconnecting..."
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:44:01] crap
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:44:15] i mean, guys, i wish the EM were a little bit more informative :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:44:21] hmm......
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:45:42] is it your own server or a shell? does it have some limits for connections?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:46:01] shell, connections - no
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:46:10] the thing is that its been up for months
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:46:29] and only around 2 weeks ago this whole thing with ONLY this one network started
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:46:39] i had this broken pipe thing before
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:46:45] but it never lasted for weeks
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:47:15] hmmm
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:47:24] i ll try changing the bind to something else maybe
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	Diam0nd [00:47:31] is looking at vhosts list
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:50:10] changed bind
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:50:16] and again the same broken pipe thing
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:50:18] goddamn...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:50:50] any other ideas? anyone? :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:52:38] mirc crashed, im back, sorry. any1 said anything?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:52:56] did you try the linknet connection with something else? like irssi from the server or something?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:53:37] irssi?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:54:08] it's an irc client usually installed on shells
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:55:39] aha
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:55:52] never heard, but i ll have a look into it, thanks!!
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:56:12] is there a way to restart z from the web admin?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:56:24] im thinking maybe restart the whole thing first..
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:56:37] not from the webadmin, but you can msg *status for it
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:56:42] aha!
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:56:45] gracias!
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:59:50] okay, restart did not help
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[00:59:56] somebody please kill me NOW
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:15:34] guys, another question, whats the best way to update znc?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:15:39] id like to jump to 1.2
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:19:47] same way you would update any other version, make sure to read the changelog for any conf changes
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:19:57] not sure I'd want to use a beta version though for general use
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:25:45] well, regarding betas, ive been using nightlies like, forver. never had any issues
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:27:35] <nate> same way you would update any other version
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:27:37] :|
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:27:46] yeah, i asked the question to get exactly that kinda answer)))
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:29:12] You're looking to use a beta version but you want people to step by step you through exactly how to upgrade to it?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	nate [01:29:35] personally is of a belief if you're going to use a beta software then you should have at least the competency to actually look into how to run it yourself
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:30:11] The fact still stands though, changelog would cover any actual configuration changes I imagine you would need to know, and otherwise the install file would note any installation differences over 1.0
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:31:30] No, i thought there's either a simple way (e.g. stop the process, update files over a command or ftp), or a guide on updating (e.g. on wiki).
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:32:00] No offence, but if you dont have an answer to a question, why bother saying anything?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:32:10] Just good old common sense.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:34:04] o.O Because I had assumed, seeing as you apparently were already running ZNC, that you probably had at least a basic understanding of linux and updating binaries on it, which lead me to assume you were asking on updating configuration/compilation level stuff
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:34:27] (This being my own opinion of common sense that someone should probably understand the basics of their operating platform if they're compiling stuff anyways :P)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:34:28] Nosir
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:34:47] I don't see how being able to install znc OR running a beta is a testament to that kinda logic.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:35:01] I mean, install znc is not that hard and does NOT require much knowledge
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:35:13] other than being able to connect to a shell and run a few commands
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:35:25] which was kinda the point, lol
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:35:49] But in that case, general note of software on *nix; You can pretty much [re]compile on *nix while a process is still running
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:35:56] then just 'restart' it to use the new version
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[01:36:23] so basically leave ZNC run, compile the new one the same way/path you compiled 1.0, then restart ZNC after make (install), etc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:59:19] hmmmmmmm
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:59:35] how about replacing files? the way i always do it is use wget
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:59:40] then unzip
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[01:59:47] can i do the same thing now and replace the files?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:02:21] • nate • thank you so much for the answers though btw
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:02:32] i feel like im almost there with understanding updating too)))
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:03:41] :P
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:03:50] I wasn't trying to come off too dickish originally, really
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:04:01] and well, all the 'important' files will replace themselves automatically
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:04:25] That's why I said all you really gotta do is compile -> make -> make install
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:04:33] then restart ZNC
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:05:12] Most of it is pretty straight forward, but that's why I originally mentioned about checking the 1.2 changelog for any configuration file changes, if there were changes made in 1.2 that your 1.0 conf design isn't compatible with then ZNC won't start
2013-10-15 11:12:49	 *	nate [02:05:23] still uses 1.0 though so has no idea if there were or were not conf changes in 1.2
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:08:54] nah, but i mean, replace themselves from where?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:09:02] i thought i do the replacing first manually somehow
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:09:09] and them comple make and make install
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:09:29] Shouldn't, you just unpack the tarball and do what the install guide says
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:09:34] How did you install 1.0? o.O
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:10:52] ---
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:11:00] wget znc.in/nightly/znc-latest.tar.gz
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:11:00] tar -xzvf znc-latest.tar.gz

2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:11:12] hence me asking about replacing FIRST
2013-10-15 11:12:49	nate	[02:20:33] Yeah no, all in all you would do the same thing with 1.2 as far as I would imagine, same as you've been doing with the nightlies, only difference being you already have a conf so you shouldn't need to --makeconf unless you want to start fresh
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:48:01] aha
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:48:03] snap
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:48:06] thanks a lot, nate
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Diam0nd	[02:48:14] i ll try this tomorrow prolly

2013-10-15 11:12:49	Berserk	[21:21:31] anybody home?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne_	[02:27:29] someone should add 'anyone home?' to the pointless questions in the ZNCLinker thing
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[03:22:30] KindOne_: where's the patch?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne_	[03:36:08] DGandalf: pull it or whatever its called.. 
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[03:47:58] anyone home?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	ZNCLinker	[03:47:59] Pointless question detected! DGandalf, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you checked http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ before. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html Sorry if this is false alarm.

2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[03:48:02] ah
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Frogi	[08:42:11] hello
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Frogi	[08:43:34] how can i read channels logs (backlogs) on my phone client while having my desktop client open too
2013-10-15 11:12:49	rwxr	[21:03:40] i'm having some troubles with Linknet and ZNC
2013-10-15 11:12:49	rwxr	[21:03:58] i keep getting this: [Thu.14:00:45] <*status> IRC connection timed out.  Reconnecting...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	rwxr	[21:04:10] and i've tried with a bunch of different servers
2013-10-15 11:12:49	rwxr	[21:04:58] any ideas? it worked perfectly until just a few days ago and i haven't changed anything
2013-10-15 11:12:49	ZNCLinker	[00:12:53] [znc] schoentoon opened pull request #416: Implemented a nick compare function (master...master)  http://git.io/upnOzw
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[00:19:23] operator overloading, anyone?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[00:20:25] That one compares Nick with a string :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[00:56:37] bool CNick::operator ==(const std::string& s) const
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[00:56:46] thought this would work, but now I'm not sure anymore
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[00:57:16] but it's not that nice anyway
2013-10-15 11:12:49	lahwran	[00:58:25] in js terms 'cause I'm lazy, if CNick is {connection: x, nickname: y} then that isn't equal to nickname
2013-10-15 11:12:49	lahwran	[00:58:35] I mean, not in terms of an equality test, but in terms of the meaning of equality
2013-10-15 11:12:49	lahwran	[00:58:37] it's not equal
2013-10-15 11:12:49	edinazzu	[00:58:38] hello, im using an alpha release can i just install the 1.2 beta and use the old config?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@flakes	[01:02:36] edinazzu: yes
2013-10-15 11:12:49	edinazzu	[01:02:51] nice
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:33:51] Can anybody tell me why ZNC webinterface lists channels that i've parted?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:34:08] Would be nice if it cleared the list on disconnect or something
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:34:25] well, tell us more about the channel
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:34:36] what does /znc listchan say about them in the "State" column?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:34:49] *listchans
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:34:54] Hmm i've already cleared the list
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:35:02] then I don't know :p
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:35:03] Well its not the channel, its all che channels
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:35:06] the*
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:35:32] just parting a channel should delete it from znc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:35:43] Hehe that doesn't happen
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:35:53] Thats what baffeling me 
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:36:54] Didn't know there was an efnet channel :)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:36:56] well: when your client sends a /part for a channel that wasnt joined, znc deletes the channel
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:37:01] else it will just forward the part
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:37:26] when the PART comes back from the irc server, znc should then delete the channel
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:38:15] Yeah it has to do with disconnect, when I disconnect from the server the channels remain
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:39:53] Another thing that has been bothering me is when i click on del for a channel I go back to the user page :/ Whats up with that?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:40:00] (sorry to barge in and complain :P )
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:42:23] uhm, which one is "the server"? disconnect from znc or make disconenct from the irc server?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:43:38] the irc server
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:47:25] uhm, yeah, why should that delete any channels?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:47:36] znc will try to rejoin channels
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:49:36] Yeah but that doesn't work when channels are +i
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:49:49] true
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[02:49:59] set JoinTries to some non-zero value and znc will give up after that many attempts
2013-10-15 11:12:49	sWahili	[02:50:30] Yeah I've set it to 1
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[03:59:15] flakes: sure, bool CNick::operator ==(const std::string& s) const works
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[03:59:21] Just it's not that nice :)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:24:53] Hi, I'm having a problem with ZNC v1. I installed it successfully on Linux Debian and now I cannot connect to the server
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:25:02] I mean I cannot connect to the ZNC server
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:25:39] It says: "connecting" "connection established" "connection lost"
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:25:47] and this is localhost...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:26:13] Any ideas why it will always drop the connection? (server environment, no firewalls, etc)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:26:29] ssl on?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:27:10] yes
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:27:21] It's on on both ZNC and your client?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:27:31] I have to turn it on in my client?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:27:48] Sure, your client speaks plain text otherwise, not SSL
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:27:55] I use irssi and chatzilla clients. Hmm

2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:28:40] hm :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:29:19] thanks i connected on irssi now using -ssl
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:29:25] now to try chatzilla...
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:30:34] it works. im happy. thank you DGandalf :)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:32:05] That's the most common mistake :(
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:32:14] candise: how to make it less common?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:33:33] hmm
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:35:07] maybe put that info at the end of the installation page, or as a note near the SSL instructions: "if using ssl make sure to connect in your client like -ssl" or something!
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:35:27] what SSL instructions?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[04:37:37] yeah maybe there are none
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[04:37:56] not all clients have a -ssl switch
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:37:59] hm, thanks
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[04:38:14] didnt I once write an ugly and insecure hack so that csocket can accept ssl and non-ssl traffic on the same port?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@DGandalf	[04:38:31] You did
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@psychon	[04:38:32] that could be used to reply to plain text connects with "ERROR :You morron should use SSL\r\n"

2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:04:34] Hi. I accidentally added the wrong room to StickyChan. The room is #3x. Now every few seconds I get a message from a server: 'you are banned from room#3x'
2013-10-15 11:12:49	ZNCLinker	[23:04:35] https://github.com/znc/znc/pull/3 “Use Markdown for the README file” (closed)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:05:01] I did unstick. It still keeps trying to join the non-existent room
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:06:58] How can I stop vnc from trying to join a channel?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:10:05] ok, i think im free... i deleted it using webadmin
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:11:29] If I use sticky chan is it possible for me to accidentally leave a channel?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:11:43] as i accidentally left a channel before using stickychan
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:11:47] dunno how
2013-10-15 11:12:49	lahwran	[23:12:20] yes, but it's much harder
2013-10-15 11:12:49	candise	[23:13:28] ok, good
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:30:23] hello

2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:32:31] (the hostmask) ... sent a bad response.  Please verify that you have their correct password.
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:32:47] anyone?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:34:51] no one? really?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:35:51] no patience? really?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:36:33] "RESPONSE mypassword" do you mean you actually just sent your password?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:36:33] well i've tried to ask on every network i could think off
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:36:55] yes i did, was i supose to?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:37:07] i'm reading this article
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:37:08] http://wiki.znc.in/Autoop
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:37:26] what do you think the long random stuff in the challenge is all about?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:37:49] i've tried to send the challnege, and still the same warning message
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:38:02] something like RTEOAaFX+,0D58Si;o.);rHC4Z6vH3+b
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:38:14] on that wiki page, "How it works" step 3?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:38:58] hmmm, so my <response> should be (MD5(KEY + "::" + CHALLENGE))
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:38:59] ?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:39:12] yeap
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:39:37] no, still sent a bad response.  Please verify that you have their correct password. message
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:40:08] did you get a new challenge? it has a time limit
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:40:19] yes it's a new challenge
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:40:31] i've part from the channel and joined again for that
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:42:00] then i guess you're generating the response incorrectly
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:42:58] well shouln't that be generated from the znc itself?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[00:43:32] autoop is designed to work between two znc instances, but you're generating the response manually?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:44:19] no no, it's generated automaticaly, when the other users joins the channels specified in the *autoop
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:45:16] i've got it
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:45:25] anyway, tnx for the help in patience from me
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:45:38] it was __NOKEY__ to non-znc hostmask
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:45:50] and password for another znc user
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:46:06] as usual, read the manual first
2013-10-15 11:12:49	infernion	[00:46:21] the help and patience*
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Tusk	[01:24:15] hey guys, how would i go about getting setup with a znc, I was told it was much better than bnc
2013-10-15 11:12:49	haltdef	[01:29:41] install it?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Tusk	[01:39:19] sorry very little knowedge on all of this, I will have to read up after work, I was basically looking to getting a bnc but will read up after work
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Milliways	[01:40:04] znc is a bnc (bouncer)
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:47:55] Hi
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[21:48:04] mmm?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:48:12] I have znc bouncer set up
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:48:22] and I noticed if I connect to one network form one machine
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:48:25] and then another
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:48:42] both connections are live and work just fine, appearing as one user to the irc channel
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:49:25] Don't have a problem with that, but I was looking for a way to configure it so that some users could boot their other znc connection when they connect from another machine/client
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:49:39] Does anyone know a module for that? Or how to go about it?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[21:50:13] I don't know of any module that can do that
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:50:35] Fair enough
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:50:40] Guess I'll have to write one :D
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Milliways	[21:52:19] dont you just set up another account for that?
2013-10-15 11:12:49	@SilverLeo	[21:53:06] Jinux: do you mean you want to kick the older client away when you connect from another machine? you can do that by setting multiclients to false for the user
2013-10-15 11:12:49	KindOne	[21:53:23] oh wait, I forgot about that
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:53:28] Ah
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:53:40] I was wondering if there wass a config for it already, but didn't spot anything
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:53:45] lemme go check
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:54:24] ah I see
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:54:32] it's a tick box, not a configurable limit
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:57:02] That's that solved
2013-10-15 11:12:49	Jinux	[21:57:03] cheers :)

2013-10-16 11:36:55	karmine	its a bnc4free account
2013-10-16 11:36:55	meingtsla	That's weird. If you try doing "nslookup irc.choopa.net" does it return anything then?
2013-10-16 11:37:03	meingtsla	(if you have shell access to do that that is)
2013-10-16 11:37:05	karmine	refuses to efnet.....despite they are based on efnet
2013-10-16 11:37:26	karmine	lemme try that
2013-10-16 11:37:32	karmine	their guides are lackluster

2013-10-16 11:42:09	karmine	yes its bnc.....and i know a few.....good people who use it
2013-10-16 11:42:14	karmine	recommended it for efnet use
2013-10-16 11:42:21	meingtsla	Well, are you able to try another irc server on efnet? (Can't say I'm familiar with how bnc4free works, dunno if they let you select other efnet servers)

2013-10-16 11:43:37	karmine	just want a bnc to hide my ip
2013-10-16 11:43:54	meingtsla	Do you happen to know if it's connecting over ipv4 or ipv6? Because I haven't been able to connect to choopa over ipv6 in quite a while
2013-10-16 11:43:54	karmine	 i hang in a lot of questionable chans 
2013-10-16 11:44:01	karmine	im using v4

2013-10-16 11:44:16	karmine	i still use xp
2013-10-16 11:44:18	meingtsla	I would say try another efnet server
2013-10-16 11:44:24	karmine	i can v6 it but too much trouble
2013-10-16 11:44:30	karmine	got one in mind?

2013-10-16 11:44:44	meingtsla	http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers  should be relatively up to date
2013-10-16 11:44:45	karmine	something in maybe NL?
2013-10-16 11:44:46	karmine	lol

2013-10-16 11:48:19	KindOne	the ENTER key is not punctuation, you can shove a lot more text on a single line
2013-10-16 11:48:54	karmine	but sending a paragraph is tl;dr
2013-10-16 11:49:18	karmine	and you would bitch about reading actual english

2013-10-19 08:50:31	mechtn	can anyone point me to a service thats hosted where i can use my domain for znc?
2013-10-19 08:51:52	SourceX	mechtn: you should check out the amazon aws free tier and just host your own
2013-10-19 08:52:06	SourceX	unless you aren't comfortable with system administration
2013-10-19 08:53:37	mechtn	im a systems engineer so i can handle administration
2013-10-19 08:55:14	SourceX	yeah check out aws free tier
2013-10-19 08:55:27	SourceX	you get it for a year
2013-10-19 08:55:36	SourceX	1 micro linux and 1 micro windows vps
2013-10-19 09:02:56	mechtn	which service is the micro linux
2013-10-19 09:03:18	mechtn	Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  ?
2013-10-19 09:05:19	SourceX	you can use the virtual private cloud, but ec2 are the instances
2013-10-19 09:05:50	SourceX	vpc just gives you a private lan basically where you can boot up your ec2 instances inside
2013-10-19 09:07:32	mechtn	k so just ec2 is all i need?
2013-10-19 09:07:59	mechtn	any specific linux flavor easier to manage for znc?
2013-10-19 09:09:52	SourceX	all personal preference for the most part
2013-10-19 09:12:56	Jordy	what can be the issue if znc's connection gets forcefully killed with the reason fatal tls error?

2013-10-19 09:23:51	mechtn	downloading znc now
2013-10-19 09:27:15	mechtn	hrm
2013-10-19 09:27:18	mechtn	got issues :(
2013-10-19 09:31:35	SourceX	what issues?
2013-10-19 09:31:58	SourceX	Jordy: is that after it's been connected successfully for a while or?
2013-10-19 09:32:11	Jordy	yes
2013-10-19 09:32:37	SourceX	what is the reason the ircd gives for your disconnection?
2013-10-19 09:32:49	Jordy	fatal tls error
2013-10-19 09:32:53	mechtn	no compiler that i can find
2013-10-19 09:33:00	SourceX	mechtn: what distro?
2013-10-19 09:33:06	mechtn	i picked the redhat distro
2013-10-19 09:33:17	Jordy	compiled with debugmode which didn't give me an error
2013-10-19 09:33:18	SourceX	Jordy: oh, try running znc -D
2013-10-19 09:33:22	Jordy	i did
2013-10-19 09:33:25	SourceX	hmm
2013-10-19 09:33:26	Jordy	didn't give me an error
2013-10-19 09:33:37	SourceX	could possibly just be a timed out connection or something
2013-10-19 09:33:53	Jordy	no its something related to SSL
2013-10-19 09:33:54	SourceX	is it happening on one specific network or across multiple?
2013-10-19 09:34:02	Jordy	multiple
2013-10-19 09:34:19	SourceX	that's odd, i've never had that happen to me before
2013-10-19 09:34:25	SourceX	maybe someone else here will know more
2013-10-19 09:34:33	SourceX	sorry :\
2013-10-19 09:35:08	SourceX	mechtn: i'm not familiar with redhat's package names, but on debian based distros you need build-essentials which installs gcc and various relatives
2013-10-19 09:35:32	SourceX	you also need the ssl packages (on debian it's libssl-dev i think)
2013-10-19 09:35:48	mechtn	do you have to su or anything?
2013-10-19 09:36:07	mechtn	i tried yum install gcc but says i need to be root
2013-10-19 09:36:08	SourceX	yeah you wont be able to install packages globally without using su/sudo
2013-10-19 09:36:18	SourceX	try sudo yum
2013-10-19 09:36:32	mechtn	ah thats doing something
2013-10-19 09:36:52	Jordy	got them
2013-10-19 09:37:56	SourceX	Jordy: is this a new install or did this just start doing this out of the blue?
2013-10-19 09:38:08	Jordy	new install
2013-10-19 09:38:21	SourceX	what distribution?
2013-10-19 09:38:27	Jordy	Centos
2013-10-19 09:39:37	SourceX	can you paste the logs from znc -D with anything removed that is private
2013-10-19 09:40:10	Jordy	Not now. I will do tomorrow.
2013-10-19 09:40:47	mechtn	sourcex.. installing openssl too now
2013-10-19 09:41:04	SourceX	ok Jordy
2013-10-19 09:41:09	SourceX	mechtn okay
2013-10-19 09:43:51	mechtn	k znc is installing
2013-10-19 09:43:57	mechtn	do you know how to setup a custom domain with aws?
2013-10-19 09:45:47	SourceX	iirc you can set the reverse dns in the control panel
2013-10-19 09:46:02	SourceX	just point your domain/subdomain at the ip and adjust the reverse dns
2013-10-19 09:46:11	SourceX	if you want a static ip you'll have to get one of their elastic ips
2013-10-19 09:46:20	SourceX	i think they cost like $1.5 a month
2013-10-19 09:53:36	mechtn	when adding a ssl port
2013-10-19 09:53:38	mechtn	do you use the +
2013-10-19 09:53:40	mechtn	or not
2013-10-19 09:55:14	SourceX	yes
2013-10-19 09:55:20	SourceX	i think
2013-10-19 09:55:24	SourceX	sec let me test
2013-10-19 09:55:46	SourceX	yep
2013-10-19 09:59:25	mechtn	so you do need it
2013-10-19 10:10:49	SourceX	for ssl, yes
2013-10-19 10:12:44	mechtn	hrm
2013-10-19 10:12:48	mechtn	so i got my domain working
2013-10-19 10:12:54	mechtn	i can ssh over it to the aws server
2013-10-19 10:12:58	mechtn	znc is setup and running 
2013-10-19 10:13:03	mechtn	but unable to connect to it
2013-10-19 10:13:09	mechtn	security group is all open
2013-10-19 10:13:53	SourceX	what ip did you bind to?
2013-10-19 10:14:16	SourceX	i mean don't tell me the ip, but did you bind to 0.0.0.0 or the private ip?
2013-10-19 10:14:25	SourceX	you can't bind to the public ip as it's dhcp'd
2013-10-19 10:14:31	SourceX	unless you get a static (elastic) ip
2013-10-19 10:14:48	mechtn	bind host?
2013-10-19 10:15:01	mechtn	i left it blank as it said optional
2013-10-19 10:15:21	SourceX	okay that should bind to all then
2013-10-19 10:15:36	SourceX	well, the listener
2013-10-19 10:15:39	SourceX	is what i'm referring to
2013-10-19 10:16:05	SourceX	bind host is the outgoing ip you attempt to use
2013-10-19 10:16:24	mechtn	i dont think it asked for one
2013-10-19 10:16:30	mechtn	how do i look
2013-10-19 10:16:49	SourceX	nano ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf
2013-10-19 10:17:27	mechtn	listener 1 
2013-10-19 10:17:32	mechtn	doesnt have a IP . just port
2013-10-19 10:17:40	SourceX	okay that should bind to everything
2013-10-19 10:17:51	SourceX	and you said that you opened all the ports in the manager's security settings?
2013-10-19 10:18:22	mechtn	how can i stop and restart znc?
2013-10-19 10:19:16	mechtn	and does znc use tcp or udp
2013-10-19 10:19:22	mechtn	if i want to create a specific rule for the port
2013-10-19 10:26:02	meingtsla	tcp
2013-10-19 10:27:07	SourceX	mechtn: you start znc with `znc` or if you installed to a user directory instead of globally, `./znc`
2013-10-19 10:28:32	mechtn	hrm so i went back and change the setup with makeconf again
2013-10-19 10:28:42	mechtn	set the internal ip to listen
2013-10-19 10:28:45	mechtn	and changed the port
2013-10-19 10:28:46	mechtn	still not working
2013-10-19 10:29:27	mechtn	i know you can start it with znc
2013-10-19 10:29:27	SourceX	you don't want it on the internal ip as you can't access a LAN ip fromt he WAN
2013-10-19 10:29:31	mechtn	but how do you stop it
2013-10-19 10:29:52	SourceX	you can either shut it down from inside znc (/znc shutdown i think) or with pkill znc
2013-10-19 10:35:11	mechtn	this is frustrating
2013-10-19 10:35:17	mechtn	get to the last step and its not working
2013-10-19 10:35:53	SourceX	netstat -lnp | grep znc
2013-10-19 10:35:57	SourceX	check if it's listening
2013-10-19 10:38:24	mechtn	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1337                0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN
2013-10-19 10:38:55	SourceX	are you using ssl to connect?
2013-10-19 10:40:01	mechtn	no
2013-10-19 10:40:03	mechtn	when i assign it
2013-10-19 10:40:14	mechtn	the wan address in the config
2013-10-19 10:40:17	mechtn	znc wont start
2013-10-19 10:40:18	mechtn	[    ] Binding to port [1337] on host [xxxxx] using ipv4... [ Unable to[ !! ][Cannot assign requested address] ]
2013-10-19 10:41:02	SourceX	yeah don't use the wan address, it's a dhcp address so you can't actually bind to it like that
2013-10-19 10:41:23	SourceX	did you listen with ssl or nonssl?
2013-10-19 10:41:24	mechtn	i got an elastic address
2013-10-19 10:41:29	mechtn	nonssl
2013-10-19 10:42:07	SourceX	oh did you add the elastic address as a static ip in your networking configuration?
2013-10-19 10:42:22	mechtn	umm (maybe)
2013-10-19 10:42:31	mechtn	in linux?
2013-10-19 10:42:39	mechtn	or in the control panel for aws
2013-10-19 10:42:46	SourceX	see if there is a file: /etc/network/interfaces
2013-10-19 10:43:01	SourceX	i don't know redhat's specific layout so that may not be the location
2013-10-19 10:43:35	mechtn	there is /etc/networks
2013-10-19 10:43:56	mechtn	maybe /etc/sysconfig/network

2013-10-20 20:52:59	Jordy	is the Fatal TLS error fixed in 1.2?
2013-10-20 20:56:13	@SilverLeo	since you're the only one to ever report such a thing, i have no idea
2013-10-20 20:56:22	@SilverLeo	you should try it.
2013-10-20 20:56:36	@SilverLeo	or run znc with --debug to get some more info on it
2013-10-20 20:57:14	Jordy	Yes I did that. all it says is that it succesfully disconnected from IRC
2013-10-20 20:57:33	Jordy	And @ The IRCd it says user has diconnected (FATAL TLS ERROR RECEIVED)
2013-10-20 20:57:35	Jordy	or something
2013-10-20 20:57:49	@SilverLeo	pastebin the actual lines and some before it
2013-10-20 20:57:53	Jordy	Lastest OpenSSL compiled manualy
2013-10-20 20:57:54	Jordy	ok
2013-10-20 20:58:55	@SilverLeo	so why are you using a self compiled openssl?
2013-10-20 21:09:09	@DGandalf	SilverLeo: is ZNC fixed in 1.2? :)
2013-10-20 21:09:43	@psychon	Jordy: you could also get wireshark (or something like that) to look at the connection
2013-10-20 21:09:52	@psychon	TLS errors might be unencrypted (just signed)
2013-10-20 21:14:54	Jordy	http://pastebin.com/uZij11b9
2013-10-20 21:15:50	@SilverLeo	anything interesting above that SockError?
2013-10-20 21:16:12	Jordy	Nope just /who replies
2013-10-20 21:18:29	Jordy	I never ever experienced this it all worked fine until I got a centos box 
2013-10-20 21:18:58	@SilverLeo	so which version of openssl, and why did you get it manually?

2013-10-20 21:20:03	Jordy	1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
2013-10-20 21:20:17	Jordy	I like to compile stuff manualy and never got problems with it 
2013-10-20 21:20:25	Jordy	it works fine on IRSSI just not on ZNC

2013-10-20 21:21:32	Jordy	same SSL library yes
2013-10-20 21:22:41	@DGandalf	Jordy: upgrade
2013-10-20 21:22:51	Jordy	What do you want me to upgrade?
2013-10-20 21:23:01	@DGandalf	ZNC. At least it will show better error message
2013-10-20 21:23:08	@psychon	does it?
2013-10-20 21:23:18	Jordy	Wrong. it will show the same error.
2013-10-20 21:23:25	@DGandalf	Did you check?
2013-10-20 21:23:30	Jordy	I downgraded to see if it was related to ZNC 1.0
2013-10-20 21:23:35	@DGandalf	Or you know the future?
2013-10-20 21:23:45	@psychon	should we dump the ssl error stack to stdout?
2013-10-20 21:23:51	Jordy	ZNC 1.0 was the first on I tried
2013-10-20 21:24:02	Jordy	since its the only one at your website ;p
2013-10-20 21:24:14	Jordy	after that didn't work i searched for an older version
2013-10-20 21:24:47	@DGandalf	1.2/git fixed some error "success" messages from ssl
2013-10-20 21:24:59	@DGandalf	so 1.0 is still too old
2013-10-20 21:25:13	Jordy	i see
2013-10-20 21:27:46	@DGandalf	psychon: it has error stack?
2013-10-20 21:28:01	@psychon	DGandalf: yeah, a stack of useless error messages with file names and line numbers etc
2013-10-20 21:28:33	@psychon	DGandalf: see SSLErrors() in Csocket (oh, so we already do dump it...)

2013-10-20 21:35:53	@DGandalf	That's known issue... The number itself doesn't matter much anyway
2013-10-20 21:36:23	Jordy	Why does ZNC not have a errors.log btw? useful for experimenting with modules
2013-10-20 21:37:19	@DGandalf	Because noone wrote better logging for ZNC yet. It's either no logs, or stdout.
2013-10-20 21:37:25	@DGandalf	If you want to fix it, welcome

2013-10-21 21:39:20	l0cal	it is no mirc option i think. if i dont connect via znc bouncer, the ping / pong announce is hiding
2013-10-21 21:39:31	nimrod	there is a setting in mirc
2013-10-21 21:39:42	l0cal	ya i know this point. it is activ
2013-10-21 21:39:47	nimrod	oh LOL
2013-10-21 21:41:43	l0cal	well it is not critical. the msg comes every 10 minutes. but i dont understand why. without bouncer connection i dont geht this pong event

2013-10-28 18:45:57	herbmode	does znc not accept numbers within usernames?
2013-10-28 18:48:53	K999	I noticed it doesn't accept usernames starting with a number
2013-10-28 18:49:26	K999	but username [letter][numbers]* seems to work fine
2013-10-28 18:49:30	herbmode	yes, sorry
2013-10-28 18:49:37	herbmode	i meant starting with a number and containing numbers
2013-10-28 18:49:47	herbmode	so the issue is the first letter being a number
2013-10-28 18:49:59	K999	also irc doesn't accept nicknames starting with a number
2013-10-28 18:50:04	K999	(at least the networks I tried)
2013-10-28 18:50:23	herbmode	ye, thats true mostly

2013-10-30 09:33:05	anorax	I wonder what works better for a partyline - Inspircd or ZNC?
2013-10-30 09:34:17	GLolol	anorax, that really depends on how advanced of a partyline you want
2013-10-30 09:34:43	anorax	I just want to be able to have users join it and then if they're naughty, boot them out
2013-10-30 09:36:00	GLolol	well, afaik the znc partyline is very basic
2013-10-30 09:36:49	GLolol	i'm not sure /kick even works there
2013-10-30 09:37:03	GLolol	it's mainly for chat between znc users on one znc
2013-10-30 09:37:13	anorax	Yeh
2013-10-30 09:37:26	GLolol	you'd have to give everyone that you want to be able to join a znc account
2013-10-30 09:37:32	anorax	There should be distributed (link) function in ZNC
2013-10-30 09:38:05	GLolol	I don't think you can link znc partylines together
2013-10-30 09:38:06	GLolol	lol
2013-10-30 09:38:21	GLolol	if you need the functionality go with a proper ircd

2013-10-30 18:08:13	ZNCLinker	http://wiki.znc.in/identfile
2013-10-30 18:08:59	dgw	You could use %username% instead of %ident%, but then you wouldn't be able to specify your ident per-network
2013-10-30 18:11:21	Ritche	i got that
2013-10-30 18:11:35	Ritche	what I mean is only admin can change what you have put in ident section of the panel
2013-10-30 18:11:41	Ritche	while users cant change anything in there
2013-10-30 18:12:20	dgw	That would have to be a new option, I think.
2013-10-30 18:12:38	Ritche	yeah since I load turn on identfile
2013-10-30 18:12:50	Ritche	the users have access to change their ident and i want to disable it from them
2013-10-30 18:13:42	dgw	DGandalf or psychon might know something I don't, but as I understand it the way to force a particular ident is to use %username% in the format set in identfile. That affects all users, though, including admins.
2013-10-30 18:13:59	Ritche	or it is possible to disable users to access webadmin panel?
2013-10-30 18:14:36	dgw	There is likely an IRC command they could issue to change their ident anyway
2013-10-30 18:14:54	Ritche	arggg
2013-10-30 18:14:56	dgw	even if that were possible (and I don't believe it is)
2013-10-30 18:17:33	Ritche	afraid users will change their ident and try to impersonate
2013-10-30 18:20:58	dgw	Then tell identfile to SetFormat with %username% instead of %ident%. Users won't be able to impersonate each other (or the admin). But the admin will also lose the ability to have a custom ident.

2013-11-06 14:45:40	WanNaynEy	windows 7
2013-11-06 14:54:29	KindOne	you mean connect to it?
2013-11-06 14:55:23	WanNaynEy	well, kinda...coz it doesnt run 
2013-11-06 14:56:58	WanNaynEy	i had it downloaded...installed
2013-11-06 14:57:07	WanNaynEy	now it wont run
2013-11-06 14:58:18	@SilverLeo	so why exactly are you running it on your desktop?
2013-11-06 14:59:04	Raccoon	ZNC is a piece of software you install on "somebody else's computer" to allow you to pretend you are them.
2013-11-06 14:59:27	Raccoon	In practice, that "somebody else" is a virtual remote host that you pay a month fee to access.  A Shell Account or VPS.
2013-11-06 14:59:47	Raccoon	ZNC is free, the remote hosting is not.
2013-11-06 15:00:18	WanNaynEy	@SilverLeo : i knda wanna have an irc bouncer...that's y
2013-11-06 15:00:32	WanNaynEy	ic Raccoon 
2013-11-06 15:01:15	@SilverLeo	yea like Raccoon said, it's not much of a bouncer if you run it on the same computer as your irc client
2013-11-06 15:01:58	Raccoon	You could in theory run it at home, if you have multiple computers with irc clients all connecting as the same "nickname"
2013-11-06 15:02:12	Raccoon	So you can move from computer to computer while in the same irc session.
2013-11-06 15:02:16	WanNaynEy	hmmm....
2013-11-06 15:02:26	WanNaynEy	so i can do it here in our office then.
2013-11-06 15:02:45	Raccoon	eg, a mobile device that frequently connects and disconnects as you leave home and switch from wifi to 4g
2013-11-06 15:03:09	Raccoon	Whose office?

2013-11-08 00:55:51	Lobby	Yeah i know but i kinda.. forgot that
2013-11-08 00:56:01	Lobby	and i have tried all passes i can remember
2013-11-08 00:58:38	@flakes	log onto shell; shutdown znc; use znc --makepass; edit ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf; start ZNC again; voila new password
2013-11-08 00:59:17	Lobby	config stays yes? because i'm about to jump on you and kiss you wildly

2013-11-09 03:18:41	indelible	if you're using the webpanel in the bind hosts section, can you have comments to mark which IPs are whos?
2013-11-09 03:18:59	indelible	in global settings
2013-11-09 03:21:02	@DGandalf	if you want to make them "whos", go to user settings instead
2013-11-09 03:21:55	indelible	i thought i spelled that wrong
2013-11-09 03:22:24	@DGandalf	regardless of spelling
2013-11-09 03:22:52	@DGandalf	if that global list is empty, user may choose any host (just by typing it)
2013-11-09 03:23:10	@DGandalf	if that global list is not empty, user may choose only a host from the list, or default
2013-11-09 03:23:32	indelible	yea no, i was asking because theres like 20 ipv4 on here and even more ipv6
2013-11-09 03:24:03	@DGandalf	define "whos" then
2013-11-09 03:24:20	@DGandalf	what do you want to see and where?
2013-11-09 03:24:28	indelible	like
2013-11-09 03:24:56	indelible	192.168.0.1 #indelible.domain.tld
2013-11-09 03:24:59	indelible	and etc
2013-11-09 03:25:13	@DGandalf	ah.
2013-11-09 03:25:23	@DGandalf	why not just use the domain name?
2013-11-09 03:26:22	indelible	i do?
2013-11-09 03:26:34	@DGandalf	IP is in the list now?
2013-11-09 03:26:37	@DGandalf	Not domain?
2013-11-09 03:27:12	@DGandalf	bindhost may be DNS name, it will be resolved to IP just fine
2013-11-09 03:27:19	indelible	oh
2013-11-09 03:27:44	indelible	thats much easier then
2013-11-09 03:27:49	indelible	didnt know you could

2013-11-10 13:16:36	Chance_	missing info about TLS 1.2
2013-11-10 13:16:58	Chance_	the ZNC modules its a web server
2013-11-10 13:17:03	Chance_	the ZNC module* its a web server
2013-11-10 13:17:21	Chance_	and that web server is missing TLS 1.2 code
2013-11-10 13:17:36	@DGandalf	Chance_: any example of working website?
2013-11-10 13:17:45	Chance_	same one
2013-11-10 13:17:47	KindOne	IE10 is dead.. upgrade to IE11
2013-11-10 13:18:01	Chance_	https://85.240.183.198
2013-11-10 13:18:04	Chance_	working
2013-11-10 13:18:06	KindOne	assuming you are on Win6 sp1
2013-11-10 13:18:15	KindOne	s/6/7/
2013-11-10 13:18:15	ZNCLinker	KindOne meant: “assuming you are on Win7 sp1”
2013-11-10 13:18:26	Chance_	https://85.240.183.198 => lighttpd (working)
2013-11-10 13:18:42	Chance_	https://85.240.183.198:6698 => znc (not working)
2013-11-10 13:21:32	SourceX	well it's sending different cert data from :443 than from :6698
2013-11-10 13:21:37	SourceX	for instance:
2013-11-10 13:21:56	nate	Well the fact that everything but IE10 seems to be working makes me not think this is really ZNC's fault as much as probably IE with a bad native cipher support
2013-11-10 13:21:56	Chance_	its the same ssl data
2013-11-10 13:21:59	SourceX	Certificate chain |  0 s:/CN=chance.servebbs.com |    i:/CN=chance.servebbs.com
2013-11-10 13:22:04	Chance_	same pem
2013-11-10 13:22:10	SourceX	vs 0 s:/C=PT/ST=PT/L=PT/O=chance.servebbs.com/OU=chance.servebbs.com/CN=chance.servebbs.com
2013-11-10 13:22:20	Chance_	ok i can change it i created another one
2013-11-10 13:22:29	Chance_	but its the same EC
2013-11-10 13:22:33	Chance_	ive made some testings
2013-11-10 13:22:33	nate	the pem is irrelevant, the software itself is supporting the cipher, that's why for example in lighttpd, ssl.cipher-list exists
2013-11-10 13:22:44	Chance_	yes i know
2013-11-10 13:22:51	Chance_	but the ZNC does not support it
2013-11-10 13:23:14	SourceX	nate:  he also said chrome choked on it
2013-11-10 13:23:27	Chance_	ssl.cipher-list using it or not does not change anything in my case
2013-11-10 13:23:37	nate	I know, I mean they could throw in some 1.1 cipher support if anything, but at the same time I'm kinda with KindOne on this, IE10 should be updated anyways
2013-11-10 13:23:45	Chance_	cipher is always the same
2013-11-10 13:23:50	nate	SourceX: Chrome (as well as FF) both don't do 1.2 by default, you have to enable there as well
2013-11-10 13:23:55	nate	but Chrome should -definitely- support that cipher
2013-11-10 13:24:35	SourceX	indeed
2013-11-10 13:24:48	Chance_	;)
2013-11-10 13:25:12	nate	btw your 'regular' website with the lighty config has a rather huge amount of ciphers available (including weak ones), which is why you're not having any issue there really since there are plenty of fallbacks
2013-11-10 13:25:33	nate	but anyways, if anything ZNC should prob add some 1.1 ciphers at the very least
2013-11-10 13:25:42	Chance_	no
2013-11-10 13:25:52	Chance_	ohh yes
2013-11-10 13:25:54	KindOne	IE11 was released like yesterday?
2013-11-10 13:25:59	Chance_	i undestood now what you mean
2013-11-10 13:26:02	nate	thought it's been out a while now?
2013-11-10 13:26:51	SourceX	he forgot the </sarcasm>
2013-11-10 13:27:24	Chance_	it seems the software (ZNC) does not have support for those ciphers
2013-11-10 13:27:51	Chance_	i mean on the webadmin module
2013-11-10 13:28:09	Chance_	but firefox opens so...
2013-11-10 13:28:10	Chance_	lol
2013-11-10 13:28:11	nate	tbh I'd almost just expect ZNC to use the HIGH openssl ciphers, it is odd they restrict it to that specific cipher
2013-11-10 13:28:16	Chance_	no problem on ZNC...
2013-11-10 13:28:17	Chance_	hahaaha
2013-11-10 13:28:22	Chance_	now what?
2013-11-10 13:28:52	KindOne	define 'high'
2013-11-10 13:29:36	SourceX	literal HIGH in openssl cipher list
2013-11-10 13:29:40	nate	KindOne: openssl ciphers -v '-ALL:HIGH'
2013-11-10 13:30:26	nate	still not the 'strongest' line up, but would be far better than restricting to a specific very high grade TLS 1.2 cipher
2013-11-10 13:31:10	SourceX	or just use firefox ;)
2013-11-10 13:31:17	Chance_	that what im doiing
2013-11-10 13:31:18	Chance_	lol
2013-11-10 13:31:34	Chance_	the objective here was trying to figure this out
2013-11-10 13:31:38	Chance_	but i can do it...
2013-11-10 13:31:44	Chance_	its not a problem to me
2013-11-10 13:31:47	Chance_	firefox ;)
2013-11-10 13:32:11	SourceX	well there's obvious differences in what openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:6698 and openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:443 return
2013-11-10 13:32:16	@DGandalf	nate: ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 is in ALL too...
2013-11-10 13:32:28	Chance_	jeezz...
2013-11-10 13:32:32	Chance_	i will change the pem
2013-11-10 13:32:50	Chance_	theres no difference on the final conclusions
2013-11-10 13:32:53	nate	DGandalf: It's not the issue of supporting that it's the issue of ONLY supporting that one
2013-11-10 13:33:00	Chance_	the pem was the same but then i created another one
2013-11-10 13:33:04	nate	the ZNC 'webserver' seems to only support that cipher
2013-11-10 13:33:13	nate	which IE10 and previous will not connect under
2013-11-10 13:33:15	Chance_	yeah
2013-11-10 13:33:35	Chance_	but its the same EC pem
2013-11-10 13:33:36	nate	I mean ultimately I still think this is technically IE's fault for implementing poor TLS 1.2 support
2013-11-10 13:33:47	Chance_	what about opera?
2013-11-10 13:33:48	nate	but ZNC 'webserver' should probably at the very least have some TLS 1.0/1.1 fallback ciphers
2013-11-10 13:33:51	Chance_	what about Chrome?
2013-11-10 13:34:40	nate	like I said, chrome's TLS 1.2 support was hinky for a while and disabled by default at that as well, so you would have to confirm it's actually enabled as well
2013-11-10 13:34:52	nate	I think Firefox even only finally enabled TLS 1.2 by default in like 22.x or 23.x
2013-11-10 13:34:58	Chance_	but it works on apache, lighttpd, bla bla
2013-11-10 13:35:07	Chance_	chrome + tls1.2
2013-11-10 13:35:18	Chance_	ie + tls1.2
2013-11-10 13:35:23	Chance_	its only on ZNC
2013-11-10 13:35:35	SourceX	Chance_: that's why i was trying to compare output with the openssl client...
2013-11-10 13:35:41	Chance_	ok
2013-11-10 13:35:46	Chance_	so i will change it for you
2013-11-10 13:35:47	Chance_	1m
2013-11-10 13:36:03	@DGandalf	nate: what's needed to support TLS 1.2? No new openssl API need to use?

2013-11-10 13:37:53	SourceX	DGandalf: i think you just need 1.0.1e or higher
2013-11-10 13:38:07	nate	Chance_: Like I said your lighttpd configuration has an epic -fuckton- of fallback ciphers; http://paste.st-projects.com/95f7f5920a <-- this is why everything works on your lighttpd config
2013-11-10 13:38:34	nate	1.0.1c I believe and forward should have all the main TLS 1.2 stuff yeah
2013-11-10 13:38:40	Chance_	sorry
2013-11-10 13:38:40	Chance_	sorry
2013-11-10 13:38:40	Chance_	sorry
2013-11-10 13:38:50	Chance_	lighttpd was using RSA
2013-11-10 13:38:53	SourceX	1.0.1c only had partial support iirc
2013-11-10 13:38:54	Chance_	thats why
2013-11-10 13:39:01	nate	Chance_: As it should technically
2013-11-10 13:39:12	Chance_	but chillout...
2013-11-10 13:39:32	Chance_	1m
2013-11-10 13:39:35	nate	SourceX: perhaps, I thought that's when they implemented it mostly though
2013-11-10 13:40:01	Chance_	no...
2013-11-10 13:40:08	Chance_	no ive got it
2013-11-10 13:40:22	nate	Chance_: ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:DES-CBC3-MD5
2013-11-10 13:40:27	nate	for your light ssl.cipher-list
2013-11-10 13:40:39	Chance_	yeah its set that way
2013-11-10 13:40:53	Chance_	HIGH:ECDHE-ECDSA bla bla
2013-11-10 13:41:09	SourceX	actually it looks like 1.0.1e still might only have partial support
2013-11-10 13:41:13	nate	Chance_: Definitely not, you are loading way differen ciphers than that, but with that in mind you might wish to read; http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa_2013_01.txt
2013-11-10 13:41:39	Chance_	the pem is the same but on lighttpd i can force ECDHE
2013-11-10 13:41:39	nate	You may be falling 'victim' to that particular bug I recently discovered myself, if you have any form of SNI config going (which would be weird for an IP, but...), ssl.cipher-list doesn't inherit properly at the moment
2013-11-10 13:41:47	Chance_	and on ZNC it will use RSA on the same PEM
2013-11-10 13:42:05	nate	Like was already said, the pem is irrelevant, the pem has nothing to do with the cipher being provided by the 'webserver' :P
2013-11-10 13:42:13	Chance_	i know
2013-11-10 13:42:15	nate	you could use the same pem on everything, it's up to the webserver to handle the cipher exchange
2013-11-10 13:42:25	Chance_	but then...
2013-11-10 13:42:47	Chance_	explain me how i changed the PEM from lighttpd to ZNC.PEM and now its working
2013-11-10 13:42:50	Chance_	!??!
2013-11-10 13:43:17	nate	I thought you already said they -were- the same?

2013-11-11 00:25:16	schorsch	i can't connect to webadmin gui (http://<my_znc_ip>:<my_znc_port>) .. globale webadmin module is loadet .. any hint? i compiled znc from the nightly build .. ZNC 1.0 - IPv6: yes, SSL: yes, DNS: threads
2013-11-11 00:25:51	Chance	try firefox
2013-11-11 00:25:56	Chance	you will be surprised
2013-11-11 00:26:02	Chance	;)
2013-11-11 00:26:07	Chance	https://
2013-11-11 00:26:11	Chance	not http://
2013-11-11 00:27:23	@DGandalf	Chance: https://85.240.183.198/ doesn't open for me in opera either, now...
2013-11-11 00:27:26	@DGandalf	It did before
2013-11-11 00:27:39	schorsch	i'm on ffyou made my day!
2013-11-11 00:27:41	schorsch	:))
2013-11-11 00:27:53	Chance	maybe the ip changed
2013-11-11 00:27:53	Chance	1m
2013-11-11 00:27:53	schorsch	thx a lot!
2013-11-11 00:28:02	Chance	;)
2013-11-11 00:28:11	@DGandalf	no, it shows the same error as on 6698 port
2013-11-11 00:28:12	Chance	schorsch had the same problem see?
2013-11-11 00:28:14	schorsch	\o/
2013-11-11 00:28:51	Chance	whats your used cipher schorsch?
2013-11-11 00:28:55	schorsch	znc is a marvellous bnc
2013-11-11 00:29:08	Chance	thats weird DGandalf
2013-11-11 00:29:12	Chance	can you open it with firefox?
2013-11-11 00:29:56	@DGandalf	yes, on both ports
2013-11-11 00:30:19	Chance	you tell me ;)
2013-11-11 00:30:34	@DGandalf	I tell you what?
2013-11-11 00:30:43	Chance	what is happening
2013-11-11 00:30:49	Chance	since 443 is ok with all browsers
2013-11-11 00:30:56	@DGandalf	443 is not ok
2013-11-11 00:30:57	@DGandalf	now
2013-11-11 00:31:06	Chance	only with opera?
2013-11-11 00:31:10	Chance	but i changed the PEM file remember?
2013-11-11 00:31:14	Chance	now im using the same one
2013-11-11 00:31:15	@DGandalf	I don't have other browsers installed
2013-11-11 00:31:17	Chance	so thats normal
2013-11-11 00:31:20	@DGandalf	Only opera and ff
2013-11-11 00:31:34	@DGandalf	Yeah, you now use the same PEM for 443 and for 6698
2013-11-11 00:31:35	Chance	whats your opera version?
2013-11-11 00:31:36	Chance	last?
2013-11-11 00:31:40	@DGandalf	And they started behaving the same
2013-11-11 00:31:53	@DGandalf	12.16
2013-11-11 00:31:56	@DGandalf	The last opera :(
2013-11-11 00:32:26	Chance	@DGandalf  And they started behaving the same
2013-11-11 00:32:33	Chance	firefox opens 443?
2013-11-11 00:32:41	@DGandalf	ff opens 443
2013-11-11 00:32:44	@DGandalf	ff opens 6698
2013-11-11 00:32:48	@DGandalf	opera doesn't open 443
2013-11-11 00:32:50	@DGandalf	opera doesn't open 6698
2013-11-11 00:32:54	Chance	ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ok
2013-11-11 00:32:55	Chance	now i got it
2013-11-11 00:32:56	Chance	sorry
2013-11-11 00:33:07	Chance	but you will be surprised because...
2013-11-11 00:33:12	Chance	chrome will open 443
2013-11-11 00:33:16	Chance	and not 6698
2013-11-11 00:33:22	Chance	ie will open 443
2013-11-11 00:33:25	Chance	and not 6698
2013-11-11 00:33:31	Chance	i will test opera here
2013-11-11 00:33:32	Chance	1m
2013-11-11 00:33:36	Chance	gonna install it
2013-11-11 00:34:51	Chance	opera is old
2013-11-11 00:34:52	Chance	your version
2013-11-11 00:34:57	Chance	17.0
2013-11-11 00:35:06	Chance	is the last one
2013-11-11 00:35:08	@DGandalf	No
2013-11-11 00:35:15	Chance	no?
2013-11-11 00:35:16	@DGandalf	That's chromium
2013-11-11 00:35:19	@DGandalf	Opera is 12.16
2013-11-11 00:35:27	@DGandalf	Newer operas are chromium too
2013-11-11 00:35:35	@DGandalf	And they are not released for linux anyway
2013-11-11 00:35:43	Chance	http://www.opera.com/pt/computer/windows
2013-11-11 00:35:56	Chance	thats were i download it from
2013-11-11 00:36:06	ZAPhoeniX	14+ is chrome opera
2013-11-11 00:36:20	@DGandalf	Opera changed its engine to chromium after 12.16
2013-11-11 00:36:27	Chance	ok
2013-11-11 00:36:30	Chance	but...
2013-11-11 00:36:39	Chance	this 17 works with 443 and not with 6698
2013-11-11 00:36:43	Chance	one more to join the club
2013-11-11 00:37:00	@DGandalf	Well, you already said that chrome does that
2013-11-11 00:37:07	Chance	yeah
2013-11-11 00:37:14	Chance	something could be changed
2013-11-11 00:37:16	Chance	somehow
2013-11-11 00:37:23	@DGandalf	You can try older opera
2013-11-11 00:37:26	Chance	ok
2013-11-11 00:37:29	@DGandalf	which is not yet chromium
2013-11-11 00:37:45	Chance	older probably does not support TLS 1.2
2013-11-11 00:38:05	@DGandalf	hmm
2013-11-11 00:38:41	Chance	thats why
2013-11-11 00:39:00	Chance	@DGandalf  opera doesn't open 443
2013-11-11 00:39:00	Chance	16:32 @DGandalf  opera doesn't open 6698
2013-11-11 00:39:03	Chance	it makes sense
2013-11-11 00:40:03	Chance	i noticed something...
2013-11-11 00:40:09	Chance	ZNC is able to work with TLS 1.2
2013-11-11 00:40:16	Chance	but not with all ciphers
2013-11-11 00:41:28	Chance	ECDH/E-ECDSA => znc works but webadmin module dont supports
2013-11-11 00:41:34	Chance	but this doesnt make sense also
2013-11-11 00:41:40	Chance	because firefox is able to open it
2013-11-11 00:42:00	Chance	even with ECDH/E-ECDSA
2013-11-11 00:42:17	Chance	weird thing here
2013-11-11 00:43:10	@DGandalf	Just some browsers don't support TLS 1.2
2013-11-11 00:43:26	@DGandalf	And your previous PEM was different
2013-11-11 00:43:26	Chance	not it this case
2013-11-11 00:43:30	Chance	yes it was
2013-11-11 00:43:47	Chance	if they dont support TLS 1.2 they would not open 443
2013-11-11 00:44:09	Chance	the other PEM was ECDH-RSA
2013-11-11 00:44:17	Chance	this one is ECDH-ECDSA
2013-11-11 00:44:18	@DGandalf	oh
2013-11-11 00:44:22	Chance	thats the difference
2013-11-11 00:49:53	Chance	i found another thing DGandalf
2013-11-11 00:50:17	Chance	theres really a limitation factor on the ZNC software
2013-11-11 00:50:28	Chance	i mean with the cipher
2013-11-11 00:51:03	Chance	Protocol : TLSv1.2
2013-11-11 00:51:03	Chance	Cipher : ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2013-11-11 00:51:11	Chance	6698
2013-11-11 00:51:28	Chance	Protocol : TLSv1.2
2013-11-11 00:51:28	Chance	Cipher : ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2013-11-11 00:51:33	Chance	443
2013-11-11 00:51:36	Chance	same PEM
2013-11-11 00:53:55	@flakes	same client too?
2013-11-11 00:54:10	Chance	sure
2013-11-11 00:54:21	Chance	see yourself
2013-11-11 00:54:29	Chance	openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:443
2013-11-11 00:54:31	Chance	openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:6698
2013-11-11 01:03:25	Chance	any thoughts?
2013-11-11 01:07:01	Chance	its incredible the difference of speed on between old HTTPS RSA and now ECDH

2013-11-11 02:05:28	nate	Chance: How exactly were you generating the pem to begin with?
2013-11-11 02:05:33	nate	or does ZNC generate it w/ settings?
2013-11-11 02:05:37	 *	nate has never used the znc webmin thing so
2013-11-11 02:05:43	Chance	no
2013-11-11 02:05:51	Chance	ZNC only generates RSA pem files
2013-11-11 02:06:13	Chance	if you want a ec you need to create it manually
2013-11-11 02:06:42	nate	you were using an EC cert for lighty as well? o.O
2013-11-11 02:06:59	Chance	ive done alot of testings...
2013-11-11 02:07:05	Chance	different pems etc etc
2013-11-11 02:07:07	Chance	rsa
2013-11-11 02:07:08	Chance	dsa
2013-11-11 02:07:08	Chance	ec
2013-11-11 02:07:10	Chance	bla bla
2013-11-11 02:07:20	Chance	but then i conclude the best fit for me was EC
2013-11-11 02:07:29	Chance	ircd EC
2013-11-11 02:07:31	Chance	znc EC
2013-11-11 02:07:40	Chance	lighttpd EC
2013-11-11 02:07:42	Chance	all EC
2013-11-11 02:07:53	Chance	then i noticed this problem ONLY with ZNC
2013-11-11 02:08:05	Chance	firefox works great
2013-11-11 02:08:10	Chance	its the only one
2013-11-11 02:08:24	Chance	but this is weird using the same pem file
2013-11-11 02:08:38	Chance	16:50 Chance  Protocol : TLSv1.2
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:50 Chance  Cipher : ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:51 Chance  6698
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:51 Chance  Protocol : TLSv1.2
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:51 Chance  Cipher : ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:51 Chance  443
2013-11-11 02:08:39	Chance	16:51 Chance  same PEM
2013-11-11 02:08:43	Chance	16:54 Chance  openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:443
2013-11-11 02:08:43	Chance	16:54 Chance  openssl s_client -connect 85.240.183.198:6698
2013-11-11 02:09:03	Chance	it means ZNC cannot handle the same cipher
2013-11-11 02:09:43	nate	tbh I really have little experience with EC certs as I know of very few things actually using them
2013-11-11 02:10:02	nate	I figured you were just using regular RSA certs since that's pretty much what everything uses, lol
2013-11-11 02:10:12	nate	not even sure actual SSL CA's will do EC certs
2013-11-11 02:10:40	Chance	yes offcourse they use
2013-11-11 02:11:02	nate	well generally every CA I've dealt with straight up says "Provide an RSA... etc etc"
2013-11-11 02:11:04	nate	:P
2013-11-11 02:11:15	Chance	yes i know and you are right its more common RSA
2013-11-11 02:11:24	nate	you mean less
2013-11-11 02:11:55	Chance	less EC more RSA
2013-11-11 02:12:02	nate	yeah, lol
2013-11-11 02:12:04	Chance	see this
2013-11-11 02:12:47	Chance	https://www.google.pt/
2013-11-11 02:12:51	Chance	open it with chrome
2013-11-11 02:13:04	Chance	go the the green lock
2013-11-11 02:13:08	Chance	and press CONNETION
2013-11-11 02:14:09	Chance	do the same to
2013-11-11 02:14:11	Chance	https://www.flashfxp.com/
2013-11-11 02:14:21	nate	I don't have chrome installed offhand and I haven't gotten my virtualbox setup yet so you'll have to like screenshot whatever you're trying to show
2013-11-11 02:14:30	Chance	ok
2013-11-11 02:14:32	Chance	1m
2013-11-11 02:14:55	nate	because as far as I can tell through a generic openssl connection, google.pt's certificate is RSA
2013-11-11 02:15:58	nate	same with flashfxp.com, also RSA
2013-11-11 02:17:50	Chance	i dont see the same on google
2013-11-11 02:18:51	nate	like I said, screenshot what you're looking at, because I think you're confusing the 'Connection strength' with the certificate
2013-11-11 02:19:02	nate	which are completely irrelevant
2013-11-11 02:19:29	nate	an RSA certificate (pem) uses the same ciphers as an ECDSA one
2013-11-11 02:19:53	Chance	2 more minutes...
2013-11-11 02:20:14	Chance	yeah i know
2013-11-11 02:20:19	Chance	but thats not my point
2013-11-11 02:21:13	nate	No the point is you were trying to use them as examples that use ECDSA certificate/pem's and they don't :P
2013-11-11 02:21:46	Chance	sort of
2013-11-11 02:21:52	Chance	my main point
2013-11-11 02:21:53	Chance	is...
2013-11-11 02:22:00	nate	which now leads me to assume the original issue probably was the fact that IE 10 can't recognize ECDSA certificates probably
2013-11-11 02:22:17	nate	which still means it's not probably a ZNC issue, lol
2013-11-11 02:22:26	Chance	we are not talking about IE only here...
2013-11-11 02:22:34	Chance	we are talking about ALL browsers
2013-11-11 02:22:41	Chance	only firefox works
2013-11-11 02:23:05	nate	Opera most likely would have as well as they usually keep ahead on the SSL stuff, but doesn't change the fact you're using a certificate format that like
2013-11-11 02:23:09	nate	0.1% of the web probably uses
2013-11-11 02:23:13	nate	It has nothing to do with ZNC
2013-11-11 02:23:48	Chance	i know that ZNC is working because other way firefox would not work
2013-11-11 02:24:09	Chance	and theres any kind of error with -D
2013-11-11 02:24:17	nate	I have no idea what you read that implied using an ECDSA certificate was the 'best idea', but if it was and was actually broadly supported, don't you think sites like google, youtube, yahoo, wikipedia, etc would be using them?  They all still use RSA certificates
2013-11-11 02:24:21	Chance	so definitely ZNC is working
2013-11-11 02:25:07	Chance	google uses the EXACT same as my site
2013-11-11 02:25:25	nate	no it does not, it's using similar ciphers, not the 'exact' same certificate
2013-11-11 02:25:26	Chance	that the printscreens i wanna to show you
2013-11-11 02:25:30	nate	I'm still waiting for that screenshots, lol
2013-11-11 02:25:43	Chance	ok but its ECDHE-ECDSA
2013-11-11 02:25:47	Chance	wait
2013-11-11 02:25:48	nate	That is a CIPHER
2013-11-11 02:25:52	Chance	yes i know
2013-11-11 02:25:55	nate	Not a CERTIFICATE ALGORITHM
2013-11-11 02:25:58	nate	massive god damned difference
2013-11-11 02:25:58	nate	lol
2013-11-11 02:26:05	Chance	compare the algorith on my site
2013-11-11 02:26:08	Chance	and on google
2013-11-11 02:26:09	nate	I already have
2013-11-11 02:26:18	nate	Google uses a SHA1 RSA certificate signature
2013-11-11 02:26:23	Chance	what were your conclusions?
2013-11-11 02:26:28	Chance	and on my site?
2013-11-11 02:26:35	nate	You are using a SHA1 ECDSA
2013-11-11 02:26:42	Chance	what?
2013-11-11 02:26:46	Chance	wait
2013-11-11 02:26:47	nate	that is what an EC pem is
2013-11-11 02:26:49	nate	It's ECDSA
2013-11-11 02:27:09	Chance	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2013-11-11 02:27:10	nate	an EC pem has an ECDSA signature
2013-11-11 02:27:25	nate	This is what I've been trying to say, it's how you made your -pem- that's the issue, not ZNC
2013-11-11 02:27:28	Chance	thats why the other pem was working
2013-11-11 02:27:29	nate	you need to make an -rsa- PEM
2013-11-11 02:27:31	nate	yes
2013-11-11 02:27:34	nate	because it was most likely RSA

2013-11-12 04:26:54	duckdown	what is this all about?
2013-11-12 04:27:10	duckdown	theres nothing wrong with the vhost
2013-11-12 04:27:16	duckdown	i can connect with it using irssi no problem
2013-11-12 04:30:06	@SilverLeo	does the connection work without a vhost? and does it work with an ip instead of the hostname?
2013-11-12 04:31:24	duckdown	let me try with the IP, maybe that has something to do with it, thanks :)
2013-11-12 04:31:55	Sk1llSh0t	i know i've never been able to connect to the name. i've always had to use the IP in order to connect

2013-11-14 03:33:44	@psychon	yes, it is called "perform"
2013-11-14 03:33:50	@psychon	how often are you changing your user modes?
2013-11-14 03:35:21	Xesxen	not much, but it doesn't maintain the user mode on reconnect, so I have to re-set it
2013-11-14 03:36:49	@psychon	yeah, add an entry to perform to do that for you

2013-11-14 16:36:32	KindOne	out of curiosity, what kind of cpu? make/model?
2013-11-14 16:37:03	wodim	celeron @ 1.2ghz
2013-11-14 16:37:10	wodim	i think i found the culprit thanks to strace
2013-11-14 16:37:23	KindOne	what was it?
2013-11-14 16:37:24	@psychon	all I can say is: there are three ZNC instances on znc.in and none of them show up in top as using cpu time
2013-11-14 16:38:51	wodim	problem fixed
2013-11-14 16:39:02	wodim	i had connect delay set to 0, and you probably know the rest
2013-11-14 16:39:56	@psychon	which also means you had one network which failed to connect to irc
2013-11-14 16:40:13	wodim	yes, but i dont connect to all of my networks. (that's why i use znc and not only irssi)
2013-11-14 16:40:14	@psychon	but yeah, znc could be a little more intelligent with that
2013-11-14 16:40:24	wodim	not really
2013-11-14 16:40:27	KindOne	patches welcome :P
2013-11-14 16:40:36	wodim	in fact i'm happy it was using 10% cpu because that means it did what i told it to do
2013-11-14 16:40:41	wodim	instead of stop reconnecting
2013-11-14 16:41:15	@psychon	then you also had ServerThrottle set to 0?
2013-11-14 16:41:27	wodim	yep
2013-11-14 16:41:29	@psychon	otherwise it would be busy doing nothing (except for waiting for the server throttle to expire)

2013-11-14 16:42:13	wodim	i had everything set to 0 because on some users i have a big list of servers, where several ones are known to time out
2013-11-14 16:42:16	@psychon	ServerThrottle = 0 isn't the best idea, some networks will disconnect you with "Reconnecting too fast" if you reconnect too often in x seconds
2013-11-14 16:42:27	wodim	and znc freezes on connection attempts
2013-11-14 16:42:28	@psychon	that would then turn into a persistent DoS attack ;-)
2013-11-14 16:42:41	@psychon	uhm? are you on windows or some BSD?
2013-11-14 16:42:50	wodim	no
2013-11-14 16:42:56	wodim	i even reported it
2013-11-14 16:43:02	@psychon	the only known reason for znc to freeze is when it has to do blocking DNS resolving

2013-11-14 16:43:28	wodim	if znc is attempting to connect and the remote machine isn't there, i can't disconnect
2013-11-14 16:43:31	@psychon	that doesn't sound too much like a freeze
2013-11-14 16:43:32	wodim	znc ignores it
2013-11-14 16:43:46	wodim	well :P
2013-11-14 16:44:38	@psychon	oh, that does count as a bug...
2013-11-14 16:45:19	@psychon	the CIRCNetwork instance only learns about the irc socket after the connection was established successfully
2013-11-14 16:45:25	@psychon	so it cant close the socket before that...
2013-11-14 16:45:41	@psychon	hm, no...
2013-11-14 16:48:26	wodim	if it can't be fixed, it's ok, but at least don't make me feel bad for having those two vars set to 0 :P

2013-11-15 05:15:38	@psychon	wow, no bug report yet in gentoo about the newest xcb release being broken
2013-11-15 05:16:04	wired	what version?
2013-11-15 05:16:12	@psychon	they do have the non-issue https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490928 .....
2013-11-15 05:16:27	@psychon	last friday there was xcb-proto 1.9 and libxcb 1.9.2 and 1.9.3
2013-11-15 05:16:36	@psychon	I'll release xcb-proto 1.9.1 and libxcb 1.9.4 "soon"
2013-11-15 05:18:06	@psychon	xcb-proto 1.9 accidentally made libxcb break the ABI for libxcb-xkb.so and qt5 segfaults due to that
2013-11-15 05:18:27	@psychon	however, it also caused a (completely different) API break and thus qt5 can't be recompiled against the newer version
2013-11-15 05:18:34	@psychon	the fun of using a code generator...
2013-11-15 05:19:52	wired	whoa
2013-11-15 05:19:57	wired	nice :P
2013-11-15 05:20:41	@psychon	and all of that just because $SOMEONE showed up on wednsday, sent some patches for xcb to the wrong mailing list (the xcb list was only CC'd accidentally on a reply) and demanded a new release on friday
2013-11-15 05:21:00	@psychon	because that's when mesa has feature freeze and otherwise mesa would need to wait for half a year for $COOL_FEATURE...
2013-11-15 05:21:15	@psychon	so all of this was a little rushed... and no, $SOMEONE wasn't sitting on those patches since months...
2013-11-15 05:21:36	@psychon	meh, znc has way more interesting issues than these annoying ones

2013-11-18 14:44:52	billy-jon	does znc compile x64?
2013-11-18 14:46:23	@SilverLeo	sure
2013-11-18 14:46:43	billy-jon	hmm.  then im not sure what's wrong... autoconf is not finding openssl even when i manually specify the lib path.
2013-11-18 14:46:58	billy-jon	i guess i will manually compile autoconf's test file and see what the error is?
2013-11-18 14:47:14	KindOne	install openssl-dev
2013-11-18 14:47:33	KindOne	or libssl-dev depending on your flavor of *nix
2013-11-18 14:47:39	billy-jon	im on ubuntu
2013-11-18 14:48:04	billy-jon	(their apt package seems severely out of date, by the way)
2013-11-18 14:48:31	billy-jon	checking for openssl... no
2013-11-18 14:48:32	billy-jon	checking for BIO_new in -lcrypto... yes
2013-11-18 14:48:32	billy-jon	checking for SSL_shutdown in -lssl... yes
2013-11-18 14:48:51	billy-jon	that's odd that it couldn't find 'openssl' but it could find -lssl... but w/e it said "openssl: yes" at the end so i guess im okay?

2013-11-20 18:16:50	Toborrow	Si j'ai bien compris son fonctionnement, on s'y connecte à la place de se connecter directement au serveur IRC, pour avoir une prise en charge du push notamment
2013-11-20 18:17:21	Toborrow	Donc j'ai installé et configuré znc, je peux m'y connecter, et je peux discuter sur mon serveur IRC via ZNC
2013-11-20 18:17:41	Toborrow	Mais, dans la console, je vois plein de "zncuser PUSH Unknown command"

2013-11-21 01:29:51	tehloki	i think i remember some kind of thing where you could send them all to a fake user that PMs you like *status, then ignore it from irssi

2013-11-21 12:32:11	Ritche	the webadmin panel
2013-11-21 12:32:24	Ritche	i wanted to disable user from using it or disable user from editing the vhost option
2013-11-21 12:32:51	@DGandalf	then webadmin is not enough for you... it may be easily edited from IRC
2013-11-21 12:33:20	Ritche	oh how can I do that sir
2013-11-21 12:33:33	Ritche	disable both

2013-11-23 13:46:43	@DGandalf	SourceX: does it show any errors while compiling it?
2013-11-23 13:47:44	SourceX	DGandalf: i forgot i asked that, but i removed the modules/.depend/module.o.dep or w/e file along with the .so's that were compiled and the .o in modules/ and it fixed itself
2013-11-23 13:48:08	SourceX	so i assume it was probably that .depend file with something buggy in it
2013-11-23 13:50:11	@DGandalf	Well, znc-buildmod doesn't write to .depend...
2013-11-23 13:50:51	@DGandalf	make does, so probably you tried to run make without having .so with proper LIBS already
2013-11-23 13:51:03	@DGandalf	And it wrote the wrong .depend
2013-11-23 13:51:26	@DGandalf	Not sure how wrong it could be though

2013-11-23 14:03:37	SourceX	as a one liner so i wouldn't have to type it over and over as i made changes
2013-11-23 14:04:07	SourceX	so the .so would have existed the whole time

2013-11-27 02:28:54	resize	the webadmin shows the right value, but when i connect it doesnt set it as that value
2013-11-27 02:30:23	@SilverLeo	resize: have you read this whole page [[Identfile]] ?

2013-11-27 02:34:20	@SilverLeo	then your provider has probably locked your ident and you cannot change it
2013-11-27 02:36:43	@SilverLeo	you should still be able to read the /etc/oidentd.conf file to make sure

2013-11-29 08:28:04	spline	I noticed that *autovoice has "case sensitive" hosts in the userlist - isn't irc case-insens when it comes to hostmask (unless you want it to be case-sens) ?
2013-11-29 08:56:28	T_D_H	thats wrong in a sense
2013-11-29 08:56:48	T_D_H	some ircd's allow aAbBcC vhosts
2013-11-29 09:12:03	nate	he's technically right, by all intents the majority of IRC things are implied to be case insensitive with exception of things like modes mainly, hostmasks should not be treated as case sensitive since a FQDN by all intents is not either obviously
2013-11-29 09:12:24	nate	as fun as that would be though to troll facebook from FACEBOOK.COM

2013-11-29 09:13:47	trist4n	dns isnt case sensitive, hostnames feel like they should be in the same boat (to me).

2013-11-29 19:15:32	Sveta	#windows might be useful
2013-11-29 19:16:48	someplace	^ though they'll probably blame cygwin.

2013-11-29 19:19:47	Sveta	mm
2013-11-29 19:20:15	Sveta	if it's a linux emulating thingie odds are there are ways to check using standard commands of some sort
2013-11-29 19:22:50	elwisp	well, its kinda wierd, cuz i installed everything as the user as im running it as
2013-11-29 19:23:33	elwisp	if i fiture this out it would make a nice update on the wiki
2013-11-29 19:28:44	elwisp	was hoping this would be a znc issue and not cygwin cuz that stuff is fucked

2013-12-01 12:29:23	anewuser	I can't reach it or efnet rejects the identification

2013-12-01 12:36:09	KindOne	look for a modtcl folder somewhere in ~/.znc ? that would be my only logical guess

2013-12-01 17:38:12	danny123	i compiled and installed znc on a macbook. things were up and running but my laptop ran out of battery and shutdown
2013-12-01 17:38:30	danny123	i restarted my laptop and found that i couldnt connect to the webadmin
2013-12-01 17:38:40	danny123	do i need to restart znc somewhere in terminal?
2013-12-01 17:59:55	Aracat	znc generally does not restart when the system boots, so probably
2013-12-01 18:02:53	danny123	is there a command?
2013-12-01 18:04:05	Aracat	in a terminal, znc
2013-12-01 18:05:38	danny123	LOL

2013-12-01 18:06:21	danny123	this znc thing is new to me (obviously) as is using terminal

2013-12-01 18:08:42	Aracat	it said something about already running, so maybe. if the webadmin works then probably not
2013-12-01 18:10:24	danny123	it doesnt
2013-12-01 18:10:33	danny123	i guess i should reinstall it then huh

2013-12-03 05:56:24	Gutenberg	Hi, I'm new to znc and I'm having trouble connecting to the server from the client... Seems like the znc is in the channel, but when I try to connect to it using /quote PASS user:mynickservpassword , I get "Invalid Password * Disconnected (Remote host closed socket)."...
2013-12-03 05:58:06	@fred	enter the right password
2013-12-03 06:08:01	Gutenberg	fred: thanks... I tried to connect using the password to the irc-service, not the passw of my znc user... so apparently you use nickserv in the webadmin panel to identify to the irc-network...
2013-12-03 06:08:16	@fred	,)
2013-12-03 06:09:11	Gutenberg	But for some reason my user isn't OP'ed automatically... And I'm the founder of the channel in question... Any idea why? (This isn't on EFnet, btw)
2013-12-03 06:09:36	@fred	check the irc network faq
2013-12-03 06:10:13	@fred	i'm pretty sure you need to add some flags to your account for autoop
2013-12-03 06:10:59	Gutenberg	well, when I didn't use znc, I was autoOpped
2013-12-03 06:11:17	@fred	ok

2013-12-03 07:04:50	Gutenberg	Ok, noob question... I'm on 1.2, and I've added a second network to my user... When I connect to znc, only the first network comes up... 
2013-12-03 07:05:45	Gutenberg	You have to connect to the networks separately from your client?
2013-12-03 07:06:51	@fred	yes
2013-12-03 07:08:27	Gutenberg	well, but can I log into my account while I'm active on another network?
2013-12-03 07:08:51	laj	fred, say
2013-12-03 07:09:00	laj	Would you know how to disable a channel form auto joining?
2013-12-03 07:09:05	laj	If you do, you'll be my bst frend forever
2013-12-03 07:09:18	@fred	hmmm - remove it ?

2013-12-03 07:57:54	laj	Well, it can be entered, it's just empty so the network immediately kicks me when Ie nter

2013-12-05 03:51:26	Sveta	znc supports the time 'message tag' ? what irc clients support it ?
2013-12-05 03:52:47	Sveta	( http://ircv3.org/specification/message-tags-3.2 )
2013-12-05 04:04:21	nate	I would be surprised if any yet since the 3.2 stuff is a 'draft' concept still (I mean ignoring that 3.1 is too technically but it's stable per the IRCv3 group)
2013-12-05 04:15:42	Sveta	fyi i edited http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#I_keep_getting_kicked_for_flood_when_I_...  , added second section

2013-12-05 05:00:49	erratic-	and its not that it doesn't interest me but I lose interest in EVERYTHING really easily
2013-12-05 05:01:39	erratic-	I can't really complain, the world isn't gonna change and I don't mind compromising with taking medication to continue to be a part of it 
2013-12-05 05:02:08	erratic-	what else am I gonna do :) stair at the wall play video games or get drunk. Take acid read conspiracy and troll on 4chan 
2013-12-05 05:02:37	erratic-	take pictures of shit with a really expensive camera that nobody cares about 
2013-12-05 05:02:52	erratic-	spend a bunch of money to go on "vacation" to another country 
2013-12-05 05:03:27	erratic-	I've given up on trying to live life the "right" way, I like programming and working with computers

2013-12-05 17:15:29	elwisp	Anyone hwere with experience of running znc on cygwin?
2013-12-05 17:16:11	KindOne	I run it inside cygwin hell
2013-12-05 17:17:00	asphyx	why cygwin?
2013-12-05 17:18:11	KindOne	I need Windows / too lazy to install some flavor of *nix on some old PC / too cheap to get a VPS
2013-12-05 17:18:46	asphyx	should be easier to install a little debian box than using cywin on windows
2013-12-05 17:19:02	asphyx	i bought a raspberry for such usage
2013-12-05 17:19:06	Sveta	i installed cygwin on other computer today
2013-12-05 17:19:08	Sveta	5 mins
2013-12-05 17:19:17	Sveta	3 of them was d/l the installer
2013-12-05 17:19:18	Sveta	no prob
2013-12-05 17:19:34	elwisp	KindOne: i installed it and everything works fine except that it cannot write the conf to disk
2013-12-05 17:19:46	KindOne	um, what OS?
2013-12-05 17:19:48	Sveta	i remember such problem asked here before...
2013-12-05 17:19:53	elwisp	KindOne: win2008 server
2013-12-05 17:20:51	elwisp	asphyx: actually it was easier installing it on cygwin than on debian. but thing is i dotn have a choice, cuz its for work
2013-12-05 17:20:52	KindOne	mmm let me resume my Win2008r2 vm
2013-12-05 17:21:35	elwisp	KindOne: strange thing is that if i remove the conf... it restarts and writes a new one with out any problems
2013-12-05 17:21:40	asphyx	i also use cygwin at work and i always have trouble
2013-12-05 17:22:28	KindOne	`znc -D` and try to savet the config and see what happens?
2013-12-05 17:22:46	elwisp	Error while replacing the config file with a new version, errno says Permission denied
2013-12-05 17:23:03	elwisp	KindOne: but if i remove it first it will save just fine
2013-12-05 17:24:22	elwisp	humm, maybe its because i installed it to home dir tho
2013-12-05 17:24:55	elwisp	KindOne: how did you install it?
2013-12-05 17:25:56	KindOne	im installing/downloading cygwin on my win2008 vm
2013-12-05 17:26:05	elwisp	KindOne: sweet
2013-12-05 17:26:19	KindOne	im running this znc on WinXP (yes, I know its 2000000 years old)
2013-12-05 17:26:31	elwisp	hehe
2013-12-05 17:27:19	KindOne	just don't load modtcl in cygwin hell, it will crash znc
2013-12-05 17:28:23	KindOne	you got standard or datacenter?
2013-12-05 17:28:36	elwisp	what u mean?
2013-12-05 17:28:46	elwisp	its a vmware server running on some blade stack i think
2013-12-05 17:31:11	KindOne	no, win2008, it standerd or datacenter version, control panel -> system
2013-12-05 17:32:30	KindOne	or is it some other version?
2013-12-05 17:33:01	elwisp	standard
2013-12-05 17:35:58	KindOne	did you just `./configure` or did you add anything else in?
2013-12-05 17:36:22	elwisp	added ssl and homedir
2013-12-05 17:37:00	KindOne	what is `homedir` ?
2013-12-05 17:38:33	elwisp	--prefix
2013-12-05 17:38:44	elwisp	By default, `make install' will install all the files in
2013-12-05 17:38:44	elwisp	`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
2013-12-05 17:38:44	elwisp	an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix',
2013-12-05 17:38:44	elwisp	for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.
2013-12-05 17:41:29	KindOne	so, you only entered `./configure `--prefix=$HOME`
2013-12-05 17:41:40	KindOne	meh, should of got you to `nano config.log` :P
2013-12-05 17:42:11	elwisp	./configure  --prefix=$HOME/znc --with-openssl
2013-12-05 17:42:15	elwisp	thats what i ran
2013-12-05 17:42:26	elwisp	then make && make install
2013-12-05 17:44:17	KindOne	you don't need too --with-openssl, it builds automatically with it if you have openssl-dev installed
2013-12-05 17:44:47	KindOne	wait, are you tarball or git?
2013-12-05 17:44:53	elwisp	tarball
2013-12-05 17:51:25	KindOne	takes forever to compile >.>
2013-12-05 17:54:01	elwisp	hehe yeah
2013-12-05 17:55:24	elwisp	recompiled now an dinstalled to /usr/local/bin/znc with same result

2013-12-05 18:37:36	elwisp	KindOne: any ideas? :)
2013-12-05 18:38:24	KindOne	elwisp, This makes me want to smash Windows.. that's how annoying it is.
2013-12-05 18:38:35	KindOne	I'm trying all sorts of things.
2013-12-05 18:40:09	elwisp	KindOne: ive tried so much that i dont know what to try anymore, is it possible to do some lower level of debugging perhaps. other than znc -D
2013-12-05 18:40:50	KindOne	`znc -D` is all we got as far as I know
2013-12-05 18:41:10	<--	Atlas (atlas@atlas.sx) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-05 18:42:13	elwisp	its possible to run configure with --enable-debug but its unclear what difference it would make
2013-12-05 18:45:04	KindOne	as far as the wiki goes (might be inaccurate) --enable-debug is only useful if you crash it / want to `bt full` it inside of gdb
2013-12-05 18:45:54	elwisp	alright
2013-12-05 18:46:16	elwisp	im pretty sure the problem is cygwin+windows
2013-12-05 18:46:38	elwisp	perhaps something that needs to be included when installing cygwin
2013-12-05 18:50:23	elwisp	KindOne: did you try to remove the conf and do a restart from within znc?
2013-12-05 18:51:03	elwisp	its like if znc was modified to remove the file before writing new one it would work
2013-12-05 18:51:49	KindOne	https://github.com/znc/znc/commit/d16ab96032eda39584240587f7fd802f3c49d839
2013-12-05 18:51:57	KindOne	that in theory was suppose to fix it? but I don't know
2013-12-05 18:54:11	elwisp	hmm
2013-12-05 18:54:17	elwisp	how do i implement that
2013-12-05 18:54:37	KindOne	it was added before 1.2 was released, so its already in it
2013-12-05 18:56:33	elwisp	aha

2013-12-08 02:40:22	Raccoon	psychon: i have 2 suggestions for that module as well
2013-12-08 02:41:02	Raccoon	1) don't report the join errors (banned, invite, key, limit, unavailable, etc) to the client since it gets spammy at the 10 second rejoin rate
2013-12-08 02:41:30	Raccoon	2) include forced part as a rejoin reason.  eg, server sends part but no client issued it
2013-12-08 02:41:39	@psychon	for autocycle? it doesnt join every 10 seconds?!
2013-12-08 02:41:48	Raccoon	no?
2013-12-08 02:41:55	Raccoon	i forget, but it's still spammy.
2013-12-08 02:42:03	@psychon	neither of those really apply to autocycle IMHO
2013-12-08 02:42:08	@psychon	but anyway, not really possible in irc
2013-12-08 02:42:23	@psychon	too many irc messages are meant to be understood by humans, not by programs
2013-12-08 02:42:32	@psychon	any other IRCd invents its own numerics for part reasons :(
2013-12-08 02:42:36	Raccoon	my client script starts rejoining immediately, then after 1 then 2 then 5 and 10 and 30 seconds, then 1 and 2 and 5 and every 10 minutes thereafter.
2013-12-08 02:42:39	@psychon	and forced part isnt standardized either
2013-12-08 02:42:48	@psychon	so both of those would require heuristics
2013-12-08 02:43:09	Raccoon	and i'm sorry, no, not the auto cycle module
2013-12-08 02:43:20	Raccoon	i suppose i'm talking about the rejoin module
2013-12-08 02:43:37	Raccoon	and none of the irc messages are meant to be understood by humans, but by programs.
2013-12-08 02:43:52	Raccoon	it's only politeness that the numerics have a text reason attached to them.
2013-12-08 02:44:15	@psychon	yeah, but still all the IRCds invent their own numerics for lots of corner cases
2013-12-08 02:44:50	@psychon	and znc gives up joining channels after 10 attempts by default, is that still not good enough? :(
2013-12-08 02:44:54	Raccoon	and yes, the forced part heuristics are painfully easy for a proxy like ZNC since it monitors traffic from both directions.  If it receives a part from the server, but never received a part from the client, it should tell the server to piss-off and rejoin.
2013-12-08 02:45:05	Raccoon	i have all the corner cases if you want them.
2013-12-08 02:45:14	Raccoon	including SSL Only
2013-12-08 02:45:39	Raccoon	but really all the standardized cases are the ones that affect people 99.999999999999827% of the time.
2013-12-08 02:45:46	@psychon	that's true
2013-12-08 02:45:47	Raccoon	banned, invite only.
2013-12-08 02:46:12	Raccoon	they don't need to be sent to the client
2013-12-08 02:46:16	@psychon	and counting PARTs doesnt really work since stuff sent by modules cant be monitored currently
2013-12-08 02:46:30	Raccoon	hmm
2013-12-08 02:46:37	Raccoon	which modules would send a part
2013-12-08 02:46:39	@psychon	if you were to properly handle banned and invite only, that could just be used to disable the channel
2013-12-08 02:46:47	@psychon	since there is no point in contiuing to try to rejoin
2013-12-08 02:46:55	@psychon	and I guess that could be done as a module...
2013-12-08 02:46:56	Raccoon	no
2013-12-08 02:47:06	@psychon	eg autocycle would :P
2013-12-08 02:47:07	Raccoon	you keep hammering until the ban or invite to lifts
2013-12-08 02:47:14	Raccoon	that's usually why people use it
2013-12-08 02:47:22	Raccoon	but there's no reason to forward the error message onto the client
2013-12-08 02:47:28	@psychon	znc gives up after 10 attempts currently, unless you configure something else
2013-12-08 02:47:36	Raccoon	i think mine is set to 9999
2013-12-08 02:47:46	@psychon	the idea, I guess, is to work in case of netsplits were channels are temporarily forbidden
2013-12-08 02:48:06	@psychon	0 disables that limit btw
2013-12-08 02:48:12	Raccoon	:)
2013-12-08 02:48:18	Raccoon	anyway, just 2 suggestions.
2013-12-08 02:48:59	Raccoon	i'd include the 3rd suggestion of changing the rejoin hammer delay to a logarithmicesque scale
2013-12-08 02:50:59	@psychon	that doesnt sound totally unreasonable
2013-12-08 02:51:15	@psychon	perhaps I'd go with something polynomial instead of exponential, but that's bike shedding
2013-12-08 02:51:23	Raccoon	btw, question about the nick retention module
2013-12-08 02:51:32	@psychon	anyway, I do have +o in here, but I don't think I actually did much for znc this year, so I am the wrong person to convince
2013-12-08 02:51:36	Raccoon	why doesn't it allow the client to change his/her nickname manually?
2013-12-08 02:52:37	--	Raccoon is now known as Raccy
2013-12-08 02:52:40	--	Raccy is now known as Raccoon
2013-12-08 02:52:47	Raccoon	er nvm, maybe that was something old
2013-12-08 02:52:51	@psychon	uhm, it should allow it
2013-12-08 02:53:01	@psychon	however, it does block nick changes to the nick that the module is trying to get
2013-12-08 02:53:04	Raccoon	oh i know what i wanted to ask
2013-12-08 02:53:18	@psychon	and that's needed since znc blocks the 433 numerics that the module causes
2013-12-08 02:53:39	Raccoon	when the client is trying to get a nick, it seems to be doing so inefficiently
2013-12-08 02:53:46	Raccoon	it hammers the server every N duration right?
2013-12-08 02:54:59	@psychon	"the client"? hm? do you mean the keepnick module?
2013-12-08 02:55:07	Raccoon	keepnick yes
2013-12-08 02:55:37	Raccoon	when my ghost pings off, it's usually several seconds until znc reclaims the nick
2013-12-08 02:55:45	Raccoon	by that time another bot sometimes takes it
2013-12-08 02:56:14	@psychon	the keepnick module tries every 30 seconds or when it sees someone else using your nick /quit or /nick to something else
2013-12-08 02:56:25	Raccoon	I would recommend instead that it uses WATCH or MONITOR to determine when the nick is immediately available, on servers that support WATCH or MONITOR.
2013-12-08 02:56:43	@psychon	patches welcome (but I am too lazy to review them, sorry)
2013-12-08 02:56:44	Raccoon	You could in theory also use ISON but that requires hammering like NICK
2013-12-08 02:56:58	@psychon	yeah, ISON wouldnt be better than NICK
2013-12-08 02:57:15	Raccoon	but either WATCH and MONITOR are supported on most networks and ircds
2013-12-08 02:57:25	Raccoon	(MONITOR is technically superior)
2013-12-08 02:57:52	Raccoon	that gets you up to the second notification
2013-12-08 02:58:01	@psychon	true
2013-12-08 02:59:15	Raccoon	think I'll pester KindOne to code it :)

2013-12-08 03:01:54	Raccoon	damn
2013-12-08 03:02:07	@psychon	mostly because I am afraid of modules causing endless loops between each other
2013-12-08 03:02:08	Raccoon	even if PART were rebound to something else perhaps?

2013-12-08 08:34:56	Sveta	Ah. I might write a module which does that actually, buffextras module is sort of readable...
2013-12-08 08:37:53	kylef	Sveta: you do realise this would confuse your client and cause the nickname list to be incorrect?
2013-12-08 08:38:54	kylef	it could even cause crashes in some bad clients if a nick part's that isn't in the channel currently
2013-12-08 08:39:02	Sveta	you mean because it gets /names first, and only then receives the join/quit/etc events?
2013-12-08 08:39:07	Sveta	mmm
2013-12-08 08:39:24	kylef	yes
2013-12-08 08:39:39	kylef	it could receive KICK/QUIT/PART events for a nick that isn't even in the channel
2013-12-08 08:39:46	kylef	it could also receive a JOIN for a nick already in a channel
2013-12-08 08:40:36	Sveta	use fake=1 message tag? :)
2013-12-08 08:41:11	Sveta	although parsing that is no easier than parsing buffextras messages and displaying them properly
2013-12-08 08:41:30	Sveta	ie displaying as native lines without sending these events

2013-12-09 01:20:40	Gutenberg	Hi... When I try to make any changes to my users through the webadmin, I get "invalid user settings"... Any idea what might cause this?
2013-12-09 01:24:33	SilverLeo	Gutenberg: which version of znc? try making the change with the *admin module
2013-12-09 01:24:49	Gutenberg	SilverLeo: I'm on 1.2
2013-12-09 01:25:11	Gutenberg	You mean the controlpanel module?
2013-12-09 01:26:09	SilverLeo	yea
2013-12-09 01:27:00	Gutenberg	Ok, for instance I'm trying to turn the bufferextra-module off

2013-12-09 01:28:12	SilverLeo	you can unloadmodule with *status

2013-12-09 01:29:16	Gutenberg	seems to have worked
2013-12-09 01:29:23	Gutenberg	but still I'm kind of puzzled

2013-12-10 14:40:40	eric_	Anyone got the fish module working with 1.2? I compiled it with znc-buildmod. Tried placing it in ~/.znc/modules
2013-12-10 14:40:47	eric_	Does not show up after restarting ZNC tho.
2013-12-10 14:41:15	eric_	Tried placing it in /usr/local/lib/znc/
2013-12-10 14:41:18	eric_	No luck

2013-12-10 15:19:59	eric_	yeap, not there in the list
2013-12-10 15:20:23	KindOne	look for the "Edit" button and click it for the network
2013-12-10 15:20:47	KindOne	that page is for `user` modules, fish is a `network` module, so you need to select the specific network to load it in
2013-12-10 15:20:48	eric_	not there either
2013-12-10 15:21:39	KindOne	I just compiled and put it in ~/.znc/modules/ and its showing up in the webadmin
2013-12-10 15:21:55	eric_	hm

2013-12-10 15:22:26	eric_	this one right http://pastebin.com/NDVtfcVG
2013-12-10 15:23:01	KindOne	Yes. the other one won't compile in 1.0+
2013-12-10 15:23:11	eric_	Building "fish.so" for ZNC 1.2... [ ok ]
2013-12-10 15:23:19	eric_	ok, copying i

2013-12-11 18:05:01	Svetlana	Hi. I'm thinking about the use-case when user turned off playback of buffer which was already read. The problem is that ZNC assumes that when client is attached, messages are read - while on crappy wifi that may fail to be true (message is sent and assumed to be read, but client is already in the process of timing out).
2013-12-11 18:05:14	Svetlana	Messages are lost.
2013-12-11 18:05:32	Svetlana	In such use-case (keepbuffer false, crappy wifi) would you acknowledge such problem?
2013-12-11 18:07:02	Svetlana	If so would it be possible to work around that by having the client send ZNC the last timestamp (from the server-time message tag) which it saw, each time it connects?

2013-12-11 18:30:50	@SilverLeo	Svetlana: how about: http://wiki.znc.in/Clearbufferonmsg
2013-12-11 18:31:15	Svetlana	I often connect to read without chatting
2013-12-11 18:31:39	Svetlana	the workaround I mentioned could of be a neat solution in my view
2013-12-11 18:32:29	@SilverLeo	yes, one could make a new CAP to give znc a timestamp where it should begin the buffer playback
2013-12-11 18:32:44	@SilverLeo	that would also require the support on the client
2013-12-11 18:35:16	Svetlana	yea I would script that in few clients if znc were to support that

2013-12-13 20:40:33	TooCool	I got a newbie type question, because I have never done a znc.  Would these specs be OK for a znc with approximately 400 users on the znc?
2013-12-13 20:41:12	TooCool	4x vCPU - 2048MB RAM - 500 GB SATA - Debian 7 64bit - DDOS protected IP addresses - 4000 GB Included Bandwidth.
2013-12-13 20:42:02	TooCool	It would be a VPS instead of an actual dedicated server donated by the ISP.
2013-12-13 20:44:53	@SilverLeo	4x vCPU sounds overkill
2013-12-13 20:46:46	@SilverLeo	for 400 users you'll have to get enough ip addresses or setup some I-lines or similar with the networks

2013-12-13 21:01:17	TooCool	I am guessing it would use like 512 megs of RAM, although I am only guessing.  I have not tried it yet.

2013-12-15 03:40:05	arvenius	helloes
2013-12-15 03:40:28	arvenius	after upgrading my znc on my debian from 1.2-1 to 1.2-2 the binary seems to have gone
2013-12-15 03:40:32	arvenius	any ideas?
2013-12-15 03:40:40	arvenius	it sais the pakage is installed correctly
2013-12-15 03:44:11	arvenius	well im compiling from source right now
2013-12-15 03:45:56	@psychon	the-me: ^
2013-12-15 03:46:09	@psychon	also, what exactly does "the binary seems to have gone" mean?
2013-12-15 03:46:25	arvenius	it means there is no 'znc' i could start anymore
2013-12-15 03:46:52	@psychon	and does apt-cache policy znc really say that it is installed?
2013-12-15 03:47:55	arvenius	znc:

2013-12-15 03:48:48	@psychon	sieht besser aus als mein "Installiert: (keine)" :-P
2013-12-15 03:48:50	@psychon	well, ok
2013-12-15 03:48:56	@psychon	dpkg -L znc | grep bin
2013-12-15 03:49:12	arvenius	nix
2013-12-15 03:49:58	@psychon	seems like the-me broke the package badly
2013-12-15 03:50:06	@psychon	which means you should report a bug
2013-12-15 03:50:17	arvenius	seems also the modules are gone
2013-12-15 03:50:30	arvenius	i jsut copied the manual compiled znc bin to /bin
2013-12-15 03:50:40	arvenius	then: [ ?? ] Do you really want to run ZNC without any modules? (yes/no) [no]:
2013-12-15 03:51:11	@psychon	well, there are some modules: http://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/znc/filelist
2013-12-15 03:51:26	@psychon	but if you just did ./configure, znc is looking for them in /usr/local/lib/znc, not /usr/lib/znc
2013-12-15 03:52:18	arvenius	ah ok
2013-12-15 03:52:29	arvenius	yes the .so files seem to be there
2013-12-15 03:52:43	arvenius	how can i tell ./configure to look in the correct place?
2013-12-15 03:53:33	@psychon	debian uses --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib --enable-tcl --enable-cyrus --enable-perl --enable-python
2013-12-15 03:57:37	arvenius	now its complaining about missing python3.pc
2013-12-15 03:57:47	arvenius	although im pretty sure python is installed and was working before
2013-12-15 03:57:53	arvenius	maybe i need some dev pakage
2013-12-15 03:58:44	@psychon	then get rid of --enable-perl and --enable-python
2013-12-15 03:58:51	@psychon	you dont really need them if you have the modules already installed
2013-12-15 03:59:08	MrMatej	Hi how to I update my bnc version?
2013-12-15 03:59:24	MrMatej	To 1.2?
2013-12-15 04:00:25	@psychon	how did you get your current version?
2013-12-15 04:00:53	MrMatej	I used -c znc that's all
2013-12-15 04:00:55	MrMatej	:P
2013-12-15 04:02:48	arvenius	what kind of command should -c be?
2013-12-15 04:02:54	arvenius	what system are you on?
2013-12-15 04:06:00	arvenius	ok i got it working again
2013-12-15 04:06:15	arvenius	but i had to do a "make install" since some modules obviously were still missing
2013-12-15 04:06:38	arvenius	i hope this doesnt fux0r with apt when a new (fixed) pakage comes
2013-12-15 04:07:14	@psychon	will you open a bug report?
2013-12-15 04:07:33	arvenius	i have never done so and not really an idea how
2013-12-15 04:07:40	arvenius	but i want to help fix it, sure
2013-12-15 04:07:43	@psychon	apt-get install reportbug
2013-12-15 04:07:58	@psychon	reportbug znc
2013-12-15 04:08:25	@psychon	hm, or just "reportbug", I am not sure

2013-12-15 04:09:27	arvenius	Your version of znc (1.2-2) is newer than that in Debian! Do you still want to file a report [y|N|q|?]?
2013-12-15 04:09:28	arvenius	lol
2013-12-15 04:09:30	arvenius	but ok
2013-12-15 04:10:06	@psychon	1.2-2 is in debian unstable
2013-12-15 04:10:16	arvenius	ah ok
2013-12-15 04:10:20	@psychon	and was uploaded only two days ago
2013-12-15 04:10:39	@psychon	so you likely are the first one to notice
2013-12-15 04:15:01	arvenius	Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.

2013-12-15 04:15:09	arvenius	thx debian for ponting that out.
2013-12-15 04:15:21	td	you dont got enough editors installed
2013-12-15 04:15:32	arvenius	quite sure i have vim
2013-12-15 04:15:36	arvenius	not .tiny
2013-12-15 04:15:39	arvenius	but oh well
2013-12-15 04:15:57	 *	psychon can only use nano and vim from that list
2013-12-15 04:16:03	@psychon	or rather: "has used before"
2013-12-15 04:23:47	arvenius	i have no idea why i have all those editors on my server
2013-12-15 04:24:00	arvenius	maybe dependencies or my co-sysop went nuts ;P
2013-12-15 04:24:10	arvenius	also, bug report filed
2013-12-15 04:24:20	arvenius	i hope its a real one and not a stupid fault on my side
2013-12-15 04:25:12	@psychon	I think it's a real one, too
2013-12-15 04:25:25	@psychon	and since the-me didnt respond to my ping yet, filling a bug is a good thing to do
2013-12-15 04:28:36	arvenius	ok
2013-12-15 04:28:48	arvenius	ill stick around for a while to see if he does

2013-12-15 16:26:07	Gryllida	this means that you're either typoing its nickname, or the nickserv module isn't loaded, or you're not reading all messages you get

2013-12-20 03:53:25	Aracat	looks like it's set up to use ssl to me
2013-12-20 03:53:37	clcl	you know if, znc checks for validality auf the ssl-certificates?
2013-12-20 03:53:45	Aracat	no idea
2013-12-20 03:54:10	clcl	yeah, think so as well. i think you can't connect without encryption to port 6697
2013-12-20 03:54:44	clcl	i have to say that znc is a really cool program. it's runing on my wlan-router :)

2013-12-20 17:30:33	l0cal	one question. i added linknet as network and was offline with my client since yesterday. during this time the linknet server got disconnected from znc (dunno why). after reconnect, all channels are set with flag "Disabled" .. But why ? i enabled the mod "chansaver"
2013-12-20 17:31:38	--	Han` is now known as H[A]N
2013-12-20 17:47:53	meingtsla	Possibly because those channels couldn't be joined
2013-12-20 17:48:22	l0cal	well yes. some have +i
2013-12-20 17:48:31	l0cal	but most of them only key
2013-12-20 17:50:24	meingtsla	Huh. As far as I know it should store the key. Unless the key got changed while you weren't around (somehow I doubt this but it's a possibility)
2013-12-20 17:50:29	l0cal	i can deactive the disabled flag and after clicking "save" the channel opens. would be nice if znc can do that automaticly ^^
2013-12-20 17:50:49	meingtsla	So I guess the question is what caused it to become disabled in the first place
2013-12-20 17:50:55	l0cal	nono. the key didnt change
2013-12-20 17:51:22	meingtsla	Maybe it was a split server?  Does linknet do no join on split?
2013-12-20 17:53:07	l0cal	could been a split. but i'm not sure. i was connected yesterday since in the evening. as i connected earlier all channel set do disabled ^^

2013-12-20 17:55:55	l0cal	not that problem. i can connect to webadmin. all see all channel there. i deactive "disabled" and then znc opens the chan because the key is stored.
2013-12-20 17:56:03	l0cal	i*
2013-12-20 17:59:41	l0cal	but you are right. if the server is split the chan is temp maybe not available and than znc probably disable the saved chans

2013-12-21 06:36:24	cl	hi! i already asked, but i'll have to ask again. i'm using the nickserv module. how can i save my nick-password or do i have to send the command "/msg *nickserv ..." everytime i start znc?
2013-12-21 06:36:51	cl	is there an option in znc.comf i can set?
2013-12-21 06:37:23	cl	btw: i'm using ZNC 0.206 
2013-12-21 06:41:19	@SilverLeo	you msg *nickserv once and it'll save the password
2013-12-21 06:41:31	@SilverLeo	and you should really upgrade, 0.206 is quite old
2013-12-21 06:46:05	cl	SilverLeo: hmm ... this doesn't work unfortunately. saving i mean
2013-12-21 06:46:36	cl	and i can't upgrade easily, cause znc is running on my wlan-router (openwrt firmware)
2013-12-21 06:47:17	cl	i have a look again, but i think the package i'm using is the newest i can get for my router.

2013-12-23 11:05:56	WildSoft	Hello =) Was hoping someone could help me. I am using znc-msvc (Windows) and yesterday all of a sudden the bouncer flipped out and is running like syrup and route_replies module spamming errors and one client can't connect to a specific network any more. Takes 2 mins just to access the webinterface. Tried to change port in case it was some sort of DDOS attack because the server runs fine...
2013-12-23 11:05:56	WildSoft	...otherwise.
2013-12-23 11:08:24	WildSoft	And I do not run the FiSH module (is a warning about that on znc-msvc homepage) they say is vulnerable to DDOS attacks
2013-12-23 11:14:36	--	blackwind is now known as bw
2013-12-23 11:55:14	WildSoft	Found a lead
2013-12-23 11:56:37	WildSoft	Theres a user thats listed 2 servers under "Servers" and when that user tries to connect to a network the whole bouncer shuts down
2013-12-23 11:56:50	WildSoft	:/
2013-12-23 13:38:24	WildSoft	Now I've tried everything. ZNC hangs or runs very, very, very slow if any user tries to connect to any gamesurge server
2013-12-23 13:38:29	WildSoft	is this just happening for me?

2013-12-23 16:59:08	@psychon	WildSoft: if you want me to guess: your dns resolver has problems / replies slowly (at least to queries for gamesurge servers)
2013-12-23 16:59:27	@psychon	and since znc-msvc blocks waiting for dns replies, things go downhill
2013-12-23 16:59:39	WildSoft	Thanks you for the answer =)
2013-12-23 16:59:55	WildSoft	So, you think it's the ISP that has problems?
2013-12-23 17:00:36	@psychon	dunno
2013-12-23 17:00:46	@psychon	you could open a terminal and try to connect to gamesurge via telnet
2013-12-23 17:00:56	@psychon	telnet some.server.address 6667
2013-12-23 17:01:08	WildSoft	strange thing is I have no problems connecting with an IRC client
2013-12-23 17:01:25	WildSoft	using the DNS address
2013-12-23 17:01:27	@psychon	from the same computer?
2013-12-23 17:01:30	WildSoft	yes
2013-12-23 17:01:46	WildSoft	same computer, also tried flushing the DNS
2013-12-23 17:03:01	WildSoft	But still, it has worked like a charm for months then just all of a sudden goes bananas and the problem being one client using a DNS address (normal IP to gamesurge works just fine) and DNS works through a IRC client
2013-12-23 17:03:39	WildSoft	Tried making a new client, no modules and a gamesurge address boom failure
2013-12-23 17:05:06	WildSoft	Using the Windows version of ZNC (znc-msvc) I got suggested that it might be because I'm using pre 1.0 and it tries to resolve the DNS as an IPv6 address

2013-12-23 20:19:35	KindOne	... and that was fixed in 1.0, so you don't need to do that setbindhost 0.0.0.0 stuff
2013-12-23 20:19:51	Kaa	okay. I'm doing that right now, then.
2013-12-23 20:20:23	Kaa	I got znc from the Ubuntu repos. I'll pull the last stable version from git, then.

2013-12-29 04:54:44	XRD	I've installed znc 1.2 and the webadmin module loads but says files are missing. For instance, clicking any link on the webadmin page returns a 404. Any idea how to fix this?
2013-12-29 04:59:18	@SilverLeo	sounds like you didn't install it properly or you're running it from the source dir without telling znc you want that
2013-12-29 04:59:47	XRD	More likely the latter
2013-12-29 05:00:11	@SilverLeo	the latter imples the former actually..
2013-12-29 05:00:14	@SilverLeo	implies*
2013-12-29 05:00:27	XRD	running it from the source dir, that :P
2013-12-29 05:00:40	@SilverLeo	right. which means you didn't install it
2013-12-29 05:01:12	XRD	I did make install and it went into /usr/local/share supposedly
2013-12-29 05:01:20	XRD	After running the config and make
2013-12-29 05:05:32	@SilverLeo	so then you cd out of the install dir and run "znc" ?
2013-12-29 05:06:07	XRD	yes, and it loaded my old config file with the irc server and user configs and everything else loaded up just fine
2013-12-29 05:07:24	@SilverLeo	did you do something special to get the webadmin module?
2013-12-29 05:07:38	@SilverLeo	you can run znc with --debug to see the paths where it's trying to load the files from
2013-12-29 05:11:35	XRD	ok so when I do make install, it says znc was successfully installed, you can use '/uxr/local/bin/znc --makeconf' to generate a config file. When I cd out and run znc, it still tries to run an older version
2013-12-29 05:11:42	XRD	usr/local*
2013-12-29 05:15:31	XRD	when running /usr/local/bin/znc, it reads my old config until "Unable to find modinfo [antiidle] - Unrecoverable config error
2013-12-29 05:15:33	XRD	then quits
2013-12-29 05:16:48	tomaw	so you now have two versions installed. 'which znc' will tell you where the old one is.
2013-12-29 05:17:38	XRD	it says /usr/local/bin/znc, same as where 1.2 supposedly went
2013-12-29 05:17:45	XRD	Running znc -v shows 1.2
2013-12-29 05:17:51	XRD	er

2013-12-30 06:37:12	n00b403	Hello.
2013-12-30 06:37:41	n00b403	I have a question about running znc on a Synology Diskstation...
2013-12-30 06:38:22	n00b403	If I have a ddns hostname configured for use on the DS, will it reflect in the connection to IRC servers? 
2013-12-30 06:39:14	@psychon	ddns? as in "dynamic dns"? nope
2013-12-30 06:40:45	n00b403	Yeah. Is there a possibility to make that work? (In other words, having a chose hostname displayed rather than the host's IP address.)
2013-12-30 06:41:44	@psychon	nope
2013-12-30 06:41:55	n00b403	Aaw.
2013-12-30 06:42:00	@psychon	want the technical details or is a "nope" enough?
2013-12-30 06:42:12	n00b403	yeah I was gonna ask, why not? :)
2013-12-30 06:42:34	@psychon	when you connect to an irc server, all the irc server sees is the ip address that the connection comes from, thus no host names at all
2013-12-30 06:42:44	@psychon	the irc server now asks dns for the PTR record for the ip
2013-12-30 06:42:46	@psychon	!dns 109.234.106.54
2013-12-30 06:42:50	@psychon	hm, the bot is gone
2013-12-30 06:43:10	@psychon	"reverse dns lookup" is something to google for
2013-12-30 06:43:35	n00b403	I see. The ddns service is more of a one-way thing then, right?
2013-12-30 06:43:43	@psychon	anyway, http://remote.12dt.com/ says that the ip above resolves to psybnc.out.znc.in
2013-12-30 06:44:03	@psychon	next, the IRC resolves that domain back to an ip address (psybnc.out.znc.in resolves to 109.234.106.54)
2013-12-30 06:44:14	@psychon	if this is the same ip address that the connection comes from, it uses the host name
2013-12-30 06:44:26	@psychon	else (or if any of the dns lookups fail), it uses the ip address
2013-12-30 06:44:34	n00b403	Aha.
2013-12-30 06:44:48	@psychon	now "who controls the pointer record of your IP address"?
2013-12-30 06:45:07	n00b403	That would be my ISP I suppose.
2013-12-30 06:45:09	@psychon	since you are connecting from 195-240-3-1.ip.telfort.nl, apparently telfort is a company and that company controls the PTR records
2013-12-30 06:45:12	@psychon	yeah
2013-12-30 06:45:44	@psychon	so anything with a dynamic ip address cant work for own reverse lookups

2013-12-30 06:47:54	n00b403	The diskstation actually has a static IP from the ISP. I use a few of those free ddns services to have a easy-to-remember hostname forward to the IP address, because I often access the server via www.
2013-12-30 06:48:23	@psychon	then: I dont know any ISP which let's you control PTR records
2013-12-30 06:48:40	n00b403	And I remember from before some ppl on IRC used to have custom made hostnames, probably by renting shell accounts. But I was wondering if anything like that was possible this way.

2013-12-31 06:15:00	WiZaRDuSS	hey, I'm having trouble setting up awaystore, I was curious if someone could help me out
2013-12-31 06:17:22	@SilverLeo	what kind of trouble?
2013-12-31 06:19:22	WiZaRDuSS	when I try to add the variables for a server like [ -timer 3600 ] password
2013-12-31 06:19:47	WiZaRDuSS	*I get a message from awaystore telling me it's unable to decrypt the messages
2013-12-31 06:20:18	WiZaRDuSS	when I try to use any command there, *status tells me that there's "no such module [awaystore]"
2013-12-31 06:21:50	WiZaRDuSS	so right now I'm not sure how to set it up or how to request the messages I've missed
2013-12-31 06:23:44	@SilverLeo	if you give awaystore the wrong password it'll unload itself
2013-12-31 06:23:47	<--	bfortifie (~bfortifie@198.233.47.229) has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)

2013-12-31 06:24:14	WiZaRDuSS	as soon as I try to set it in the webadmin I get that message
2013-12-31 06:25:07	@SilverLeo	so what happens when you /msg *status loadmod awaystore -timer 3600 password
2013-12-31 06:25:18	@SilverLeo	with the correct pass
2013-12-31 06:25:20	-->	bfortifie (~bfortifie@198.233.47.229) has joined #znc
2013-12-31 06:26:19	WiZaRDuSS	Module [awaystore] aborted: Failed to decrypt your saved messages - Did you give the right encryption key as an argument to this module?
2013-12-31 06:26:25	WiZaRDuSS	I'm positive I used the right password though
2013-12-31 06:27:21	@SilverLeo	so does it work without the timer?
2013-12-31 06:28:26	WiZaRDuSS	notimer gives the same message
2013-12-31 06:28:51	@SilverLeo	did you have the module loaded before?
2013-12-31 06:29:09	WiZaRDuSS	not that I know of
2013-12-31 06:29:33	WiZaRDuSS	is there a way to reset it somehow?
2013-12-31 06:30:04	@SilverLeo	yes, you'll have to delete the saved data. which version of znc are you on?
2013-12-31 06:30:29	WiZaRDuSS	1.3-git-23-9e0597f I'm using freeBNC
2013-12-31 06:32:33	@SilverLeo	so the data is saved in ~/.znc/users/[user]/networks/[network]/moddata/awaystore/.registry
2013-12-31 06:33:09	WiZaRDuSS	that's on the server? since I'm using freebnc I wont be able to access that..
2013-12-31 06:34:51	@SilverLeo	hmm, sounds like you're out of luck on that module then..
2013-12-31 06:35:01	@SilverLeo	why do you think you need it anyway?
2013-12-31 06:35:33	WiZaRDuSS	I thought it was the only way to get the highlights that people have sent me while I wasn't connected to the server through a client
2013-12-31 06:37:24	@SilverLeo	if you really mean highlights(messages on a channel) then check the watch module. awaystore has nothing to do with those
2013-12-31 06:37:56	@SilverLeo	if you mean private messages then znc will deliver them to you when you connect with a client
2013-12-31 06:38:13	WiZaRDuSS	ah ok, I'm new to znc, and I was trying to figure out what to use. with the description on the wiki I thought awaystore did that
2013-12-31 06:38:21	WiZaRDuSS	but then I guess I'm going to need the watch module
2013-12-31 06:40:22	WiZaRDuSS	is it also possible to set watch to any highlights instead of just from a specific user?
2013-12-31 06:42:00	@SilverLeo	you mean like the second example on the wiki page?
2013-12-31 06:42:25	WiZaRDuSS	I think so, though im not sure what the %nick% does
2013-12-31 06:42:36	@SilverLeo	it matches your own nick
2013-12-31 06:42:42	@SilverLeo	in a message
2013-12-31 06:43:09	WiZaRDuSS	ok :) so the second example will watch all highlights?
2013-12-31 06:48:04	WiZaRDuSS	seems to work :) and as it's private messaging, I should receive the messages when I log back on
2013-12-31 06:48:07	WiZaRDuSS	thanks SilverLeo :)

2013-12-31 17:20:54	@d4n13L	i think thats more like a client setting. every irc client out there should have such a function
2013-12-31 17:22:52	WiZaRDuSS	yeah, it was. Thanks for pointing out what should've been obvious xD

2013-12-31 17:31:15	kilty66	morning - i am trying to work out how to increase the length of the znc log - can anybody help please?
2013-12-31 17:31:53	WiZaRDuSS	kilty66: if you mean per channel I can help you out :P
2013-12-31 17:33:54	kilty66	i apologise - i do not know the correct terminology
2013-12-31 17:33:58	kilty66	i think that is it
2013-12-31 17:34:12	kilty66	sometimes i do not login for a few days
2013-12-31 17:34:37	kilty66	but it appears within channels only the last few hours of conversation
2013-12-31 17:34:49	WiZaRDuSS	in the web admin panel, if you scroll down, you see buffer size
2013-12-31 17:35:06	WiZaRDuSS	that's the amount of lines it will save for newly added channels
2013-12-31 17:35:13	kilty66	ok
2013-12-31 17:35:16	WiZaRDuSS	for current channels however you'll have to do it manually
2013-12-31 17:35:20	kilty66	i will login just now
2013-12-31 17:35:32	kilty66	how ?
2013-12-31 17:35:42	WiZaRDuSS	by editing the server, then editing the channel and changing the buffercount there
2013-12-31 17:35:49	WiZaRDuSS	which you'll have to repeat for every channel
2013-12-31 17:37:07	@d4n13L	or just do /znc setbuffer * 100
2013-12-31 17:37:10	@d4n13L	or whatever you want to set
2013-12-31 17:37:16	kilty66	ok
2013-12-31 17:37:25	WiZaRDuSS	ok, that I did not know about xD
2013-12-31 17:37:28	@d4n13L	in order to set it for all channels
2013-12-31 17:37:34	kilty66	cheers
2013-12-31 17:37:37	WiZaRDuSS	would be easier to do that
2013-12-31 17:37:39	kilty66	much appreciated
2013-12-31 17:37:40	kilty66	:)
2013-12-31 17:37:55	kilty66	thanks for you help guys
2013-12-31 17:37:59	kilty66	*your
2013-12-31 17:38:17	kilty66	what u normally set yours at?
2013-12-31 17:38:50	@d4n13L	depends on the channel and activity
2013-12-31 17:39:29	@d4n13L	i dont think there is a recommended value ;-)
2013-12-31 17:39:55	kilty66	true - i suppose it depends on how often you open up irc
2013-12-31 17:40:00	kilty66	and the activity
2013-12-31 17:40:03	kilty66	doh

2014-01-03 04:48:29	davek	Hello everyone, just wondering is there any way to get sipe-plugin to run with ZNC
2014-01-03 04:50:33	@psychon	google tells me "This project develops third-party plugins for the Pidgin / Adium / Miranda / Telepathy multi-protocol instant messaging clients/frameworks."
2014-01-03 04:50:41	@psychon	which tells me "wtf is sipe-plugin?"
2014-01-03 04:51:15	davek	lol it's for connect pidgin to Microsoft OCS/Lync servers
2014-01-03 04:52:39	@psychon	then I dont know
2014-01-03 04:53:32	davek	both adium and pidgin interface with the sipe-plugin
2014-01-03 04:53:56	davek	I was wondering could I write something to couple znc and the plugin
2014-01-03 04:56:15	someplace	do you mean.. connecting znc to a lync server?
2014-01-03 04:58:10	davek	yeah
2014-01-03 04:58:31	davek	so getting znc to support more than just IRC servers

2014-01-03 05:15:36	someplace	znc is pretty much locked to IRC
2014-01-03 05:15:39	someplace	it's an IRC bouncer
2014-01-03 05:15:52	someplace	pidgin is a multi-protocol client by nature
2014-01-03 05:19:14	Jerry	Hi there, I'm having an issue where ZNC won't connect to any IRC server. When I do /znc jump, I only get a message saying "Connecting...", but it never actually connects to the server. I've confirmed both my bind host and the IRC server hostname to be correct, and I can connect to IRC servers through other programs. The connection I'm using right now is actually from the ZNC instance that has this 
2014-01-03 05:19:14	Jerry	problem, and I fear that it won't reconnect if I do a /znc jump. I'm running ZNC 1.0; is that a known bug that's fixed in 1.2 or is there anything I can do to address this problem?

2014-01-03 05:20:31	@psychon	does adding a server by ip instead of hostname help? do you have many other users/networks on the same znc instance?
2014-01-03 05:22:00	Jerry	I tried connecting by IP address, but that didn't work either. There are 10 users with 25 networks on that ZNC instance
2014-01-03 05:24:48	@psychon	and this happens for all of them?
2014-01-03 05:27:41	Jerry	I've had tree users report this problem to me, and all of them were trying to connect to Freenode. But I've tried connecting to other networks (EFNet and QuakeNet, that is) as well, and the same thing happened. For what it's worth, my user on this ZNC instance has another network that is currently connected to Freenode, and it seems to be working just fine
2014-01-03 05:28:34	@psychon	no idea, sorry
2014-01-03 05:41:49	Jerry	Shouldn't there be some calls to socket() and/or connect() when I attach strace to ZNC and issue a /znc jump? I can see it's writing to log files and frequently calling poll(), but I can't see anything that would suggest it's trying to connect to a server
2014-01-03 05:43:23	@psychon	on /znc jump, your irc network is just inserted into a list of pending connections
2014-01-03 05:43:44	@psychon	every ConnectDelay (that's a config option) seconds a timer runs, takes the first entry from that list and makes it actually connect
2014-01-03 05:44:03	@psychon	(after checking some more side connections, e.g. the ServerThrottle option etc)
2014-01-03 05:44:21	@psychon	I dont think I ever heard about any bugs in this code that would cause no connects at all

2014-01-12 05:22:41	@SilverLeo	sure. just don't skip to the next line while you're reading stuff
2014-01-12 05:23:06	n00b279	..
2014-01-12 05:27:57	n00b279	Nvm, figured it out.
2014-01-12 05:28:32	@SilverLeo	cool. if you have any other generic questions we have plenty of generic answers
2014-01-12 05:29:04	n00b279	Yeah.. you personally have a lot of generic answers.
2014-01-12 05:30:07	@SilverLeo	indeed, generic answers are easy. if you had asked something znc specific then this channel would be more likely to give better answers
2014-01-12 05:31:44	n00b279	If it wasn't ZNC specific I wouldn't come to the ZNC channel. You see?
2014-01-12 05:32:46	@SilverLeo	reading a file line by line sounds like a very basic c++ question

2014-01-12 07:31:30	@flakes	well, skype is going to shut down the API
2014-01-12 07:31:46	Skyper	i have found it frustrating not getting those messages while sitting on skype
2014-01-12 07:32:21	Skyper	Sadly yes.  but it should take them a few years to prevent the old working version from connecting
2014-01-12 07:33:42	@flakes	well I could add that, it's not a big deal code-wise, but I'd have to also compile it which means setting up a lot of tools beforehand
2014-01-12 07:33:48	@flakes	so chances are it's not going to happen

2014-01-12 07:35:04	Skyper	perhaps you could put the code up and I'll see if I can ever get it compiled?

2014-01-12 08:10:42	Skyper2	Where at if I may ask? The stuff on google code doesn't seem to have changed.

2014-01-12 08:13:50	Skyper2	Unless what I asked is not the code that is up?
2014-01-12 08:14:40	@flakes	basically you can just look up the OnJoin and OnPart ..... events, add them to modskype.cpp and call SendIRCMsgToSkype ...
2014-01-12 08:15:48	Skyper2	Oh
2014-01-12 08:16:28	Skyper2	Well, I guess I will have to do that then.
2014-01-12 08:16:51	Skyper2	Just to be clear, is it VS 2005 or 2008 I will need to find, and will Express suffice?
2014-01-12 08:19:02	@flakes	2008+ express should be okay

2014-01-13 13:21:59	Skyper2	I wish I found SkypeKit before they killed it. Wanted it for different reasons, like a headless relay bot for a headless linux server.
2014-01-13 13:32:15	Skyper2	Although you bring to mind a good question...do I have to build modskype against the Skype4COM.dll, and if so, how, because I just tried linker and it says the DLL is corrupt or invalid.

2014-01-14 02:47:05	roofie	hello
2014-01-14 02:47:24	roofie	how do i set fish keys for certain channels in znc?
2014-01-14 02:47:39	roofie	when i disconnect and log back in - the channel buffer is all encrypted
2014-01-14 02:47:45	roofie	i'd like the buffer to be de-crypted
2014-01-14 02:48:43	@SilverLeo	roofie: if you already have something to decrypt it in your client, it would be more secure to keep it there
2014-01-14 02:48:55	roofie	ok
2014-01-14 02:49:11	@SilverLeo	usually changing from timestamp prefix to timestamp suffix will fix the decryption in your client for the channel buffer
2014-01-14 02:49:34	roofie	interesting
2014-01-14 02:50:23	niissee	good to know :)
2014-01-14 02:50:23	@SilverLeo	so PrependTimestamp false and AppendTimestamp true
2014-01-14 02:50:26	roofie	all of my znc directories are ecrypted on disk - wouldn't decryption in channel buffer be OK then?
2014-01-14 02:51:47	@SilverLeo	roofie: encypted disk is best when the server is offline
2014-01-14 02:51:55	roofie	oh ok
2014-01-14 02:52:48	@SilverLeo	anybody logging in on your running server with enough privileges can get to your files. this is the case with most disk encryption
2014-01-14 02:52:52	@SilverLeo	it's just the way it is
2014-01-14 02:53:27	roofie	but wouldn't they need the pass phrase to decrypt the files and see logs?
2014-01-14 02:53:54	@SilverLeo	when you login to your server now, do you need the pass phrase to see the files?
2014-01-14 02:54:23	roofie	lemme check :P

2014-01-14 02:54:44	n00b834	Can you make znc set vhost when it identifies? I tried "PRIVMSG hostserv :on" in Perform, but that doesn't work.
2014-01-14 02:55:15	roofie	nope ;/
2014-01-14 02:55:18	@SilverLeo	n00b834: did you identify with nickserv before trying to enable a vhost?
2014-01-14 02:56:00	n00b834	Well I have the nickserv module with a password
2014-01-14 02:56:27	@SilverLeo	the nickserv module wait for nickserv to ask for the pass, perform would execute before that
2014-01-14 02:56:32	@SilverLeo	s/wait/waits/
2014-01-14 02:56:47	n00b834	Right, okay. What would be the workaround?
2014-01-14 02:57:20	@SilverLeo	add identify to perform before the hostserv command
2014-01-14 02:57:45	roofie	SilverLeo: PrependTimestamp is already set to false and AppendTimestamp is alredy set to true in my znc.conf but I'm still seeing encrypted text in the channel buffer
2014-01-14 02:58:03	@SilverLeo	roofie: try setting both to false
2014-01-14 02:58:32	@SilverLeo	it really depends on your client and how it handles the encrypted lines
2014-01-14 02:59:30	roofie	ok
2014-01-14 03:02:16	n00b834	Still doesn't work. It identifies but doesn't activate vhost. If I sendraw PRIVMSG hostserv :on to the server then that works
2014-01-14 03:03:07	@SilverLeo	do you get any reply at all from hostserv?
2014-01-14 03:03:39	n00b834	I'd need to enable the log module to get that, right?
2014-01-14 03:04:23	@SilverLeo	if you have a client connected on the znc user you should see if hostserv replies
2014-01-14 03:08:52	n00b834	Found the root cause, thanks.

2014-01-15 09:02:28	SirCmpwn	whatever the circumstances, you've got to figure it out somehow
2014-01-15 09:02:49	SirCmpwn	convince your friend to give you root and build a newer version from source, or build your own version in a nonstandard prefix
2014-01-15 09:05:35	CalebH_	(it is twily/pcb_master)
2014-01-15 09:06:04	SirCmpwn	also, make sure you trust your friend, because he will have access to anything you do on IRC, including passwords for bots or nickserv or whatever
2014-01-15 09:06:09	CalebH_	Can I get ZNC to do anything good for me without root?
2014-01-15 09:06:23	SirCmpwn	you can't get that version of ZNC to do anything worthwhile

2014-01-15 09:19:51	CalebH_	All I really need is a ZNC. Other than that I want an MC server, but that'll require a great leap in specs.
2014-01-15 09:21:37	CalebH_	Now how will I connect to ZNC?
2014-01-15 09:21:55	SirCmpwn	same way you connect to efnet, except swap out efnet for your server's location
2014-01-15 09:23:26	CalebH_	by... going to znc.net instead of efnet.net?
2014-01-15 09:23:32	CalebH_	XD
2014-01-15 09:23:50	SirCmpwn	yeesh, you're using webchat
2014-01-15 09:23:55	SirCmpwn	start by getting real client
2014-01-15 09:23:57	CalebH_	XD
2014-01-15 09:24:07	CalebH_	Got it; choose to not use it
2014-01-15 09:24:25	CalebH_	So what do I do to the client?
2014-01-15 09:24:46	SirCmpwn	maybe you should spend some time learning the basics of networking and server administration before you try to do networking and server administration
2014-01-15 09:24:49	CalebH_	Should I join from it?

2014-01-15 09:27:29	CalebH_	I'm just trying to figure out how ZNC will keep me online.
2014-01-15 09:27:36	SirCmpwn	ZNC is a bouncer
2014-01-15 09:27:43	SirCmpwn	you connect to it and it connects to IRC on your behalf
2014-01-15 09:27:49	SirCmpwn	when you disconnect, it doesn't.
2014-01-15 09:28:00	CalebH_	ah
2014-01-15 09:28:47	CalebH_	Well, so do you mean I should change irc.servercentral.net to redcalico.zapto.org?
2014-01-15 09:28:56	SirCmpwn	is that where you put your ZNC?
2014-01-15 09:29:00	CalebH_	yes
2014-01-15 09:29:02	SirCmpwn	did you put it on port 6667?
2014-01-15 09:29:09	SirCmpwn	are you using SSL? Have you configured it?

2014-01-15 11:09:20	wowaname	i know it breaks IRC protocol and may well not be implemented
2014-01-15 11:09:34	wowaname	but it seems weird that the ZNC can't take a NAMES i request and update its list
2014-01-15 11:10:03	Resetti	only guess i have is do you have multiple clients attached to that network?
2014-01-15 11:10:25	wowaname	one but not at the moment
2014-01-15 11:10:42	Resetti	doing names is client side i think... not sure..
2014-01-15 11:10:48	wowaname	i'm developing for an IRCd so that's why i'm screwing with this stuff
2014-01-15 11:11:02	wowaname	i can temporarily fix a nameslist until i reconnect to the bouncer
2014-01-15 11:12:06	Resetti	also don't most clients use /who? i know hexchat does..
2014-01-15 11:12:34	wowaname	even though it doesn't really pertain to this, i will answer that
2014-01-15 11:12:36	wowaname	no it does not
2014-01-15 11:12:45	wowaname	it uses WHO if you have check enabled for away
2014-01-15 11:12:52	wowaname	otherwise it uses NAMES
2014-01-15 11:12:54	Kiggy	thank you resetti that works <3
2014-01-15 11:12:57	wowaname	and NAMES is sent on channel join
2014-01-15 11:13:06	wowaname	so it doesn't need to do anything if it's not checking for away
2014-01-15 11:15:05	thommey	mirc uses /who to keep the IAL (internal address list to cache userhosts), eggdrop does as well

2014-01-15 11:15:58	wowaname	i'm on a network that complains on WHO queries over 25 users

2014-01-16 09:54:23	CalebH2	What could be possible problems for general errors?
2014-01-16 09:54:50	CalebH2	Is it a problem that I'm running ZNC 0.9, not 1.2?
2014-01-16 09:55:26	CalebH2	Or could my client be bad?
2014-01-16 09:56:23	CalebH2	Why do I log into something.somethinelse.org in SSH, but somethingelse.org when prefixing it with 'znc'?
2014-01-16 09:56:46	trist4n	why do you
2014-01-16 09:56:49	CalebH2	(As in the web-thing and the IRC client)
2014-01-16 10:04:17	CalebH2	Surely there is a problem here.
2014-01-16 10:04:52	CalebH2	I visit - I'll need to say it - redcalico.zapto.org, and it is nothing.
2014-01-16 10:05:17	CalebH2	However zapto.org is, even though it only redirects to noip.com.

2014-01-17 11:00:20	Collin	I was wondering if there is a module similar to 'notify_connect' that is configurable to only send the attach/detach messages to configured admins? or eg: Make the module a user module instead of global
2014-01-17 11:19:29	KindOne	asking on freenode and EFnet ... lolz
2014-01-17 11:20:05	Collin	no response on either, is why
2014-01-17 11:24:16	KindOne	so... make notify_connect a usermode and need to be an admin to see the notices and stuff?
2014-01-17 11:24:50	Collin	I can attempt it
2014-01-17 11:25:01	Collin	the last module I tried to make/duplicate crashed the service
2014-01-17 11:25:15	Collin	and there is over 200 active users on it... so Im a bit nervous

2014-01-17 11:57:30	Collin	KindOne, there is no OnLoad function

2014-01-17 16:06:45	drbean	What does the fact I can connect to znc from a different machine, but get a disconnection: 'irc: connection timeout (message 001 not received)'
2014-01-17 16:06:55	drbean	imply.
2014-01-17 16:07:06	trist4n	>ing
2014-01-17 16:07:28	drbean	Connecting to znc from the same machine, there is no timeout and I get the IRC MOTD.
2014-01-17 16:08:24	@SilverLeo	sounds like a firewall
2014-01-17 16:08:57	drbean	This is with systemctl stop firewalld.service, ie firewall off, on both machines.
2014-01-17 16:09:38	@SilverLeo	did you set the allowed ips list in znc+
2014-01-17 16:12:41	drbean	There's nothing in allowed IPs for the user.
2014-01-17 16:14:01	drbean	Another high-port server app, vnc is working from the same machine as znc, so I doubt it is the school network the machine is behind.
2014-01-17 16:14:28	trist4n	have you tried the old "nc on the port and telnet to it" school of network troubleshooting
2014-01-17 16:16:40	@SilverLeo	drbean: are the ssl settings the same on both clients trying to connect?
2014-01-17 16:17:39	drbean	I didn't try nc, but in /server raw in weechat on the other machine I'm connecting from, I see only repeated: "NICK drbean  USER drbean 0 * :drbean  PASS [deleted] "
2014-01-17 16:19:51	Collin	Does anyone know where I can find a mirror site with this module on it? http://wiki.znc.in/Notify
2014-01-17 16:19:56	drbean	On neither machine is the client using ssl.
2014-01-17 16:20:32	drbean	Perhaps I should try using ssl. I can remember that solving a problem before.
2014-01-17 16:20:49	@SilverLeo	drbean: you can also try running znc with --debug to see if it actually gets the connection at all
2014-01-17 16:21:04	drbean	From the other machine.

2014-01-28 09:40:28	trist4n	[09:56:46] why do you
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH2	[09:56:49] (As in the web-thing and the IRC client)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH2	[10:04:17] Surely there is a problem here.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH2	[10:04:52] I visit - I'll need to say it - redcalico.zapto.org, and it is nothing.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH2	[10:05:17] However zapto.org is, even though it only redirects to noip.com.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH_	[10:16:23] I'm not feeling hopeful that this VPS is even configured correctly for ZNC...
2014-01-28 09:40:28	CalebH_	[10:25:33] Actually, I'm running 0.206, not 0.9

2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:45:58] Building "noctcp.so" for ZNC 1.2... noctcp.cpp:1:21: fatal error: Modules.h: No such file or directory

2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:49:16] changed it to #include "/usr/include/znc/Modules.h"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:49:21] and it built
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[05:50:50] the proper fix is to use: #include <znc/Modules.h>
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:51:21] ah
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:51:25] I'll do that the next time
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[05:52:12] yah, changed it to that and it built too
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:13:07] is it me or are znc usernames case sensitive?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:13:12] where as they shouldn't be
2014-01-28 09:40:28	MarkyP	[06:13:53] who says they shouldnt be
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:14:11] passwords are usually case sensitive
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:14:15] usernames are not
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:18:15] guess I'll shutdown my znc instance
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Cpuroast	[06:18:29] and edit the config file, to change all the network names to lowercase

2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:00:20] I was wondering if there is a module similar to 'notify_connect' that is configurable to only send the attach/detach messages to configured admins? or eg: Make the module a user module instead of global
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[11:19:29] asking on freenode and EFnet ... lolz
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:20:05] no response on either, is why
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[11:24:16] so... make notify_connect a usermode and need to be an admin to see the notices and stuff?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:24:50] I can attempt it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:25:01] the last module I tried to make/duplicate crashed the service
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:25:15] and there is over 200 active users on it... so Im a bit nervous
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[11:26:51] s/usermode/usermodule/
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ZNCLinker	[11:26:52] KindOne meant: “so... make notify_connect a usermodule and need to be an admin to see the notices and stuff?”
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[11:26:53] bah..

2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[11:31:10] for the "OnLoad" / "isadmin" check... https://github.com/znc/znc/blob/master/modules/dcc.cpp#L89 though lines 96

2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:57:30] KindOne, there is no OnLoad function
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[11:59:27] This is the entire file.. http://puu.sh/6nG2r.png
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[12:15:14] <KindOne> and maybe create an "OnLoad" and check for "isadmin" and fail to load if not admin
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[12:15:38] my link was an example one, I guess you would just copy/paste it into the code
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[12:19:35] ok, I can just add it?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[12:19:42] oh I see, sorry I misread what you said
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[12:42:24] So the OnClientLogin would only be called if that user logged in(the one who has the usermod loaded)? Or if any user logged in?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[13:07:09] KindOne?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:06:45] What does the fact I can connect to znc from a different machine, but get a disconnection: 'irc: connection timeout (message 001 not received)'
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:06:55] imply.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	trist4n	[16:07:06] >ing
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:07:28] Connecting to znc from the same machine, there is no timeout and I get the IRC MOTD.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[16:08:24] sounds like a firewall
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:08:57] This is with systemctl stop firewalld.service, ie firewall off, on both machines.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[16:09:38] did you set the allowed ips list in znc+
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:12:41] There's nothing in allowed IPs for the user.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:14:01] Another high-port server app, vnc is working from the same machine as znc, so I doubt it is the school network the machine is behind.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	trist4n	[16:14:28] have you tried the old "nc on the port and telnet to it" school of network troubleshooting
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[16:16:40] drbean: are the ssl settings the same on both clients trying to connect?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:17:39] I didn't try nc, but in /server raw in weechat on the other machine I'm connecting from, I see only repeated: "NICK drbean  USER drbean 0 * :drbean  PASS [deleted] "
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Collin	[16:19:51] Does anyone know where I can find a mirror site with this module on it? http://wiki.znc.in/Notify
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:19:56] On neither machine is the client using ssl.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:20:32] Perhaps I should try using ssl. I can remember that solving a problem before.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[16:20:49] drbean: you can also try running znc with --debug to see if it actually gets the connection at all
2014-01-28 09:40:28	drbean	[16:21:04] From the other machine.

2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[03:40:17] might as well stop wasting my time and write a znc module that will msg people doing the /nick crap to say they are away
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:40:29] hm? added? political bullshit?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:41:14] and I would vote for merging such a module :->
2014-01-28 09:40:28	KindOne	[03:44:09] but that would be spammy.. why would someone add such a thing...
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:45:15] why would someone load such a module? because that someone is annoyed by away nicks and wants to annoy back
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:45:18] their choice
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:51:42] political bullshit?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:52:10] I'm ok to merge that, but if it's done properly
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:54:08] I wouldn't merge that, but I wouldn't complain if it is merged either
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:54:25] but yeah, that one definitely had more "external comments" than other pull requests
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@flakes	[04:41:09] better set up a FAQ page dedicated to awaynick as well, bet a lot of people will come here asking questions ;)

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:19:14] aha!
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:19:36] psychon: for some reason I thought that old ubuntu is older than old debian
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:20:24] what's up with this alias.cpp build failure anyway? I don't really understand why this only seems to affect some people
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:20:57] gcc 4.2, 4.4 don't like it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:21:04] Modern compilers are fine
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:21:43] It uses CModule::AddCommand, and CAlias (or whatever) ::AddCommand
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:22:21] I guess I should be happy that I dont react to most bug reports then
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:22:33] And cast to member function type for AddCommand of AddCommand
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:22:59] And cast confuses which of AddCommand it should cast
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:23:14] can't we have an <template T> void AddCommand() that somehow auto-magically figures out the type of the class? :-/
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:23:43] No
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:24:15] "T::foo" can't be autofigured out what is T
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:24:30] struct A { typedef int A; };
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:24:37] ups.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:24:40] struct A { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:24:45] struct B { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:24:49] true
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:25:25] The function inside alias module may just be renamed
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:26:24] psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function() which isn't available in C++03
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:26:34] s/n\(\)/n/
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ZNCLinker	[22:26:35] DGandalf meant: “psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function which isn't available in C++03”
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:28:01] hm, could we implement our own cheap hack/copy of std::function?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:28:58] Sure, there are a few implementations around
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:29:03] E.g. in boost, and few others
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:29:46] hm :(
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[22:29:47] But I'd prefer std::function instead of one more NIH :(
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:30:01] yeah, the various options aren't all that nice

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[01:09:08] Han`: ^^ :\
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:14:29] i get perl error
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:15:11] when i use make clean, the ./bootstrap.sh and ./configure, it works fine
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:16:30] delete the modperl/ZNC.cpp files?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:16:40] -s

2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:23:20] finally only deleting the ZNC.cpp will help
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:25:01] looks good DGandalf

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[01:25:39] I hope debian will abandon current oldstable soon
2014-01-28 09:40:28	j4jackj	[01:25:44] me2
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:25:56] bah
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:26:02] too much work for me atm
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:26:31] its not my stuff, i have some webcleints and their stuff
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Han`	[01:26:41] +only
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[02:00:14] psychon: wiki on debian says that oldstable is usually becomes abandoned in a year after new stable is released, except if new stable was happened less than in a year
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[02:00:23] And stable was released in may 2013
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[02:01:29] uhm, what does abandoned mean in this context?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[02:02:34] "no more security updates"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[02:02:54] heh, as if people using oldstable would care
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:04:41] Hey. I came here early in the morning about a .Split problem. When I input any type of character it Splits something different (I think I had ";;;;;" = "info"). http://pastebin.com/2VK5n9Up (I'm relatively new at C++)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:11:53] It is legal, it will throw an exception
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:12:14] Which will make znc die in agony, yeah
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:12:15] I don't think std::vector does that
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:14:04] That actually runs.. before it threw an exception. I want to see if someone uses *!*@*. What would be the best way in your opinion?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:14:11] uses something in the format of*
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:14:28] oh, right
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:14:34] psychon: only .at() throws the exception
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:14:40] yeah
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:14:42] http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/at
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:15:02] n00b502: so you just want to check if the string contains a @? if (s.find('@') != CString::npos)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:15:47] Yeah, that, but then I want to get the data. It's basically for adding hostmasks (or nicks, etc) but with wildcard support.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:15:58] So it could add something like nick!*@*
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:16:03] If you know what I mean..
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:17:03] There is already wildcard support in CString
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:17:14] So if no data is used (and not a wildcard) then don't process it. So something like this wouldn't process (!*@*
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:17:30] Since it doesn't have nick in it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:19:37] It could help you if I told you it was for a proxy blacklist where I can add hosts or idents or nicks, so when they join it kicks them instantly. 
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:20:36] if (s.find('@') != CString::npos) s += "!*@*";
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:20:49] "if it doesn't contain a @ yet, assume it is just a nick and turn it into a nickmask"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:21:10] (although I have no idea how you'd want to tell nicks or idents apart)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:21:40] I was planning on using split for "!" in the string, but it's not working properly.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:23:00] so what exactly do you want to do with strings containing ! and what with those who dont?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:24:28] Process it if it contains a "!" else just ignore it.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:24:56] So basically, to process it should be in *!*@* format
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[03:25:27] Check the string against wildcard "*!*@*"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:26:04] Yes, but then I'd want to get the data from it. (e.g. if nick!*@* I'd want to get 'nick')
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:26:47] if (s.find('!') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No ! found"); return; } CString sNick = s.Token(0, "!"); s = s.Token(1, "!", true); if (s.find('@') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No @"); return; } CString sIdent = s.Token(0, "@"); CString sHost = s.Token(1, "@", true);
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:27:33] Thank you, I will give it a go.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:33:41] seems like I dont even remember the order of the arguments
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:33:54] s.Token(0, "!") should be s.Token(0, false, "!")
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:34:08] and s.Token(1, "!", true) should be s.Token(1, true, "!");
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:36:05] Awesome, it worked.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b502	[03:36:11] Thanks a lot for your time, I appreciate it.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	baus	[09:59:13] is there an easy way to update znc without compiling it?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b649	[10:26:09] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b649	[10:48:36] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[17:08:02] Oh, ok :(
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b856	[22:49:20] The last point it's getting to is "if (data.find('!') == CString::npos)" where it returns false
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:52:14] hm?!?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[22:52:37] no, a function return a CString can not return a boolean
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b935	[23:39:49] Wait, nevermind. I'm an idiot.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[00:05:41] if ((var != "" && var != "var1") || var != "var2")
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[00:05:46] (if that's the meaning that you want)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[00:08:12] You can try compile with clang, it has different format of such messages
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b935	[00:08:29] I don't think so. What I want is to check if var isn't empty and var != "var1" or var != "var2"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b935	[00:08:31] if you get what I mean
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b935	[00:08:56] because wouldn't it throw an error if var was empty and I'm checking it against something?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[00:09:23] var != "var1" or var != "var2" <- that's always true...
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[00:09:39] if var == "var1", then the second case is true, else always the first one
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[00:09:55] also, no, there is no problem with var being empty
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b935	[00:10:03] Ah yeah, it needs to be &&

2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[07:55:12] Now I did, problem not solved though :)

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[07:56:38] Did you tell your client to use SSL?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[07:56:56] with +PORT (irssi) yes
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[07:57:04] irssi doesn't like +port
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[07:57:09] with -ssl for irssi..
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[07:57:09] irssi likes -ssl port
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[07:58:57]  so /connect -ssl host port user:pw
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[07:59:16] Atleast that worked, not sure how to check if the connection is running ssl 
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:00:41] /whois nick
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:00:53] should say Using a secured connection or smth
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[08:00:53] if /znc listports says it's ssl then it is
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:01:06] Sweet. Any reason to have SSL connection between znc and the 3 networks I am on?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[08:01:22] encrypt all the things
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:01:35] if encryption is possible, it should be used
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:01:51] Okey. I will try to get that running then, thanks alot m8s :)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:01:57] that applies to EVERYTHING
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:03:02] I certainly agree :) Just thought as long as the connection between my house and the shell was encrypted that would be good enough. Its not like I am hacking pentagon or planning terorism on IRC :p
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:03:56] should you be doing something wrong to want privacy?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:04:06] that's what is wrong with the world
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:04:25] people don't understand what they lose if they give up privacy

2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:35:17] SourceX: https://www.quakenet.org/articles/99-trust-is-not-transitive-or-why-irc-over-ssl-is-pointless
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:35:38] sure
2014-01-28 09:40:28	j4jackj	[08:35:52] zehl gmh
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:35:57] zehl!
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:35:59] you can say that the nsa has the capability to decode all your data too
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:36:08] but is it cost effective?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:36:15] I do not believe that to be true
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:36:43] if the nsa wants you, they will have you
2014-01-28 09:40:28	SourceX	[08:37:04] they even bring toys and lube
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:37:17] Sure as SSH HTTPS and so on aint bulletproof
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:37:42] but if I wanted to hide one file from NSA and then give them the tumbdrive I am sure there are encryptions that would keep them from getting to it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[08:37:45] they are not god :p
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[10:13:03] any ircop on the server
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[10:13:15] wrong chat
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:36:22] ubuntu x64
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[15:37:03] are you sure you have libssl-dev installed? if so, just run ./configure without the parameter and znc will find it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:37:57] hmm that worked
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:38:04] simple
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:38:20] ive always included that at config time
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:38:34] thank you
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Aracat	[15:42:12] for what it's worth, the last time i did a source build i had to provide the path to the headers, not the full path of the openssl binary
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:54:04] Hm, I'm for dropping --with-openssl. If ssl is installed in some weird path, user always can add PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS manually
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:54:27] to env
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:54:53] i like the functionality, ive had shells on BSD boxes and needed to include it for configure to find openssl
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:55:16] Did you install openssl yourself there?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:55:30] no
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:55:37] What is the path?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:55:40] it was a shell ona box
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:55:53] i do not recall
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:56:37] forcing users to set environment variables takes a lot of the 'ease of use' away, imo
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:56:38] What BSD was that?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:56:50] this was a freebsd box
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[15:57:14] i remember i had to use gmake as well
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:57:27] That was an ooold version
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:57:39] Now ZNC checks if make or gmake should be used, and tells so
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[15:58:06] But with --with... We would need to do the same to all other external stuff we use?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:01:05] you mean like add params for python, perl, etc? no i do not think that is necessary
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:01:15] Apparently, since ZNC started to tell the command how to build, noone appeared on IRC with question "make shows strange error"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:01:37] And why is it necessary for ssl?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:01:54] ssl is for security, it is a 'deal breaker' if it is not installed. the other things are just features
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:03:42] DGandalf: out of curiousity, what is really gained by dropping --with-openssl?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:03:44] o.O
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:04:26] nate: users who are trying to use it in configure on normal OSes where libssl is findable by default
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:05:53] There are lots of people who turn every possible flag on, even if it has sane defaults, and if they don't really need effect of that flag
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:05:55] I think that's just a habitual thing really, people may not expect znc to load openssl by default (like a lot of things still need --with-openssl to do so), what's it hurt though if they do?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:06:13] like if they do --with-openssl isn't effectively the same as default (it just searches the default paths)?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:06:17] What are those other things?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:06:41] I've never saw it outside of ZNC
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:06:47] well i have been using znc for a bit, so ui  have old habits
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:06:56] habits bc i had to use them
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:07:01] a lot of the web tech I use offhand still require openssl enabled by that as far as I recall
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:07:10] but like me, other old users will learn that it works better now
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:07:11] PHP, lighttpd, pretty sure apache and nginx too
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:07:19] you dont need to express every parameter
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[16:07:42] hm, ok
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:07:57] ^
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:08:36] Most will simply treat --with-* as "search the common paths" anyways, I mean maybe make some kind of note that znc automatically tries to include openssl even without --with-openssl
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:09:01] there are notes in configure about it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[16:09:06] or change the --with-openssl flag to --with-openssl-dir instead (which is what things usually do if something is enabled by default but the path might be different, they do --with-*-dir=)
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:09:15] i just ignored them, bc of my previous usage
2014-01-28 09:40:28	waterm3l0	[16:10:12] i like the dir idea
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ZNCLinker	[16:10:26] [znc] DarthGandalf pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DrNoxg

2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:30:27] greetings
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:31:06] can somebody help me to make an irc bouncer?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	haltdef	[21:32:23] just install znc
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:34:52] haltdef: i am using windows
2014-01-28 09:40:28	haltdef	[21:35:09] that's fine, there's a windows port of znc
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:35:56] could you provide me a link?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[21:36:30] !win
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ZNCLinker	[21:36:30] ZNC for Windows: http://code.google.com/p/znc-msvc/wiki/WikiStart?tm=6
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[21:38:46] Tested that one yesterday did not work good on Windows 2012 :
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:45:57] when I shut down my notebook to stay connected on some channels
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:48:04] you haven't provided me link with znc.exe
2014-01-28 09:40:28	haltdef	[21:48:47] you'll need to install it on a pc that you don't turn off ¬¬
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:49:47] i see, the pc would be server
2014-01-28 09:40:28	lite	[21:50:40] in that case, can i find free bnc online?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@SilverLeo	[21:51:22] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers
2014-01-28 09:40:28	haltdef	[21:51:52] just run it on a raspberry pi or something
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[21:59:42] are there downloadable skins for znc?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:00:24] I can only hope you mean the webclient else...
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:00:27] er webadmin
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:00:50] yes
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:00:55] what else is there?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:00:58] =P
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:01:21] just making sure, I mean, there ARE weird people on the internet, maybe there's one somewhere who thinks the znc app itself has skins
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:01:31] hehe
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:01:37] as for their being skins, I have no idea
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:02:08] i only found one, but it is ugly
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:02:26] http://userstyles.org/styles/49994/znc-orange
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:02:29] tbh I didn't even think it was a skinnable kind of thing but
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:03:16] uh, apparently that entire thing is done using in-browser overrides, so, lol
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:03:20] not sure I'd call that a skin
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:05:15] ah, only looked at the gif
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:05:16] =P
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:05:30] maybe it is time to make one
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:05:32] yeah it requires either stylish or greasemonkey basically, so it's only doing it in your specific browser
2014-01-28 09:40:28	nate	[22:05:52] you'd have to all in all look at the webadmin source, I'm not sure it's really configured for style/skin swapping
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:06:15] i think i can hack my way trough it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ArcAngel	[22:06:28] edit sources to add a theme
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[03:44:12] hehe
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[03:44:15] i don´t like that
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[03:44:26] psychon: why is it not possible to change name on network while you have set it+
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[03:44:35] "once you set it"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:46:00] why is there no "rename user" functionality? :-P
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:46:16] mostly because of paths in ~/.znc/users/foo/network/bar
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:46:27] too easy to have stuff still save to the previous location
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[03:46:38] there are lots of places where those paths are/can be saved
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[05:05:32] psychon: maybe something to add
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[05:05:35] thats bugging me i abit
2014-01-28 09:40:28	Whiskey-	[05:08:38] why is it not in the webinterface?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	 *	psychon [05:09:37] looks around
2014-01-28 09:40:28	 *	psychon [05:09:43] checks under the carpet
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@psychon	[05:09:46] sorry, who is "it"?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:20:52] DGandalf i downloaded 1.2
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:21:11] That could not be error from 1.2
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:21:39] You have several ZNCs around?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:22:10] no
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:22:35] check /msg *status version
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:43:35] ahh i see, the box is running the old version already
2014-01-28 09:40:28	gmh	[05:44:10] :p
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:49:59] have to get the owner to update it or something
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:50:16] Or install 1.2 yourself
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:50:38] i thought thats what i did lastnight, but it still used the version the box is running
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:50:50] i'm still a noob to linux lol
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:51:06] Well, I don't know what did you do.. so
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:52:26] i did everything the wiki says, but when you put "znc --makeconf" it installs the version the box is running
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:52:32] so thats why i was using the old one
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:53:08] make install told you what exact command you need to run
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:53:13] Probably it's not just "znc"
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[05:53:22] /blah/blah/znc
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[05:54:34] ok
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@fred	[06:02:53] right XeroXed 
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:03:02] awesome, its working
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@fred	[06:03:09] ofc
2014-01-28 09:40:28	ZNCLinker	[06:14:46] [znc] DarthGandalf closed issue #412: Exploit in privmessage causes memory-leak http://git.io/BqADmg
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:22:07] hrm, now i can connect to the webadmin page but the via irc
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:22:08] lol
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:41:11] I asked this yesterday, but I got the answer OnJoin() which is for when someone joins. Is there an event for when znc joins a channel?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:41:57] Compare nick
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:42:16] What do you mean?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:42:30] You receive nick who joined the channel
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:42:33] in OnJoin()
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:42:39] ZNC knows own nick
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:42:48] You may check if it was you who joined
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:42:58] Ah, right, I get it.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:43:00] Thanks a lot.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:43:12] If you want when user sends /join, it's another callback
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:43:33] Just for reference, what is that?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:44:06] Check Modules.h, there is the list
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:44:14] :P
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:46:50] OnUserJoin maybe?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	n00b592	[06:47:17] Yeah, it is. Thanks.
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:47:49] any idea why its saying ssl isn't enabled?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:48:09] You need libssl-dev installed on debian for that
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:48:25] ok
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:48:34] Which may be installed by owner of that box
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:49:02] i don't have root access
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:50:57] another issue, it doesn't seem to be saving on the webadmin panel when i add irc servers
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:51:17] why not?
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:51:37] not sure, i click edit after i save it and nothing is there
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:55:08] what do you add there?

2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:55:36] But you compiled without SSL support
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:55:53] hrm, so i need to recompile it
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:56:17] Either make sure that libssl-dev installed and recompile, or don't use ssl
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[06:57:13] it should be installed, ssl was working on the older version
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:58:37] Runtime dependencies are different from build dependencies
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[06:59:03] libssl binary is installed, sure. But to build, you need both binary and headers
2014-01-28 09:40:28	@DGandalf	[07:02:27] Or you can try to install openssl yourself, but better just ask owner to install -dev
2014-01-28 09:40:28	XeroXed	[07:09:02] oh well, i give up lol

2014-01-28 10:21:03	 *	drbean tap, taps microphone.
2014-01-28 10:22:46	drbean	I wonder if my problems connecting to ZNC on 6666 is related to command & control server use of IRC on 6666 to control bots.
2014-01-28 10:25:35	drbean	efnet was temporarily k-lining an IP through which my connection to ZNC was routed.
2014-01-28 10:26:34	drbean	On port 6666.
2014-01-28 10:28:26	drbean	I wonder what the sysadmins at my school have been doing.

2014-01-28 10:29:15	SourceX	evidently not their job
2014-01-28 10:29:36	drbean	Traceroute to the ZNC IP * * *'s out when it reaches the first IP in the school block.
2014-01-28 10:30:19	drbean	They know very little about IRC, but more about infected machines, he-he.
2014-01-28 10:32:01	drbean	http://cbl.abuseat.org/advanced.html says: simply looking for IRC connections that you're not expecting (port 6666) will ...
2014-01-28 10:32:52	drbean	I though 6666 was a good port for clients to connect to ZNC, and have ZNC connect to IRC on 6667.
2014-01-28 10:33:47	drbean	Perhaps the sysadmins blacklisted clients.
2014-01-28 10:34:16	drbean	Do I have to run client-ZNC connections on different ports to the ZNC-IRC ones?
2014-01-28 10:39:13	drbean	I assumed they had to be different, but perhaps that's incorrect.
2014-01-28 10:40:14	SourceX	no
2014-01-28 10:40:24	SourceX	that port is irrelevant of any outgoing connections
2014-01-28 10:40:46	drbean	Connection to the webadmin web server and ZNC are run on the same port, so perhaps client-ZNC and ZNC-IRC connections can be run on the same port.
2014-01-28 10:41:10	drbean	So, I can run them on the same port?
2014-01-28 10:41:31	SourceX	the listening port (for connecting to znc) is completely different than the irc ports (which are listening ports on the irc server)
2014-01-28 10:42:27	SourceX	yes you can use an irc port for znc
2014-01-28 10:42:43	SourceX	and then connect to another address that uses that same port
2014-01-28 10:42:53	SourceX	it's the equivalent of connecting to different websites
2014-01-28 10:43:00	SourceX	they all use port 80/443
2014-01-28 10:43:09	SourceX	but you could run your own local webserver on 80 & 443

2014-01-28 13:01:54	Collin	[11:00:20] I was wondering if there is a module similar to 'notify_connect' that is configurable to only send the attach/detach messages to configured admins? or eg: Make the module a user module instead of global
2014-01-28 13:01:54	KindOne	[11:19:29] asking on freenode and EFnet ... lolz
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Collin	[11:20:05] no response on either, is why
2014-01-28 13:01:54	KindOne	[11:24:16] so... make notify_connect a usermode and need to be an admin to see the notices and stuff?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Collin	[11:24:50] I can attempt it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Collin	[11:25:01] the last module I tried to make/duplicate crashed the service

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[16:08:24] sounds like a firewall
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:08:57] This is with systemctl stop firewalld.service, ie firewall off, on both machines.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[16:09:38] did you set the allowed ips list in znc+
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:12:41] There's nothing in allowed IPs for the user.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:14:01] Another high-port server app, vnc is working from the same machine as znc, so I doubt it is the school network the machine is behind.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	trist4n	[16:14:28] have you tried the old "nc on the port and telnet to it" school of network troubleshooting
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[16:16:40] drbean: are the ssl settings the same on both clients trying to connect?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:17:39] I didn't try nc, but in /server raw in weechat on the other machine I'm connecting from, I see only repeated: "NICK drbean  USER drbean 0 * :drbean  PASS [deleted] "
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Collin	[16:19:51] Does anyone know where I can find a mirror site with this module on it? http://wiki.znc.in/Notify
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:19:56] On neither machine is the client using ssl.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:20:32] Perhaps I should try using ssl. I can remember that solving a problem before.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[16:20:49] drbean: you can also try running znc with --debug to see if it actually gets the connection at all
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[16:21:04] From the other machine.

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:40:29] hm? added? political bullshit?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:41:14] and I would vote for merging such a module :->

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:45:15] why would someone load such a module? because that someone is annoyed by away nicks and wants to annoy back

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:51:42] political bullshit?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:52:10] I'm ok to merge that, but if it's done properly
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:54:08] I wouldn't merge that, but I wouldn't complain if it is merged either
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:54:25] but yeah, that one definitely had more "external comments" than other pull requests
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@flakes	[04:41:09] better set up a FAQ page dedicated to awaynick as well, bet a lot of people will come here asking questions ;)

2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[22:14:09] no matter
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[22:14:34] the last running runs fine
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:14:50] It seems, need to delay switch to C++11 :(
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:19:14] aha!
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:19:36] psychon: for some reason I thought that old ubuntu is older than old debian
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:20:24] what's up with this alias.cpp build failure anyway? I don't really understand why this only seems to affect some people
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:20:57] gcc 4.2, 4.4 don't like it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:21:04] Modern compilers are fine
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:21:43] It uses CModule::AddCommand, and CAlias (or whatever) ::AddCommand
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:22:21] I guess I should be happy that I dont react to most bug reports then
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:22:33] And cast to member function type for AddCommand of AddCommand
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:22:59] And cast confuses which of AddCommand it should cast
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:23:14] can't we have an <template T> void AddCommand() that somehow auto-magically figures out the type of the class? :-/
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:23:43] No
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:24:15] "T::foo" can't be autofigured out what is T
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:24:30] struct A { typedef int A; };
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:24:37] ups.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:24:40] struct A { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:24:45] struct B { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:24:49] true
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:25:25] The function inside alias module may just be renamed
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:26:24] psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function() which isn't available in C++03
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:26:34] s/n\(\)/n/
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ZNCLinker	[22:26:35] DGandalf meant: “psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function which isn't available in C++03”
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:28:01] hm, could we implement our own cheap hack/copy of std::function?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:28:58] Sure, there are a few implementations around
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:29:03] E.g. in boost, and few others
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:29:46] hm :(
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[22:29:47] But I'd prefer std::function instead of one more NIH :(
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:30:01] yeah, the various options aren't all that nice

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[01:09:08] Han`: ^^ :\
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:14:29] i get perl error
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:15:11] when i use make clean, the ./bootstrap.sh and ./configure, it works fine
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:16:30] delete the modperl/ZNC.cpp files?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:16:40] -s
2014-01-28 13:01:54	travis-ci	[01:17:13] [travis-ci] znc/znc#321 (master - 60b2f55 : Alexey Sokolov): The build passed.

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[01:19:43] make clean should delete them if they are generated via swig by you ,yes
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:23:20] finally only deleting the ZNC.cpp will help
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:25:01] looks good DGandalf
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:25:07] ZNC 1.3-git-56-60b2f55
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[01:25:39] I hope debian will abandon current oldstable soon
2014-01-28 13:01:54	j4jackj	[01:25:44] me2
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:25:56] bah
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:26:02] too much work for me atm
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:26:31] its not my stuff, i have some webcleints and their stuff
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Han`	[01:26:41] +only
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[02:00:14] psychon: wiki on debian says that oldstable is usually becomes abandoned in a year after new stable is released, except if new stable was happened less than in a year
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[02:00:23] And stable was released in may 2013
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[02:01:29] uhm, what does abandoned mean in this context?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[02:02:34] "no more security updates"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[02:02:54] heh, as if people using oldstable would care
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:04:41] Hey. I came here early in the morning about a .Split problem. When I input any type of character it Splits something different (I think I had ";;;;;" = "info"). http://pastebin.com/2VK5n9Up (I'm relatively new at C++)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:11:53] It is legal, it will throw an exception
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:12:14] Which will make znc die in agony, yeah
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:12:15] I don't think std::vector does that
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:14:04] That actually runs.. before it threw an exception. I want to see if someone uses *!*@*. What would be the best way in your opinion?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:14:11] uses something in the format of*
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:14:28] oh, right
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:14:34] psychon: only .at() throws the exception
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:14:40] yeah
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:14:42] http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/at
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:15:02] n00b502: so you just want to check if the string contains a @? if (s.find('@') != CString::npos)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:15:47] Yeah, that, but then I want to get the data. It's basically for adding hostmasks (or nicks, etc) but with wildcard support.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:15:58] So it could add something like nick!*@*
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:16:03] If you know what I mean..
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:17:03] There is already wildcard support in CString
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:17:14] So if no data is used (and not a wildcard) then don't process it. So something like this wouldn't process (!*@*
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:17:30] Since it doesn't have nick in it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:19:37] It could help you if I told you it was for a proxy blacklist where I can add hosts or idents or nicks, so when they join it kicks them instantly. 
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:20:36] if (s.find('@') != CString::npos) s += "!*@*";
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:20:49] "if it doesn't contain a @ yet, assume it is just a nick and turn it into a nickmask"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:21:10] (although I have no idea how you'd want to tell nicks or idents apart)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:21:40] I was planning on using split for "!" in the string, but it's not working properly.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:23:00] so what exactly do you want to do with strings containing ! and what with those who dont?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:24:28] Process it if it contains a "!" else just ignore it.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:24:56] So basically, to process it should be in *!*@* format
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[03:25:27] Check the string against wildcard "*!*@*"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:26:04] Yes, but then I'd want to get the data from it. (e.g. if nick!*@* I'd want to get 'nick')
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:26:47] if (s.find('!') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No ! found"); return; } CString sNick = s.Token(0, "!"); s = s.Token(1, "!", true); if (s.find('@') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No @"); return; } CString sIdent = s.Token(0, "@"); CString sHost = s.Token(1, "@", true);
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:27:33] Thank you, I will give it a go.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:33:41] seems like I dont even remember the order of the arguments
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:33:54] s.Token(0, "!") should be s.Token(0, false, "!")
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:34:08] and s.Token(1, "!", true) should be s.Token(1, true, "!");
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:36:05] Awesome, it worked.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b502	[03:36:11] Thanks a lot for your time, I appreciate it.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	baus	[09:59:13] is there an easy way to update znc without compiling it?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b649	[10:26:09] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b649	[10:48:36] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[10:56:13] or my favorite letmein. I actually use that for my guest wlan. Don't tell anyone c",)

2014-01-28 13:01:54	lsdigital	[10:56:41] yum
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[17:07:46] DGandalf: no, that's my password, pick your own
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[17:08:02] Oh, ok :(
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b856	[22:49:20] The last point it's getting to is "if (data.find('!') == CString::npos)" where it returns false
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:52:14] hm?!?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[22:52:37] no, a function return a CString can not return a boolean
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b935	[23:39:49] Wait, nevermind. I'm an idiot.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[00:05:41] if ((var != "" && var != "var1") || var != "var2")
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[00:05:46] (if that's the meaning that you want)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[00:08:12] You can try compile with clang, it has different format of such messages
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b935	[00:08:29] I don't think so. What I want is to check if var isn't empty and var != "var1" or var != "var2"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b935	[00:08:31] if you get what I mean
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b935	[00:08:56] because wouldn't it throw an error if var was empty and I'm checking it against something?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[00:09:23] var != "var1" or var != "var2" <- that's always true...
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[00:09:39] if var == "var1", then the second case is true, else always the first one
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[00:09:55] also, no, there is no problem with var being empty
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b935	[00:10:03] Ah yeah, it needs to be &&

2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[07:46:25] gmh: you haven't actually told us what exactly is not working
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:48:02] SilverLeo: NOTHING WORKS!
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[07:48:23] excellent, the plan works ;)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:48:32] Oh. Right
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:51:06] SilverLeo: I dont get to connect to my bouncer if I activate ssl
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:51:06] SilverLeo: If haveing another none-SSL client up it says "IP tried to connect, invalid password or smth"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[07:51:06] did you use the right password?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:51:11] SourceX: indeed. Tripple checked
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:51:34] Cna i 
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[07:51:55] znc -D
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[07:51:58] check logs
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:52:18] can I use "openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout znc.key -x509 -days 365 -out znc.crt"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:52:23] then "cat znc.crt znc.key > znc.pem"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[07:52:36] why don't you use znc --makepem ?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:52:37] if I did not create a .pem file with --makeconfig
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:52:49] SilverLeo: cause I did not know I could :)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:52:52] <- noob znc user
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:55:12] Now I did, problem not solved though :)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:56:00] "Connection to host established"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:56:07] "Connection to host lost"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:56:38] Did you tell your client to use SSL?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:56:56] with +PORT (irssi) yes
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:57:04] irssi doesn't like +port
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[07:57:09] with -ssl for irssi..
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:57:09] irssi likes -ssl port
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:58:57]  so /connect -ssl host port user:pw
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[07:59:16] Atleast that worked, not sure how to check if the connection is running ssl 
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:00:41] /whois nick
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:00:53] should say Using a secured connection or smth
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[08:00:53] if /znc listports says it's ssl then it is
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:01:06] Sweet. Any reason to have SSL connection between znc and the 3 networks I am on?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[08:01:22] encrypt all the things
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:01:35] if encryption is possible, it should be used
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:01:51] Okey. I will try to get that running then, thanks alot m8s :)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:01:57] that applies to EVERYTHING
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:03:02] I certainly agree :) Just thought as long as the connection between my house and the shell was encrypted that would be good enough. Its not like I am hacking pentagon or planning terorism on IRC :p
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:03:56] should you be doing something wrong to want privacy?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:04:06] that's what is wrong with the world
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:04:25] people don't understand what they lose if they give up privacy
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[08:05:15] SilverLeo: http://sprunge.us/RESe?diff
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:06:36] SourceX: SourceX: point taken
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[08:06:58] DGandalf: yea, less hassle for the user. sounds good

2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:35:59] you can say that the nsa has the capability to decode all your data too
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:36:08] but is it cost effective?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:36:15] I do not believe that to be true
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:36:43] if the nsa wants you, they will have you
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[08:37:04] they even bring toys and lube
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:37:17] Sure as SSH HTTPS and so on aint bulletproof
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:37:42] but if I wanted to hide one file from NSA and then give them the tumbdrive I am sure there are encryptions that would keep them from getting to it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[08:37:45] they are not god :p
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[10:13:03] any ircop on the server

2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:36:22] ubuntu x64
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[15:37:03] are you sure you have libssl-dev installed? if so, just run ./configure without the parameter and znc will find it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:37:57] hmm that worked
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:38:04] simple
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:38:20] ive always included that at config time
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:38:34] thank you
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Aracat	[15:42:12] for what it's worth, the last time i did a source build i had to provide the path to the headers, not the full path of the openssl binary
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:54:04] Hm, I'm for dropping --with-openssl. If ssl is installed in some weird path, user always can add PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS manually
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:54:27] to env
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:54:53] i like the functionality, ive had shells on BSD boxes and needed to include it for configure to find openssl
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:55:16] Did you install openssl yourself there?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:55:30] no
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:55:37] What is the path?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:55:40] it was a shell ona box
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:55:53] i do not recall
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:56:37] forcing users to set environment variables takes a lot of the 'ease of use' away, imo
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:56:38] What BSD was that?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:56:50] this was a freebsd box
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[15:57:14] i remember i had to use gmake as well
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:57:27] That was an ooold version
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:57:39] Now ZNC checks if make or gmake should be used, and tells so
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[15:58:06] But with --with... We would need to do the same to all other external stuff we use?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:01:05] you mean like add params for python, perl, etc? no i do not think that is necessary
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:01:15] Apparently, since ZNC started to tell the command how to build, noone appeared on IRC with question "make shows strange error"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:01:37] And why is it necessary for ssl?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:01:54] ssl is for security, it is a 'deal breaker' if it is not installed. the other things are just features
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:03:42] DGandalf: out of curiousity, what is really gained by dropping --with-openssl?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:03:44] o.O
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:04:26] nate: users who are trying to use it in configure on normal OSes where libssl is findable by default
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:05:53] There are lots of people who turn every possible flag on, even if it has sane defaults, and if they don't really need effect of that flag
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:05:55] I think that's just a habitual thing really, people may not expect znc to load openssl by default (like a lot of things still need --with-openssl to do so), what's it hurt though if they do?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:06:13] like if they do --with-openssl isn't effectively the same as default (it just searches the default paths)?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:06:17] What are those other things?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:06:41] I've never saw it outside of ZNC
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:06:47] well i have been using znc for a bit, so ui  have old habits
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:06:56] habits bc i had to use them
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:07:01] a lot of the web tech I use offhand still require openssl enabled by that as far as I recall
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:07:10] but like me, other old users will learn that it works better now
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:07:11] PHP, lighttpd, pretty sure apache and nginx too
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:07:19] you dont need to express every parameter
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[16:07:42] hm, ok
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:07:57] ^
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:08:36] Most will simply treat --with-* as "search the common paths" anyways, I mean maybe make some kind of note that znc automatically tries to include openssl even without --with-openssl
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:09:01] there are notes in configure about it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[16:09:06] or change the --with-openssl flag to --with-openssl-dir instead (which is what things usually do if something is enabled by default but the path might be different, they do --with-*-dir=)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:09:15] i just ignored them, bc of my previous usage
2014-01-28 13:01:54	waterm3l0	[16:10:12] i like the dir idea
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ZNCLinker	[16:10:26] [znc] DarthGandalf pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DrNoxg

2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[17:06:38] i got everything else setup, but the webadmin page won't work
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:30:27] greetings
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:31:06] can somebody help me to make an irc bouncer?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	haltdef	[21:32:23] just install znc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:34:52] haltdef: i am using windows
2014-01-28 13:01:54	haltdef	[21:35:09] that's fine, there's a windows port of znc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:35:56] could you provide me a link?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[21:36:30] !win
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ZNCLinker	[21:36:30] ZNC for Windows: http://code.google.com/p/znc-msvc/wiki/WikiStart?tm=6
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[21:38:46] Tested that one yesterday did not work good on Windows 2012 :
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:45:57] when I shut down my notebook to stay connected on some channels
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:48:04] you haven't provided me link with znc.exe
2014-01-28 13:01:54	haltdef	[21:48:47] you'll need to install it on a pc that you don't turn off ¬¬
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:49:47] i see, the pc would be server
2014-01-28 13:01:54	lite	[21:50:40] in that case, can i find free bnc online?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@SilverLeo	[21:51:22] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers
2014-01-28 13:01:54	haltdef	[21:51:52] just run it on a raspberry pi or something
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[21:59:42] are there downloadable skins for znc?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:00:24] I can only hope you mean the webclient else...
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:00:27] er webadmin
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:00:50] yes
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:00:55] what else is there?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:00:58] =P
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:01:21] just making sure, I mean, there ARE weird people on the internet, maybe there's one somewhere who thinks the znc app itself has skins
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:01:31] hehe
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:01:37] as for their being skins, I have no idea
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:02:08] i only found one, but it is ugly
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:02:26] http://userstyles.org/styles/49994/znc-orange
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:02:29] tbh I didn't even think it was a skinnable kind of thing but
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:03:16] uh, apparently that entire thing is done using in-browser overrides, so, lol
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:03:20] not sure I'd call that a skin
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:05:15] ah, only looked at the gif
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:05:16] =P
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:05:30] maybe it is time to make one
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:05:32] yeah it requires either stylish or greasemonkey basically, so it's only doing it in your specific browser
2014-01-28 13:01:54	nate	[22:05:52] you'd have to all in all look at the webadmin source, I'm not sure it's really configured for style/skin swapping
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:06:15] i think i can hack my way trough it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ArcAngel	[22:06:28] edit sources to add a theme
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[03:44:12] hehe
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[03:44:15] i don´t like that
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[03:44:26] psychon: why is it not possible to change name on network while you have set it+
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[03:44:35] "once you set it"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:46:00] why is there no "rename user" functionality? :-P
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:46:16] mostly because of paths in ~/.znc/users/foo/network/bar
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:46:27] too easy to have stuff still save to the previous location
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[03:46:38] there are lots of places where those paths are/can be saved
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[05:05:32] psychon: maybe something to add
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[05:05:35] thats bugging me i abit
2014-01-28 13:01:54	Whiskey-	[05:08:38] why is it not in the webinterface?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	 *	psychon [05:09:37] looks around
2014-01-28 13:01:54	 *	psychon [05:09:43] checks under the carpet
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@psychon	[05:09:46] sorry, who is "it"?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:20:52] DGandalf i downloaded 1.2
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:21:11] That could not be error from 1.2
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:21:39] You have several ZNCs around?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:22:10] no
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:22:35] check /msg *status version
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:43:35] ahh i see, the box is running the old version already
2014-01-28 13:01:54	gmh	[05:44:10] :p
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:49:59] have to get the owner to update it or something
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:50:16] Or install 1.2 yourself
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:50:38] i thought thats what i did lastnight, but it still used the version the box is running
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:50:50] i'm still a noob to linux lol
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:51:06] Well, I don't know what did you do.. so
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:52:26] i did everything the wiki says, but when you put "znc --makeconf" it installs the version the box is running
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:52:32] so thats why i was using the old one
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:53:08] make install told you what exact command you need to run
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:53:13] Probably it's not just "znc"
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[05:53:22] /blah/blah/znc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[05:54:34] ok
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@fred	[06:02:53] right XeroXed 
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:03:02] awesome, its working
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@fred	[06:03:09] ofc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	ZNCLinker	[06:14:46] [znc] DarthGandalf closed issue #412: Exploit in privmessage causes memory-leak http://git.io/BqADmg
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:22:07] hrm, now i can connect to the webadmin page but the via irc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:22:08] lol
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:41:11] I asked this yesterday, but I got the answer OnJoin() which is for when someone joins. Is there an event for when znc joins a channel?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:41:57] Compare nick
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:42:16] What do you mean?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:42:30] You receive nick who joined the channel
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:42:33] in OnJoin()
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:42:39] ZNC knows own nick
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:42:48] You may check if it was you who joined
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:42:58] Ah, right, I get it.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:43:00] Thanks a lot.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:43:12] If you want when user sends /join, it's another callback
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:43:33] Just for reference, what is that?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:44:06] Check Modules.h, there is the list
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:44:14] :P
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:46:50] OnUserJoin maybe?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	n00b592	[06:47:17] Yeah, it is. Thanks.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:47:49] any idea why its saying ssl isn't enabled?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:48:09] You need libssl-dev installed on debian for that
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:48:25] ok
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:48:34] Which may be installed by owner of that box
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:49:02] i don't have root access
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:50:57] another issue, it doesn't seem to be saving on the webadmin panel when i add irc servers
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:51:17] why not?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:51:37] not sure, i click edit after i save it and nothing is there
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:55:08] what do you add there?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:55:22] efnet.xs4all.nl +6697
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:55:36] But you compiled without SSL support
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:55:53] hrm, so i need to recompile it
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:56:17] Either make sure that libssl-dev installed and recompile, or don't use ssl
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[06:57:13] it should be installed, ssl was working on the older version
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:58:37] Runtime dependencies are different from build dependencies
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[06:59:03] libssl binary is installed, sure. But to build, you need both binary and headers
2014-01-28 13:01:54	@DGandalf	[07:02:27] Or you can try to install openssl yourself, but better just ask owner to install -dev
2014-01-28 13:01:54	XeroXed	[07:09:02] oh well, i give up lol
2014-01-28 13:01:54	 *	drbean [10:21:03] tap, taps microphone.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:22:46] I wonder if my problems connecting to ZNC on 6666 is related to command & control server use of IRC on 6666 to control bots.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:25:35] efnet was temporarily k-lining an IP through which my connection to ZNC was routed.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:26:34] On port 6666.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:28:26] I wonder what the sysadmins at my school have been doing. 
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:29:15] evidently not their job
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:29:36] Traceroute to the ZNC IP * * *'s out when it reaches the first IP in the school block.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:30:19] They know very little about IRC, but more about infected machines, he-he.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:32:01] http://cbl.abuseat.org/advanced.html says: simply looking for IRC connections that you're not expecting (port 6666) will ...
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:32:52] I though 6666 was a good port for clients to connect to ZNC, and have ZNC connect to IRC on 6667.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:33:47] Perhaps the sysadmins blacklisted clients.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:34:16] Do I have to run client-ZNC connections on different ports to the ZNC-IRC ones?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:39:13] I assumed they had to be different, but perhaps that's incorrect.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:40:14] no
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:40:24] that port is irrelevant of any outgoing connections
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:40:46] Connection to the webadmin web server and ZNC are run on the same port, so perhaps client-ZNC and ZNC-IRC connections can be run on the same port.
2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[10:41:10] So, I can run them on the same port?
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:41:31] the listening port (for connecting to znc) is completely different than the irc ports (which are listening ports on the irc server)
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:42:27] yes you can use an irc port for znc
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:42:43] and then connect to another address that uses that same port
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:42:53] it's the equivalent of connecting to different websites
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:43:00] they all use port 80/443
2014-01-28 13:01:54	SourceX	[10:43:09] but you could run your own local webserver on 80 & 443

2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[11:08:29] I try that on the webadmin web page and *status, but get the message:

2014-01-28 13:01:54	drbean	[11:10:28] 6667 is the address that ZNC connects to freenode:

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:41:14] and I would vote for merging such a module :->

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:45:15] why would someone load such a module? because that someone is annoyed by away nicks and wants to annoy back

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:13:16] When it will be outdated?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[22:14:06] ok, i prefer to stop using the znc git
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[22:14:09] no matter
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[22:14:34] the last running runs fine
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:14:50] It seems, need to delay switch to C++11 :(
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:19:14] aha!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:19:36] psychon: for some reason I thought that old ubuntu is older than old debian
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:20:24] what's up with this alias.cpp build failure anyway? I don't really understand why this only seems to affect some people
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:20:57] gcc 4.2, 4.4 don't like it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:21:04] Modern compilers are fine
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:21:43] It uses CModule::AddCommand, and CAlias (or whatever) ::AddCommand
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:22:21] I guess I should be happy that I dont react to most bug reports then
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:22:33] And cast to member function type for AddCommand of AddCommand
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:22:59] And cast confuses which of AddCommand it should cast
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:23:14] can't we have an <template T> void AddCommand() that somehow auto-magically figures out the type of the class? :-/
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:23:43] No
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:24:15] "T::foo" can't be autofigured out what is T
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:24:30] struct A { typedef int A; };
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:24:37] ups.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:24:40] struct A { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:24:45] struct B { typedef int foo; };
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:24:49] true
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:25:25] The function inside alias module may just be renamed
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:26:24] psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function() which isn't available in C++03
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:26:34] s/n\(\)/n/
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ZNCLinker	[22:26:35] DGandalf meant: “psychon: and AddCommand() should get just std::function which isn't available in C++03”
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:28:01] hm, could we implement our own cheap hack/copy of std::function?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:28:58] Sure, there are a few implementations around
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:29:03] E.g. in boost, and few others
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:29:46] hm :(
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[22:29:47] But I'd prefer std::function instead of one more NIH :(
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:30:01] yeah, the various options aren't all that nice

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[01:09:08] Han`: ^^ :\
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:14:29] i get perl error
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:15:11] when i use make clean, the ./bootstrap.sh and ./configure, it works fine
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:16:30] delete the modperl/ZNC.cpp files?

2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:23:20] finally only deleting the ZNC.cpp will help

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[01:25:39] I hope debian will abandon current oldstable soon

2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:25:56] bah
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:26:02] too much work for me atm
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:26:31] its not my stuff, i have some webcleints and their stuff
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Han`	[01:26:41] +only
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[02:00:14] psychon: wiki on debian says that oldstable is usually becomes abandoned in a year after new stable is released, except if new stable was happened less than in a year
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[02:00:23] And stable was released in may 2013
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[02:01:29] uhm, what does abandoned mean in this context?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[02:02:34] "no more security updates"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[02:02:54] heh, as if people using oldstable would care
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:04:41] Hey. I came here early in the morning about a .Split problem. When I input any type of character it Splits something different (I think I had ";;;;;" = "info"). http://pastebin.com/2VK5n9Up (I'm relatively new at C++)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:11:53] It is legal, it will throw an exception
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:12:14] Which will make znc die in agony, yeah
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:12:15] I don't think std::vector does that
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:14:04] That actually runs.. before it threw an exception. I want to see if someone uses *!*@*. What would be the best way in your opinion?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:14:11] uses something in the format of*
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:14:28] oh, right
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:14:34] psychon: only .at() throws the exception
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:14:40] yeah
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:14:42] http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/at
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:15:02] n00b502: so you just want to check if the string contains a @? if (s.find('@') != CString::npos)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:15:47] Yeah, that, but then I want to get the data. It's basically for adding hostmasks (or nicks, etc) but with wildcard support.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:15:58] So it could add something like nick!*@*
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:16:03] If you know what I mean..
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:17:03] There is already wildcard support in CString
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:17:14] So if no data is used (and not a wildcard) then don't process it. So something like this wouldn't process (!*@*
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:17:30] Since it doesn't have nick in it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:19:37] It could help you if I told you it was for a proxy blacklist where I can add hosts or idents or nicks, so when they join it kicks them instantly. 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:20:36] if (s.find('@') != CString::npos) s += "!*@*";
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:20:49] "if it doesn't contain a @ yet, assume it is just a nick and turn it into a nickmask"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:21:10] (although I have no idea how you'd want to tell nicks or idents apart)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:21:40] I was planning on using split for "!" in the string, but it's not working properly.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:23:00] so what exactly do you want to do with strings containing ! and what with those who dont?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:24:28] Process it if it contains a "!" else just ignore it.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:24:56] So basically, to process it should be in *!*@* format
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[03:25:27] Check the string against wildcard "*!*@*"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:26:04] Yes, but then I'd want to get the data from it. (e.g. if nick!*@* I'd want to get 'nick')
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:26:47] if (s.find('!') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No ! found"); return; } CString sNick = s.Token(0, "!"); s = s.Token(1, "!", true); if (s.find('@') == CString::npos) { PutModule("No @"); return; } CString sIdent = s.Token(0, "@"); CString sHost = s.Token(1, "@", true);
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:27:33] Thank you, I will give it a go.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:33:41] seems like I dont even remember the order of the arguments
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:33:54] s.Token(0, "!") should be s.Token(0, false, "!")
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:34:08] and s.Token(1, "!", true) should be s.Token(1, true, "!");
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:36:05] Awesome, it worked.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b502	[03:36:11] Thanks a lot for your time, I appreciate it.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	baus	[09:59:13] is there an easy way to update znc without compiling it?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b649	[10:26:09] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b649	[10:48:36] Is there any event which gets called once znc joins a room?

2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[17:08:02] Oh, ok :(
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b856	[22:49:20] The last point it's getting to is "if (data.find('!') == CString::npos)" where it returns false
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:52:14] hm?!?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[22:52:37] no, a function return a CString can not return a boolean
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b935	[23:39:49] Wait, nevermind. I'm an idiot.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[00:05:41] if ((var != "" && var != "var1") || var != "var2")
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[00:05:46] (if that's the meaning that you want)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[00:08:12] You can try compile with clang, it has different format of such messages
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b935	[00:08:29] I don't think so. What I want is to check if var isn't empty and var != "var1" or var != "var2"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b935	[00:08:31] if you get what I mean
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b935	[00:08:56] because wouldn't it throw an error if var was empty and I'm checking it against something?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[00:09:23] var != "var1" or var != "var2" <- that's always true...
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[00:09:39] if var == "var1", then the second case is true, else always the first one
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[00:09:55] also, no, there is no problem with var being empty
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b935	[00:10:03] Ah yeah, it needs to be &&

2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[07:56:56] with +PORT (irssi) yes
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[07:57:04] irssi doesn't like +port
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[07:57:09] with -ssl for irssi..
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[07:57:09] irssi likes -ssl port
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[07:58:57]  so /connect -ssl host port user:pw
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[07:59:16] Atleast that worked, not sure how to check if the connection is running ssl 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:00:41] /whois nick
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:00:53] should say Using a secured connection or smth
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[08:00:53] if /znc listports says it's ssl then it is
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[08:01:06] Sweet. Any reason to have SSL connection between znc and the 3 networks I am on?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[08:01:22] encrypt all the things
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:01:35] if encryption is possible, it should be used
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[08:01:51] Okey. I will try to get that running then, thanks alot m8s :)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:01:57] that applies to EVERYTHING
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[08:03:02] I certainly agree :) Just thought as long as the connection between my house and the shell was encrypted that would be good enough. Its not like I am hacking pentagon or planning terorism on IRC :p
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:03:56] should you be doing something wrong to want privacy?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[08:04:06] that's what is wrong with the world

2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[08:37:45] they are not god :p
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[10:13:03] any ircop on the server
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[10:13:15] wrong chat
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:36:22] ubuntu x64
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[15:37:03] are you sure you have libssl-dev installed? if so, just run ./configure without the parameter and znc will find it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:37:57] hmm that worked
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:38:04] simple
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:38:20] ive always included that at config time
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:38:34] thank you
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Aracat	[15:42:12] for what it's worth, the last time i did a source build i had to provide the path to the headers, not the full path of the openssl binary
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:54:04] Hm, I'm for dropping --with-openssl. If ssl is installed in some weird path, user always can add PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS manually
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:54:27] to env
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:54:53] i like the functionality, ive had shells on BSD boxes and needed to include it for configure to find openssl
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:55:16] Did you install openssl yourself there?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:55:30] no
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:55:37] What is the path?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:55:40] it was a shell ona box
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:55:53] i do not recall
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:56:37] forcing users to set environment variables takes a lot of the 'ease of use' away, imo
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:56:38] What BSD was that?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:56:50] this was a freebsd box
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[15:57:14] i remember i had to use gmake as well
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:57:27] That was an ooold version
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:57:39] Now ZNC checks if make or gmake should be used, and tells so
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[15:58:06] But with --with... We would need to do the same to all other external stuff we use?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:01:05] you mean like add params for python, perl, etc? no i do not think that is necessary
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:01:15] Apparently, since ZNC started to tell the command how to build, noone appeared on IRC with question "make shows strange error"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:01:37] And why is it necessary for ssl?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:01:54] ssl is for security, it is a 'deal breaker' if it is not installed. the other things are just features
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:03:42] DGandalf: out of curiousity, what is really gained by dropping --with-openssl?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:03:44] o.O
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:04:26] nate: users who are trying to use it in configure on normal OSes where libssl is findable by default
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:05:53] There are lots of people who turn every possible flag on, even if it has sane defaults, and if they don't really need effect of that flag
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:05:55] I think that's just a habitual thing really, people may not expect znc to load openssl by default (like a lot of things still need --with-openssl to do so), what's it hurt though if they do?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:06:13] like if they do --with-openssl isn't effectively the same as default (it just searches the default paths)?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:06:17] What are those other things?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:06:41] I've never saw it outside of ZNC
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:06:47] well i have been using znc for a bit, so ui  have old habits
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:06:56] habits bc i had to use them
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:07:01] a lot of the web tech I use offhand still require openssl enabled by that as far as I recall
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:07:10] but like me, other old users will learn that it works better now
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:07:11] PHP, lighttpd, pretty sure apache and nginx too
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:07:19] you dont need to express every parameter
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[16:07:42] hm, ok
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:07:57] ^
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:08:36] Most will simply treat --with-* as "search the common paths" anyways, I mean maybe make some kind of note that znc automatically tries to include openssl even without --with-openssl
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:09:01] there are notes in configure about it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[16:09:06] or change the --with-openssl flag to --with-openssl-dir instead (which is what things usually do if something is enabled by default but the path might be different, they do --with-*-dir=)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:09:15] i just ignored them, bc of my previous usage
2014-01-28 20:57:10	waterm3l0	[16:10:12] i like the dir idea
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ZNCLinker	[16:10:26] [znc] DarthGandalf pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DrNoxg

2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:31:06] can somebody help me to make an irc bouncer?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	haltdef	[21:32:23] just install znc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:34:52] haltdef: i am using windows
2014-01-28 20:57:10	haltdef	[21:35:09] that's fine, there's a windows port of znc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:35:56] could you provide me a link?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[21:36:30] !win

2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[21:38:46] Tested that one yesterday did not work good on Windows 2012 :
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:45:57] when I shut down my notebook to stay connected on some channels
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:48:04] you haven't provided me link with znc.exe
2014-01-28 20:57:10	haltdef	[21:48:47] you'll need to install it on a pc that you don't turn off ¬¬
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:49:47] i see, the pc would be server
2014-01-28 20:57:10	lite	[21:50:40] in that case, can i find free bnc online?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[21:51:22] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers
2014-01-28 20:57:10	haltdef	[21:51:52] just run it on a raspberry pi or something
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[21:59:42] are there downloadable skins for znc?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:00:24] I can only hope you mean the webclient else...
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:00:27] er webadmin
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:00:50] yes
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:00:55] what else is there?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:00:58] =P
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:01:21] just making sure, I mean, there ARE weird people on the internet, maybe there's one somewhere who thinks the znc app itself has skins
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:01:31] hehe
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:01:37] as for their being skins, I have no idea
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:02:08] i only found one, but it is ugly
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:02:26] http://userstyles.org/styles/49994/znc-orange
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:02:29] tbh I didn't even think it was a skinnable kind of thing but
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:03:16] uh, apparently that entire thing is done using in-browser overrides, so, lol
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:03:20] not sure I'd call that a skin
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:05:15] ah, only looked at the gif
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:05:16] =P
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:05:30] maybe it is time to make one
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:05:32] yeah it requires either stylish or greasemonkey basically, so it's only doing it in your specific browser
2014-01-28 20:57:10	nate	[22:05:52] you'd have to all in all look at the webadmin source, I'm not sure it's really configured for style/skin swapping
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:06:15] i think i can hack my way trough it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ArcAngel	[22:06:28] edit sources to add a theme
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[03:44:12] hehe
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[03:44:15] i don´t like that
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[03:44:26] psychon: why is it not possible to change name on network while you have set it+
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[03:44:35] "once you set it"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:46:00] why is there no "rename user" functionality? :-P
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:46:16] mostly because of paths in ~/.znc/users/foo/network/bar
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:46:27] too easy to have stuff still save to the previous location
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[03:46:38] there are lots of places where those paths are/can be saved
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[05:05:32] psychon: maybe something to add
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[05:05:35] thats bugging me i abit
2014-01-28 20:57:10	Whiskey-	[05:08:38] why is it not in the webinterface?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	 *	psychon [05:09:37] looks around
2014-01-28 20:57:10	 *	psychon [05:09:43] checks under the carpet
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@psychon	[05:09:46] sorry, who is "it"?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:20:52] DGandalf i downloaded 1.2
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:21:11] That could not be error from 1.2
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:21:39] You have several ZNCs around?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:22:10] no
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:22:35] check /msg *status version
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:43:35] ahh i see, the box is running the old version already
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[05:44:10] :p
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:49:59] have to get the owner to update it or something
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:50:16] Or install 1.2 yourself
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:50:38] i thought thats what i did lastnight, but it still used the version the box is running
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:50:50] i'm still a noob to linux lol
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:51:06] Well, I don't know what did you do.. so
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:52:26] i did everything the wiki says, but when you put "znc --makeconf" it installs the version the box is running
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:52:32] so thats why i was using the old one
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:53:08] make install told you what exact command you need to run
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:53:13] Probably it's not just "znc"
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[05:53:22] /blah/blah/znc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[05:54:34] ok
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@fred	[06:02:53] right XeroXed 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:03:02] awesome, its working
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@fred	[06:03:09] ofc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ZNCLinker	[06:14:46] [znc] DarthGandalf closed issue #412: Exploit in privmessage causes memory-leak http://git.io/BqADmg
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:22:07] hrm, now i can connect to the webadmin page but the via irc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:22:08] lol
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:41:11] I asked this yesterday, but I got the answer OnJoin() which is for when someone joins. Is there an event for when znc joins a channel?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:41:57] Compare nick
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:42:16] What do you mean?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:42:30] You receive nick who joined the channel
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:42:33] in OnJoin()
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:42:39] ZNC knows own nick
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:42:48] You may check if it was you who joined
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:42:58] Ah, right, I get it.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:43:00] Thanks a lot.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:43:12] If you want when user sends /join, it's another callback
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:43:33] Just for reference, what is that?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:44:06] Check Modules.h, there is the list
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:44:14] :P
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:46:50] OnUserJoin maybe?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	n00b592	[06:47:17] Yeah, it is. Thanks.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:47:49] any idea why its saying ssl isn't enabled?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:48:09] You need libssl-dev installed on debian for that
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:48:25] ok
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:48:34] Which may be installed by owner of that box
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:49:02] i don't have root access
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:50:57] another issue, it doesn't seem to be saving on the webadmin panel when i add irc servers
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:51:17] why not?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:51:37] not sure, i click edit after i save it and nothing is there
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:55:08] what do you add there?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:55:22] efnet.xs4all.nl +6697
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:55:36] But you compiled without SSL support
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:55:53] hrm, so i need to recompile it
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:56:17] Either make sure that libssl-dev installed and recompile, or don't use ssl
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[06:57:13] it should be installed, ssl was working on the older version
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:58:37] Runtime dependencies are different from build dependencies
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[06:59:03] libssl binary is installed, sure. But to build, you need both binary and headers
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@DGandalf	[07:02:27] Or you can try to install openssl yourself, but better just ask owner to install -dev
2014-01-28 20:57:10	XeroXed	[07:09:02] oh well, i give up lol
2014-01-28 20:57:10	 *	drbean [10:21:03] tap, taps microphone.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:22:46] I wonder if my problems connecting to ZNC on 6666 is related to command & control server use of IRC on 6666 to control bots.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:25:35] efnet was temporarily k-lining an IP through which my connection to ZNC was routed.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:26:34] On port 6666.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:28:26] I wonder what the sysadmins at my school have been doing. 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:29:15] evidently not their job
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:29:36] Traceroute to the ZNC IP * * *'s out when it reaches the first IP in the school block.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:30:19] They know very little about IRC, but more about infected machines, he-he.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:32:01] http://cbl.abuseat.org/advanced.html says: simply looking for IRC connections that you're not expecting (port 6666) will ...
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:32:52] I though 6666 was a good port for clients to connect to ZNC, and have ZNC connect to IRC on 6667.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:33:47] Perhaps the sysadmins blacklisted clients.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:34:16] Do I have to run client-ZNC connections on different ports to the ZNC-IRC ones?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:39:13] I assumed they had to be different, but perhaps that's incorrect.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:40:14] no
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:40:24] that port is irrelevant of any outgoing connections
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:40:46] Connection to the webadmin web server and ZNC are run on the same port, so perhaps client-ZNC and ZNC-IRC connections can be run on the same port.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[10:41:10] So, I can run them on the same port?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:41:31] the listening port (for connecting to znc) is completely different than the irc ports (which are listening ports on the irc server)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:42:27] yes you can use an irc port for znc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:42:43] and then connect to another address that uses that same port
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:42:53] it's the equivalent of connecting to different websites
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:43:00] they all use port 80/443
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[10:43:09] but you could run your own local webserver on 80 & 443
2014-01-28 20:57:10	 *	drbean [10:43:49] sees light go on.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[11:08:29] I try that on the webadmin web page and *status, but get the message: 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[11:08:41] addport 6667 ipv4 all Unable to bind [Address already in use]
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[11:10:28] 6667 is the address that ZNC connects to freenode:
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[11:10:32] | chat.freenode.net* | 6667 |     |      |
2014-01-28 20:57:10	SourceX	[11:11:43] something else on that machine is using port 6667 then
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[13:02:14] gotcha, bitlbee.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[13:26:01] at biltbee.org: ".. if you're already running an IRC server on your machine, you probably have   to change the port number BitlBee listens on. " !!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	drbean	[13:28:40] BUt now I broke Bitlbee.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[16:54:05] yes, assuming something has been added to the buffer
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:09:00] hello all
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:09:03] anyone there?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	ZNCLinker	[18:09:03] Pointless question detected! imereli, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you have checked http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ first. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html Sorry if this is a false alarm.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	KindOne	[18:09:10] bahahah I love that bot

2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:19:08] ZNC 0.202 - win-x86
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[18:37:24] imereli: did you install all the prerequirements? http://code.google.com/p/znc-msvc/wiki/StarterGuide
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:50:14] yes!!!!!!!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:50:19] i am in znc now!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:50:54] imereli is ~imereli@89.232.22.174 * Got ZNC?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:51:15] can i change this hostname?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:51:22] i mean  ~imereli@89.232.22.174 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[18:52:03] you can change the ident part before the @
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[18:52:22] the hostname is always the name or ip of the machine that is connecting to irc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:52:28] aaaa
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[18:53:13] thx leo!!! super help
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:00:08] My patience is running out, NOW!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:00:26] difference between znc & mirc... for what i need ZNC when i can join from mIRC
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:02:12] If you don't know, you don't need it. Also see the ZNC Wiki for more information.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:03:02] gmh i just see youtube tutorial thats why i decide make znc.. but if u can tell me in one word...any special action with znc..
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:03:34] i know whats BNC/Psybnc doing but ZNC doing same?? for exmaple if i`ll quit from IRC will my nickname still be online?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:04:14] Yes, it is a bouncer (bnc) like psyBNC, but better.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:04:27] wow!!!!!! i was wondering that!!!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:04:36] you are super!!!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	trist4n	[19:05:23] wow!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:06:56] trist4n: indeed :)
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:07:02] gmh
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:07:08] imereli?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:07:28] and if i turn off my pc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:07:38] my nickname still will be online?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:08:16] if the znc is not hosted on your machine, yes
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:08:59] i think its hosted on my pc :D localhost:port
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:10:46] Then its not magical, it will go down with your pc and your "nickname" will disconnect.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:11:15] and can u give me some advance how i must host on other something...is any tutorial?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:11:29] i dont want to be hosted on my machine
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:12:09] what i need for this
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:30:50] A dedicated computer (old laptop, RaspberryPi etc) that can be on 24/7 if you want to host it yourself. You can also pay for a Shell Account / VPS / Dedicated Server and host it at someone who specialize in it.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:31:29] thx very much!
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:32:43] For any more questions about hosting a linux server join #linux
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:32:47] and when  i pay for shell account i can set my domain like your? gmh@irc.hinderaker.com 
2014-01-28 20:57:10	gmh	[19:33:04] if you have a domain and you pay extra for personal vhost
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:33:10] aha understood
2014-01-28 20:57:10	imereli	[19:33:15] was super help! thx very much
2014-01-28 20:57:10	negij	[20:00:15] guys, may I ask you a confirm that BufferDimension 1000 is 1mb ?
2014-01-28 20:57:10	negij	[20:13:06] buffer count ..
2014-01-28 20:57:10	negij	[20:13:16] dimension of the buffer when you are not logged into the znc
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[20:19:36] right, it's a buffer of lines, the size you can set is the max amount of lines in the buffer.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[20:21:07] since the lines are variable in length, you can't say how many bytes it uses.
2014-01-28 20:57:10	@SilverLeo	[20:27:05] yes in znc memory. if you want logs in file, use a logging module
2014-01-28 20:57:10	negij	[20:27:19] [13:24] <imereli> than fack off :* thats not your busines why i am on irc

2014-01-29 00:48:50	lite	i got bouncer and i don't know how to get it going on my client
2014-01-29 00:48:57	lite	can you help me?

2014-01-29 00:56:46	lite	you can also suggest me another client as long as it helps me to set it up
2014-01-29 00:57:02	@SilverLeo	i have no idea how icechat handles bnc stuff, but if you enter the bnc details into the main settings you should be good. and add zncuser:zncpasswd as a server password which i guess would be on extra settings tab
2014-01-29 01:00:09	lite	what client are you using?
2014-01-29 01:00:39	@SilverLeo	i use weechat on a linux server
2014-01-29 01:01:56	lite	this is screenshot of extra setting tab: http://postimg.org/image/aneq4wkkh/
2014-01-29 01:02:29	@SilverLeo	yea, anter your znc login to the server password field as zncusername:zncpassword
2014-01-29 01:02:34	@SilverLeo	s/anter/enter/
2014-01-29 01:02:34	ZNCLinker	SilverLeo meant: “yea, enter your znc login to the server password field as zncusername:zncpassword”
2014-01-29 01:04:57	lite	i understand, it connects me with my bouncer but it's not related to efnet i want to be connected to
2014-01-29 01:05:21	@SilverLeo	right, then you connect your bouncer to efnet
2014-01-29 01:05:58	lite	that was the first idea in two screenshots above and its not working
2014-01-29 01:06:38	@SilverLeo	don't use the bnc stuff in your client unless it specifically says somewhere that it works with znc

2014-01-29 01:08:50	lite	looks like this works only with znc and my bouncer is not znc
2014-01-29 01:09:15	lite	why do they make rocket science out of it, damn
2014-01-29 01:13:48	@SilverLeo	it really isn't. your irc client thinks the bouncer is just another irc server. then you configure the bouncer separately once you've connected to it
2014-01-29 01:14:11	@SilverLeo	but since you said your bnc isn't znc i can only suggest in this #znc channel that you get znc

2014-01-29 03:33:25	Han`	rataplan... and the question is...?
2014-01-29 03:34:42	Kolga	well, i am using currently 1.1-git-74-81599fb. want to update to 1.2, should i only dl the lastet tarball, extract it and compile it via make, make install?
2014-01-29 03:34:56	Kolga	or does it overwrite my current znc.conf?
2014-01-29 03:35:36	Han`	copy your conf and try it
2014-01-29 03:36:08	Kolga	k, compiling it atm
2014-01-29 03:36:33	Kolga	i guess i have to stop znc first before make install, right?
2014-01-29 03:36:42	Han`	nope
2014-01-29 03:36:58	Han`	you can install and when is finished, restart the znc
2014-01-29 03:37:29	Kolga	fine
2014-01-29 03:37:30	Han`	when you are on a NIX system
2014-01-29 03:37:39	Kolga	using debian
2014-01-29 03:37:48	Han`	will work fine
2014-01-29 03:39:20	Kolga	yeh, just checked the FAQ again
2014-01-29 03:39:25	Kolga	restart should do the job
2014-01-29 03:39:41	Han`	sure

2014-01-29 06:14:23	n00b890	uh.
2014-01-29 06:14:43	n00b890	So I've got .Split(), then I check if (split[2] != "")
2014-01-29 06:14:49	n00b890	but that brings a segmentation fault o_O
2014-01-29 06:15:35	@DGandalf	did you check size of vector?
2014-01-29 06:15:58	n00b890	It's got more than one value
2014-01-29 06:16:06	n00b890	but that line is empty
2014-01-29 06:16:07	@DGandalf	2 is more than one
2014-01-29 06:16:11	n00b890	but I thought 
2014-01-29 06:16:19	n00b890	since I'm doing != "" it'll not go any further
2014-01-29 06:16:35	n00b890	I'm also doing if (CString(*it) == "") { continue; } 
2014-01-29 06:16:42	n00b890	Oh wait.
2014-01-29 06:16:44	n00b890	Derp. 
2014-01-29 06:16:51	n00b890	Nevermind, I confused myself.
2014-01-29 06:17:00	@DGandalf	Right, you can't dereference invalid iterators
2014-01-29 06:17:25	@DGandalf	And you can't use [] to get element outside of range of vector
2014-01-29 06:17:38	@DGandalf	And check http://en.cppreference.com/w/
2014-01-29 06:17:51	n00b890	Wait, do you mean check the size of the VCString?
2014-01-29 06:18:11	n00b890	Then depending on the size, split accordingly?
2014-01-29 06:18:16	@DGandalf	If vector has 2 elements, you can't get the third one

2014-01-29 23:21:52	n00b735	Why does this throw a segmentation fault error? http://pastebin.com/zzeHGTcA
2014-01-29 23:22:25	@psychoff	you don't happen to know where exactly it crashes?
2014-01-29 23:22:30	@psychoff	if you just want me to guess:
2014-01-29 23:22:51	@psychoff	either because m_pNetwork is NULL or because you don't have a return; after the PutModule() and actually do something with the channel afterwards
2014-01-29 23:27:29	n00b735	Weird. So I was basically calling it in "OnLoad", but if I call it somewhere else (e.g. a command) then it works
2014-01-29 23:27:43	@psychoff	this is a network module?
2014-01-29 23:28:13	n00b735	When it loads (the module), I want it to run through  the channel of users
2014-01-29 23:28:16	n00b735	What do you mean?
2014-01-29 23:28:21	n00b735	users in a chan*
2014-01-29 23:28:48	@psychoff	a module can be loaded as a global module, user module or network module
2014-01-29 23:28:54	@psychoff	only in the later case is m_pNetwork set
2014-01-29 23:29:22	n00b735	Do you mean where we call the class?
2014-01-29 23:29:33	n00b735	Like class CTestM : public CModule {
2014-01-29 23:33:36	n00b735	If that's not what you mean, I'm not sure what I'm calling it as
2014-01-29 23:39:34	@SilverLeo	n00b735: usually you set the defaukt type with a xxMODULEDEFS( line at the end
2014-01-29 23:41:28	n00b735	Only what I have is USERMODULEDEFS(CTestM, "module")
2014-01-29 23:42:15	@SilverLeo	right, it's a User module
2014-01-29 23:42:43	@SilverLeo	at OnLoad it doesn't know what m_pNetwork is since it's not loaded in a network context
2014-01-29 23:43:03	n00b735	Would I make it NETWORKMODULEDFS?

2014-01-30 04:57:29	n00b873	I asked earlier but nobody answered, I was here for a few hours I believe.
2014-01-30 04:57:34	n00b873	But. This will explain more.
2014-01-30 04:58:02	@psychoff	with a different number?
2014-01-30 04:59:18	n00b873	probably
2014-01-30 04:59:39	n00b873	Okay, here: http://pastebin.com/Xa4Gam0S
2014-01-30 04:59:43	n00b873	The error is in the comments at the top
2014-01-30 05:00:03	@psychoff	tried including User.h?
2014-01-30 05:03:36	n00b873	Lol, that did it.
2014-01-30 05:03:43	n00b873	Now for FindNetwork, does it need to include the port?
2014-01-30 05:03:54	@psychoff	uhm, what? which port?
2014-01-30 05:04:02	@psychoff	are you sure you know what a network in znc is?
2014-01-30 05:04:52	n00b873	It's what I got told to use anyway.. basically, that gets called with OnJoin, and because it's a user module it throws an error because m_pNetwork isn't set (I believe)
2014-01-30 05:05:01	n00b873	So I got told to instead of not wait for it to be set, set it myself with that
2014-01-30 05:05:23	@psychoff	I don't know what you are trying to do
2014-01-30 05:05:28	@psychoff	but in OnJoin, m_pNetwork is set
2014-01-30 05:05:34	@psychoff	what SilverLeo told you was about OnLoad
2014-01-30 05:05:41	n00b873	That's what I mean, sorry
2014-01-30 05:06:09	@psychoff	so, what are you actually trying to do?
2014-01-30 05:06:43	n00b873	Once the module is loaded, if in a certain chan (which is in ScanUsers()) then loop through the users
2014-01-30 05:06:53	@psychoff	hm, ok
2014-01-30 05:07:06	@psychoff	could you do /znc listnetworks?
2014-01-30 05:07:14	@psychoff	what does it list the network as in the first column?
2014-01-30 05:07:41	n00b873	Oh, that's what I should be using rather than the actual address?
2014-01-30 05:08:14	@psychoff	I'll let you figure that one out yourself
2014-01-30 05:08:16	@psychoff	good luck

2014-01-31 16:53:05	drbean	Is this on?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	***	Buffer Playback...
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:54:04] Hm, I'm for dropping --with-openssl. If ssl is installed in some weird path, user always can add PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS manually
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:54:27] to env
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:54:53] i like the functionality, ive had shells on BSD boxes and needed to include it for configure to find openssl
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:55:16] Did you install openssl yourself there?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:55:30] no
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:55:37] What is the path?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:55:40] it was a shell ona box
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:55:53] i do not recall
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:56:37] forcing users to set environment variables takes a lot of the 'ease of use' away, imo
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:56:38] What BSD was that?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:56:50] this was a freebsd box
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[15:57:14] i remember i had to use gmake as well
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:57:27] That was an ooold version
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:57:39] Now ZNC checks if make or gmake should be used, and tells so
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[15:58:06] But with --with... We would need to do the same to all other external stuff we use?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:01:05] you mean like add params for python, perl, etc? no i do not think that is necessary
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:01:15] Apparently, since ZNC started to tell the command how to build, noone appeared on IRC with question "make shows strange error"
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:01:37] And why is it necessary for ssl?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:01:54] ssl is for security, it is a 'deal breaker' if it is not installed. the other things are just features
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:03:42] DGandalf: out of curiousity, what is really gained by dropping --with-openssl?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:03:44] o.O
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:04:26] nate: users who are trying to use it in configure on normal OSes where libssl is findable by default
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:05:53] There are lots of people who turn every possible flag on, even if it has sane defaults, and if they don't really need effect of that flag
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:05:55] I think that's just a habitual thing really, people may not expect znc to load openssl by default (like a lot of things still need --with-openssl to do so), what's it hurt though if they do?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:06:13] like if they do --with-openssl isn't effectively the same as default (it just searches the default paths)?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:06:17] What are those other things?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:06:41] I've never saw it outside of ZNC
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:06:47] well i have been using znc for a bit, so ui  have old habits
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:06:56] habits bc i had to use them
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:07:01] a lot of the web tech I use offhand still require openssl enabled by that as far as I recall
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:07:10] but like me, other old users will learn that it works better now
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:07:11] PHP, lighttpd, pretty sure apache and nginx too
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:07:19] you dont need to express every parameter
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[16:07:42] hm, ok
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:07:57] ^
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:08:36] Most will simply treat --with-* as "search the common paths" anyways, I mean maybe make some kind of note that znc automatically tries to include openssl even without --with-openssl
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:09:01] there are notes in configure about it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[16:09:06] or change the --with-openssl flag to --with-openssl-dir instead (which is what things usually do if something is enabled by default but the path might be different, they do --with-*-dir=)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:09:15] i just ignored them, bc of my previous usage
2014-01-31 16:53:30	waterm3l0	[16:10:12] i like the dir idea
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[16:10:26] [znc] DarthGandalf pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DrNoxg

2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:31:06] can somebody help me to make an irc bouncer?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	haltdef	[21:32:23] just install znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:34:52] haltdef: i am using windows
2014-01-31 16:53:30	haltdef	[21:35:09] that's fine, there's a windows port of znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:35:56] could you provide me a link?

2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[21:38:46] Tested that one yesterday did not work good on Windows 2012 :
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:45:57] when I shut down my notebook to stay connected on some channels
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:48:04] you haven't provided me link with znc.exe
2014-01-31 16:53:30	haltdef	[21:48:47] you'll need to install it on a pc that you don't turn off ¬¬
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:49:47] i see, the pc would be server
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[21:50:40] in that case, can i find free bnc online?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[21:51:22] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers
2014-01-31 16:53:30	haltdef	[21:51:52] just run it on a raspberry pi or something
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[21:59:42] are there downloadable skins for znc?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:00:24] I can only hope you mean the webclient else...
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:00:27] er webadmin
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:00:50] yes
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:00:55] what else is there?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:00:58] =P
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:01:21] just making sure, I mean, there ARE weird people on the internet, maybe there's one somewhere who thinks the znc app itself has skins
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:01:31] hehe
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:01:37] as for their being skins, I have no idea
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:02:08] i only found one, but it is ugly
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:02:26] http://userstyles.org/styles/49994/znc-orange
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:02:29] tbh I didn't even think it was a skinnable kind of thing but
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:03:16] uh, apparently that entire thing is done using in-browser overrides, so, lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:03:20] not sure I'd call that a skin
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:05:15] ah, only looked at the gif
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:05:16] =P
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:05:30] maybe it is time to make one
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:05:32] yeah it requires either stylish or greasemonkey basically, so it's only doing it in your specific browser
2014-01-31 16:53:30	nate	[22:05:52] you'd have to all in all look at the webadmin source, I'm not sure it's really configured for style/skin swapping
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:06:15] i think i can hack my way trough it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ArcAngel	[22:06:28] edit sources to add a theme
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[03:44:12] hehe
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[03:44:15] i don´t like that
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[03:44:26] psychon: why is it not possible to change name on network while you have set it+
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[03:44:35] "once you set it"
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[03:46:00] why is there no "rename user" functionality? :-P
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[03:46:16] mostly because of paths in ~/.znc/users/foo/network/bar
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[03:46:27] too easy to have stuff still save to the previous location
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[03:46:38] there are lots of places where those paths are/can be saved
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[05:05:32] psychon: maybe something to add
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[05:05:35] thats bugging me i abit
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Whiskey-	[05:08:38] why is it not in the webinterface?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	 *	psychon [05:09:37] looks around
2014-01-31 16:53:30	 *	psychon [05:09:43] checks under the carpet
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[05:09:46] sorry, who is "it"?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:20:52] DGandalf i downloaded 1.2
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:21:11] That could not be error from 1.2
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:21:39] You have several ZNCs around?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:22:10] no
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:22:35] check /msg *status version
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:43:35] ahh i see, the box is running the old version already
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[05:44:10] :p
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:49:59] have to get the owner to update it or something
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:50:16] Or install 1.2 yourself
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:50:38] i thought thats what i did lastnight, but it still used the version the box is running
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:50:50] i'm still a noob to linux lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:51:06] Well, I don't know what did you do.. so
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:52:26] i did everything the wiki says, but when you put "znc --makeconf" it installs the version the box is running
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:52:32] so thats why i was using the old one
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:53:08] make install told you what exact command you need to run
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:53:13] Probably it's not just "znc"
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:53:22] /blah/blah/znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[05:54:34] ok
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[06:02:53] right XeroXed 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:03:02] awesome, its working
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[06:03:09] ofc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[06:14:46] [znc] DarthGandalf closed issue #412: Exploit in privmessage causes memory-leak http://git.io/BqADmg
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:22:07] hrm, now i can connect to the webadmin page but the via irc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:22:08] lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:41:11] I asked this yesterday, but I got the answer OnJoin() which is for when someone joins. Is there an event for when znc joins a channel?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:41:57] Compare nick
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:42:16] What do you mean?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:42:30] You receive nick who joined the channel
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:42:33] in OnJoin()
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:42:39] ZNC knows own nick
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:42:48] You may check if it was you who joined
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:42:58] Ah, right, I get it.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:43:00] Thanks a lot.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:43:12] If you want when user sends /join, it's another callback
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:43:33] Just for reference, what is that?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:44:06] Check Modules.h, there is the list
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:44:14] :P
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:46:50] OnUserJoin maybe?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b592	[06:47:17] Yeah, it is. Thanks.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:47:49] any idea why its saying ssl isn't enabled?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:48:09] You need libssl-dev installed on debian for that
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:48:25] ok
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:48:34] Which may be installed by owner of that box
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:49:02] i don't have root access
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:50:57] another issue, it doesn't seem to be saving on the webadmin panel when i add irc servers
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:51:17] why not?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:51:37] not sure, i click edit after i save it and nothing is there
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:55:08] what do you add there?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:55:22] efnet.xs4all.nl +6697
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:55:36] But you compiled without SSL support
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:55:53] hrm, so i need to recompile it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:56:17] Either make sure that libssl-dev installed and recompile, or don't use ssl
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[06:57:13] it should be installed, ssl was working on the older version
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:58:37] Runtime dependencies are different from build dependencies
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:59:03] libssl binary is installed, sure. But to build, you need both binary and headers
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[07:02:27] Or you can try to install openssl yourself, but better just ask owner to install -dev
2014-01-31 16:53:30	XeroXed	[07:09:02] oh well, i give up lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	 *	drbean [10:21:03] tap, taps microphone.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:22:46] I wonder if my problems connecting to ZNC on 6666 is related to command & control server use of IRC on 6666 to control bots.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:25:35] efnet was temporarily k-lining an IP through which my connection to ZNC was routed.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:26:34] On port 6666.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:28:26] I wonder what the sysadmins at my school have been doing. 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:29:15] evidently not their job
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:29:36] Traceroute to the ZNC IP * * *'s out when it reaches the first IP in the school block.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:30:19] They know very little about IRC, but more about infected machines, he-he.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:32:01] http://cbl.abuseat.org/advanced.html says: simply looking for IRC connections that you're not expecting (port 6666) will ...
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:32:52] I though 6666 was a good port for clients to connect to ZNC, and have ZNC connect to IRC on 6667.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:33:47] Perhaps the sysadmins blacklisted clients.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:34:16] Do I have to run client-ZNC connections on different ports to the ZNC-IRC ones?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:39:13] I assumed they had to be different, but perhaps that's incorrect.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:40:14] no
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:40:24] that port is irrelevant of any outgoing connections
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:40:46] Connection to the webadmin web server and ZNC are run on the same port, so perhaps client-ZNC and ZNC-IRC connections can be run on the same port.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[10:41:10] So, I can run them on the same port?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:41:31] the listening port (for connecting to znc) is completely different than the irc ports (which are listening ports on the irc server)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:42:27] yes you can use an irc port for znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:42:43] and then connect to another address that uses that same port
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:42:53] it's the equivalent of connecting to different websites
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:43:00] they all use port 80/443
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[10:43:09] but you could run your own local webserver on 80 & 443
2014-01-31 16:53:30	 *	drbean [10:43:49] sees light go on.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[11:08:29] I try that on the webadmin web page and *status, but get the message: 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[11:08:41] addport 6667 ipv4 all Unable to bind [Address already in use]
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[11:10:28] 6667 is the address that ZNC connects to freenode:
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[11:10:32] | chat.freenode.net* | 6667 |     |      |
2014-01-31 16:53:30	SourceX	[11:11:43] something else on that machine is using port 6667 then
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[13:02:14] gotcha, bitlbee.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[13:26:01] at biltbee.org: ".. if you're already running an IRC server on your machine, you probably have   to change the port number BitlBee listens on. " !!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	drbean	[13:28:40] BUt now I broke Bitlbee.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[16:54:05] yes, assuming something has been added to the buffer
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:09:00] hello all
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:09:03] anyone there?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[18:09:03] Pointless question detected! imereli, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you have checked http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ first. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html Sorry if this is a false alarm.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	KindOne	[18:09:10] bahahah I love that bot

2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:19:08] ZNC 0.202 - win-x86
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:37:24] imereli: did you install all the prerequirements? http://code.google.com/p/znc-msvc/wiki/StarterGuide
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:50:14] yes!!!!!!!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:50:19] i am in znc now!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:50:54] imereli is ~imereli@89.232.22.174 * Got ZNC?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:51:15] can i change this hostname?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:51:22] i mean  ~imereli@89.232.22.174 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:52:03] you can change the ident part before the @
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:52:22] the hostname is always the name or ip of the machine that is connecting to irc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:52:28] aaaa
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[18:53:13] thx leo!!! super help
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:00:08] My patience is running out, NOW!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:00:26] difference between znc & mirc... for what i need ZNC when i can join from mIRC
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:02:12] If you don't know, you don't need it. Also see the ZNC Wiki for more information.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:03:02] gmh i just see youtube tutorial thats why i decide make znc.. but if u can tell me in one word...any special action with znc..
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:03:34] i know whats BNC/Psybnc doing but ZNC doing same?? for exmaple if i`ll quit from IRC will my nickname still be online?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:04:14] Yes, it is a bouncer (bnc) like psyBNC, but better.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:04:27] wow!!!!!! i was wondering that!!!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:04:36] you are super!!!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	trist4n	[19:05:23] wow!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:06:56] trist4n: indeed :)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:07:02] gmh
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:07:08] imereli?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:07:28] and if i turn off my pc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:07:38] my nickname still will be online?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:08:16] if the znc is not hosted on your machine, yes
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:08:59] i think its hosted on my pc :D localhost:port
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:10:46] Then its not magical, it will go down with your pc and your "nickname" will disconnect.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:11:15] and can u give me some advance how i must host on other something...is any tutorial?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:11:29] i dont want to be hosted on my machine
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:12:09] what i need for this
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:30:50] A dedicated computer (old laptop, RaspberryPi etc) that can be on 24/7 if you want to host it yourself. You can also pay for a Shell Account / VPS / Dedicated Server and host it at someone who specialize in it.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:31:29] thx very much!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:32:43] For any more questions about hosting a linux server join #linux
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:32:47] and when  i pay for shell account i can set my domain like your? gmh@irc.hinderaker.com 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	gmh	[19:33:04] if you have a domain and you pay extra for personal vhost
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:33:10] aha understood
2014-01-31 16:53:30	imereli	[19:33:15] was super help! thx very much
2014-01-31 16:53:30	negij	[20:00:15] guys, may I ask you a confirm that BufferDimension 1000 is 1mb ?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	negij	[20:13:06] buffer count ..
2014-01-31 16:53:30	negij	[20:13:16] dimension of the buffer when you are not logged into the znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[20:19:36] right, it's a buffer of lines, the size you can set is the max amount of lines in the buffer.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[20:21:07] since the lines are variable in length, you can't say how many bytes it uses.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[20:27:05] yes in znc memory. if you want logs in file, use a logging module
2014-01-31 16:53:30	negij	[20:27:19] [13:24] <imereli> than fack off :* thats not your busines why i am on irc

2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[00:57:02] i have no idea how icechat handles bnc stuff, but if you enter the bnc details into the main settings you should be good. and add zncuser:zncpasswd as a server password which i guess would be on extra settings tab
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:00:09] what client are you using?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:00:39] i use weechat on a linux server
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:01:56] this is screenshot of extra setting tab: http://postimg.org/image/aneq4wkkh/
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:02:29] yea, anter your znc login to the server password field as zncusername:zncpassword
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:02:34] s/anter/enter/
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[01:02:34] SilverLeo meant: “yea, enter your znc login to the server password field as zncusername:zncpassword”
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:04:57] i understand, it connects me with my bouncer but it's not related to efnet i want to be connected to
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:05:21] right, then you connect your bouncer to efnet
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:05:58] that was the first idea in two screenshots above and its not working
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:06:38] don't use the bnc stuff in your client unless it specifically says somewhere that it works with znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:07:00] just connect to znc and then /msg *status addserver irc.efnet.org etc.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:08:50] looks like this works only with znc and my bouncer is not znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite	[01:09:15] why do they make rocket science out of it, damn
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:13:48] it really isn't. your irc client thinks the bouncer is just another irc server. then you configure the bouncer separately once you've connected to it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[01:14:11] but since you said your bnc isn't znc i can only suggest in this #znc channel that you get znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite_	[01:20:59] actually it is ZNC!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	lite_	[01:21:17] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers

2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:31:05] yo, have a question, regarding updating my current znc installation
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:33:25] rataplan... and the question is...?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:34:42] well, i am using currently 1.1-git-74-81599fb. want to update to 1.2, should i only dl the lastet tarball, extract it and compile it via make, make install?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:34:56] or does it overwrite my current znc.conf?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:35:36] copy your conf and try it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:36:08] k, compiling it atm
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:36:33] i guess i have to stop znc first before make install, right?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:36:42] nope
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:36:58] you can install and when is finished, restart the znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:37:29] fine
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:37:30] when you are on a NIX system
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:37:39] using debian
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:37:48] will work fine
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:39:20] yeh, just checked the FAQ again
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Kolga	[03:39:25] restart should do the job
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Han`	[03:39:41] sure
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[05:37:19] [znc] DarthGandalf opened issue #476: Separate CXXFLAGS from LDFLAGS/LIBS for modules http://git.io/43HYzw
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:37:26] fred: ^^
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:38:11] thx ,)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@psychon	[05:38:22] but... MODFLAGS! ;-)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:14:23] uh.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:14:43] So I've got .Split(), then I check if (split[2] != "")
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:14:49] but that brings a segmentation fault o_O
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:15:35] did you check size of vector?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:15:58] It's got more than one value
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:06] but that line is empty
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:16:07] 2 is more than one
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:11] but I thought 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:19] since I'm doing != "" it'll not go any further
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:35] I'm also doing if (CString(*it) == "") { continue; } 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:42] Oh wait.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:44] Derp. 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:16:51] Nevermind, I confused myself.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:17:00] Right, you can't dereference invalid iterators
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:17:25] And you can't use [] to get element outside of range of vector
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:17:38] And check http://en.cppreference.com/w/
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:17:51] Wait, do you mean check the size of the VCString?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:18:11] Then depending on the size, split accordingly?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:18:16] If vector has 2 elements, you can't get the third one
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:18:31] [2] returns you third element
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:18:41] Which doesn't exist if there are only two elements
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b890	[06:18:44] Understood. 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[06:20:44] Also gdb is useful to debug segfaults
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[17:49:01] hello all
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[17:49:29] i need few help about znc if anyone is not busy
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:09:39] aloo
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:10:17] you might get few help if you actually asked something specific
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:10:29] yeah 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:10:43] id est i installed znc on my computer
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:10:51] working normal
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:11:02] but iwant change vhost
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:11:29] like @ilovenz.com.biz or something like this
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:11:47] the [[FAQ]] has an entry on that
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[18:11:48] http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:11:51] i dont know how i must to do this...i have website and cpanel too
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:12:25] when i tried setvhost mywebsite.com its not working
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:13:04] so you're running znc on the same server that runs yourwebsite.com ?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:13:23] no and thats i dont understand how to install znc on mywebsite:)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:13:52] i need to instal znc on mywebsite... but i dont know how need some advance
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:14:21] what kind of webhosting is it? do you have shell access to it?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:14:44] no its free domain website...with big cpanel
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:14:59] then i would bet you can't install znc there
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:15:21] id est my website need shell there?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:16:24] znc needs to be running on the server that has the ip you want to use for your vhost, just like the FAQ says
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:17:32] ok ty SilverLeo
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:27:56] SilverLeo one question again for example i get shell acc on my website.. how i must install znc there? is any tutorial? or commands? or it just simply command on like my computer?

2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:40:12] SilverLeo oh i forgot to say
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:41:02] i am not using znc in fact........ i am using znc-msvc..(for windows xp) and will i have any problem to install it on my website server?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:41:35] cause link u gave me about instalation there is about linux ubuntu arclinus and something like this...
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[18:42:53] guess what operating system your website server is running?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:50:46] ah that depend on website system?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	rinber	[18:51:01] i think its windows simply windows7
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:41:58] guys how do I start znc ?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	tomaw	[22:42:40] in a terminal, type 'znc' and hit return
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:42:58] znc
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:43:33] hmm
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:43:34] wierd
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:43:37] command not found
2014-01-31 16:53:30	jason313	[22:43:38] :/
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:21:52] Why does this throw a segmentation fault error? http://pastebin.com/zzeHGTcA
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:22:25] you don't happen to know where exactly it crashes?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:22:30] if you just want me to guess:
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:22:51] either because m_pNetwork is NULL or because you don't have a return; after the PutModule() and actually do something with the channel afterwards
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:27:29] Weird. So I was basically calling it in "OnLoad", but if I call it somewhere else (e.g. a command) then it works
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:27:43] this is a network module?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:28:13] When it loads (the module), I want it to run through  the channel of users
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:28:16] What do you mean?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:28:21] users in a chan*
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:28:48] a module can be loaded as a global module, user module or network module
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[23:28:54] only in the later case is m_pNetwork set
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:29:22] Do you mean where we call the class?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:29:33] Like class CTestM : public CModule {
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:33:36] If that's not what you mean, I'm not sure what I'm calling it as
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[23:39:34] n00b735: usually you set the defaukt type with a xxMODULEDEFS( line at the end
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:41:28] Only what I have is USERMODULEDEFS(CTestM, "module")
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[23:42:15] right, it's a User module
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[23:42:43] at OnLoad it doesn't know what m_pNetwork is since it's not loaded in a network context
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:43:03] Would I make it NETWORKMODULEDFS?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:43:03] :x
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:43:09] defs* lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b735	[23:49:12] Or what would be the best way to keep it a usermoduledefs and set the m_pNetwork or something?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[23:51:24] Uh sorry, did anyone reply?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[00:27:22] Is there a way to wait for m_pNetwork to get set efficiently in a user module?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[00:30:50] don't wait for it, find it: pUser->FindNetwork(..
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[00:31:45] Would the arg be the address it's connecting to?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[00:55:01] Now I'm getting a CUser struct error: http://pastebin.com/qNP0VeKD
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[00:59:33] you should paste the full script and the full error you get if you want more than guesses
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[00:59:59]  error: invalid use of incomplete type ‘struct CUser’
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[01:00:03] which is on the CNetwork line

2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b409	[01:49:49] Nobody can help?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b481	[02:42:58] Can anyone help me with FindNetwork()?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:50:04] Anyone available for help?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[04:54:06] so many evil answers and so few apropriate ones...
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[04:54:07] !q n00b873 
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[04:54:07] n00b873, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you have checked http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ first. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:57:29] I asked earlier but nobody answered, I was here for a few hours I believe.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:57:34] But. This will explain more.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[04:58:02] with a different number?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:59:18] probably
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:59:39] Okay, here: http://pastebin.com/Xa4Gam0S
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[04:59:43] The error is in the comments at the top
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:00:03] tried including User.h?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:03:36] Lol, that did it.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:03:43] Now for FindNetwork, does it need to include the port?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:03:54] uhm, what? which port?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:04:02] are you sure you know what a network in znc is?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:04:52] It's what I got told to use anyway.. basically, that gets called with OnJoin, and because it's a user module it throws an error because m_pNetwork isn't set (I believe)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:05:01] So I got told to instead of not wait for it to be set, set it myself with that
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:05:23] I don't know what you are trying to do
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:05:28] but in OnJoin, m_pNetwork is set
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:05:34] what SilverLeo told you was about OnLoad
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:05:41] That's what I mean, sorry
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:06:09] so, what are you actually trying to do?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:06:43] Once the module is loaded, if in a certain chan (which is in ScanUsers()) then loop through the users
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:06:53] hm, ok
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:07:06] could you do /znc listnetworks?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:07:14] what does it list the network as in the first column?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:07:41] Oh, that's what I should be using rather than the actual address?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:08:14] I'll let you figure that one out yourself
2014-01-31 16:53:30	psychoff	[05:08:16] good luck
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b873	[05:08:33] :P thanks for your help
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[08:52:46] How can you check if the current user is OP in a channel? I see "HasPerm" with a nick, but there's nothing to show which channel it is, I need to know if they're op in a specific channel.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Aracat	[08:56:24] what i ended up doing is module.GetNetwork().FindChan().FindNick(...).GetPermStr()
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Aracat	[08:58:12] feeding appropriate args to FindChan and FindNick
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[08:59:26] Hmm. I'm getting an error. Let me show you.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[09:00:30] http://pastebin.com/bNNxR7ff
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Aracat	[09:01:55] oh. what i pasted was python, but the same idea holds
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[09:02:06] oh lol
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[09:03:35] I'm not sure, I'll wait for someone with experience with C++
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Aracat	[09:04:00] it's complaining because you're using . with a pointer instead of ->
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[09:06:53] Ah, sorted it. Thank you! :)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[09:15:00] n00b103: maybe you need to learn C++ before trying to use it to write something useful for ZNC?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b103	[10:10:44] I'm trying to learn. It's not like I'm making a module publicly, it's private and for me to learn C++. :S

2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ashmit	[00:09:43] whats the problem?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[00:10:33] DCC is the problem
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ashmit	[00:21:20] what is the solution
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b424	[01:32:59] Is there a way to send a command to another module as if it were yourself? Let's say I usually use "/msg *testmod cmd", can I do that from another module?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b424	[01:33:23] I tried PUTIRC("PRIVMSG *testmod cmd"); put that says no nick/chan
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[01:52:42] Hello - just learned about / set up znc, having trouble with webadmin
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[01:53:10] trying to connect with Chrome on port 1025 gives ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@flakes	[01:57:57] if you turned on SSL, try https:// instead of http://
2014-01-31 16:53:30	n00b179	[02:11:09] Is there a way to send a PRIVMSG to a module with another module?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	ZNCLinker	[02:40:12] [znc] TheWug opened pull request #477: Fixed issues brought up in IRC (master...master) http://git.io/yFhXdA
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:14:19] Thanks @flakes but SSL is off - and using https gives a timeout response instead of an empty response.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:34:31] Does the znc webadmin module have any log output?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:34:39] Oh, I could run it in the foreground.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:39:05] WebMod::Client == ReachedMaxBuffer()
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:39:24] not super useful output
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:39:51] there's a few other lines, but "max buffer" sounds problematic
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:41:25] derp, Firefox worked like a charm
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:41:34] I should have tried that hours ago - sorry!
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:42:10] I thought since I wasn't on an "unsafe port" it would be ok
2014-01-31 16:53:30	wfurr	[03:43:27] Have a nice day, all!

2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:49:10] Where can i download the old version?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:49:27] I dont like the new update with addnetwotk thing
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:50:21] ZNC 0.092+deb3 if possible
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:52:06] you may still have one network per user
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:52:49] Yeah but the web setup makes confusing dont like it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:52:57] ZNC 0.092+deb3 was better
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:53:23] You can just add the server add and thats all
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:53:45] Addnetwork is useless if you can still use 1 network
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:54:19] Correct me if im wrong ;)
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:54:23] you can use 1 network/user
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:54:31] just add several users like before
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@DGandalf	[05:54:41] You're right, GUI should be simplified for this use case
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:54:57] if they connect with user:pas - they connect the first irc -network
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:55:01] regardless of its name
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:56:01] Yeah i just like how ZNC 0.092+deb3 was made
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:56:12] Very simple and friendly interface
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:56:31] Fast to connect though using v6
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:56:55] The new versions takes too long to connect if you have sample 10 users on it
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[05:57:17] fred: yea, one can name the network IDontLikeNewThings and ride into the sunset on their big wheel bike
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:57:38] xD
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@fred	[05:57:47] i meant: he can use it like he did before
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:57:56] Ok is there a way i can download ZNC 0.092+deb3?
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[05:58:16] Ritche: if it takes long to connect then you didn't configure it like you want it to work
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[05:59:09] SilverLeo i did i think since they connect after some minutes
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[06:01:06] I wanted to install that version if you can give me the link thanks
2014-01-31 16:53:30	@SilverLeo	[06:02:34] with ConnectDelay = 1 and ServerThrottle = 30 you'll be connected within seconds. if not then you have other issues
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[06:03:28] Let me see.
2014-01-31 16:53:30	Ritche	[06:08:43] Ok got itbut there is no link for the oldversion?

2014-02-02 23:12:09	@psychon	can controlpanel/webadmin configure things? what would proper settings be for someone who had no problems before (= I guess znc should just treat everything as utf8)

2014-02-02 23:19:34	@psychon	and he receives http://i.imgur.com/VhVifRy.png
2014-02-02 23:20:07	@psychon	so something is taking utf8 and translates it into some other multi-byte encoding
2014-02-02 23:20:17	@DGandalf	what setting did he make?
2014-02-02 23:20:22	@psychon	none
2014-02-02 23:20:31	@psychon	someone else (offline) is running the znc instance
2014-02-02 23:20:52	@psychon	that person updated recently (online noticed due to the downtime) and now things are broken
2014-02-02 23:21:04	@psychon	and away was offline for a while and thus don
2014-02-02 23:21:19	@DGandalf	did he use charset module before?
2014-02-02 23:21:23	@psychon	*don't know how much stuff for webadmin/controlpanel is already in git/in that znc version
2014-02-02 23:21:29	@psychon	I dont think so
2014-02-02 23:21:57	@DGandalf	Then it should continue just working...
2014-02-02 23:22:08	@psychon	my guess was that the new encoding-stuff that I didn't really look at yet broke something
2014-02-02 23:22:17	@psychon	but since you know more about this than I do... :)
2014-02-02 23:22:26	@psychon	his reply: no charset in /znc listmods currently

2014-02-02 23:24:22	@DGandalf	And I tried to add it to webadmin too, but failed
2014-02-02 23:24:28	@DGandalf	Checkbox labels don't like me

2014-02-02 23:25:40	@psychon	what settings would you expect for encoding / clientencoding? (and why is encoding per-network, but clientencoding per-user?...)
2014-02-02 23:25:50	@DGandalf	empty
2014-02-02 23:26:08	@DGandalf	Because different network may have different encodings
2014-02-02 23:26:20	@DGandalf	And people use same clients to connect to all networks

2014-02-02 23:30:30	@psychon	does this need a /znc jump?
2014-02-02 23:30:40	@DGandalf	hmm.... maybe
2014-02-02 23:31:02	@DGandalf	I don't remember where that setting is applied to socket
2014-02-02 23:31:23	@psychon	CIRCSock's contructor does: SetEncoding(m_pNetwork->GetEncoding());
2014-02-02 23:31:45	@psychon	that's something that might be surprising and could need some fixing, IMO
2014-02-02 23:31:52	@DGandalf	yes
2014-02-02 23:32:00	@psychon	anyway: <DGandalf> I want to add some layer between Csocket and ZNC sockets
2014-02-02 23:32:18	@psychon	hm? what are you thinking of? don't we have a (very thin) layer called CZNCSocket already? ;-)
2014-02-02 23:32:42	@DGandalf	It's great that we have this layer
2014-02-02 23:33:16	@DGandalf	But it doesn't abstract Csocket away
2014-02-02 23:33:54	@psychon	just for the sake of abstraction or do you want to replace Csocket eventually?
2014-02-02 23:34:13	@DGandalf	Replace, yeh
2014-02-02 23:36:21	@psychon	any specific plans / complaints?

2014-02-02 23:36:59	@psychon	he says he has several networks, changed all of them to empty encoding, did /znc jump
2014-02-02 23:37:03	@DGandalf	weird
2014-02-02 23:37:29	@DGandalf	is clientenc empty? maybe it's something like space?
2014-02-02 23:37:45	@psychon	urgh :-P
2014-02-02 23:37:52	@psychon	what does it do with invalid values?
2014-02-02 23:38:12	@DGandalf	If it's empty, it doesn't apply any encoding to bytes
2014-02-02 23:38:28	@DGandalf	if not, it tries to create converter...

2014-02-02 23:38:44	@DGandalf	if that fails... the message is put to DEBUG
2014-02-02 23:39:14	@DGandalf	and probably it shouldn't do anything to bytes either
2014-02-02 23:39:35	@psychon	anyway, what are your plans with that csocket-abstraction? move the charset stuff in there?
2014-02-02 23:40:15	@DGandalf	I want more layering/callbackey structure.
2014-02-02 23:40:39	@DGandalf	Now Csocket does lots of stuff, and calls virtual Read()/ReadLine()
2014-02-02 23:41:07	@DGandalf	I had to add charset to that too
2014-02-02 23:41:26	@DGandalf	Was trying only at ZNC side at first, but it became too ugly
2014-02-02 23:42:08	@DGandalf	It would be good to have fd on the bottom, then ssl layer, then encoding layer, then ...
2014-02-02 23:42:13	@DGandalf	What other stuff it may need
2014-02-02 23:42:32	@DGandalf	\r\n is somewhere there

2014-02-02 23:43:31	@psychon	some source produces (=reads) bytes from the fd, some filter transform them
2014-02-02 23:43:42	@psychon	yeah, cat | sed -e 's/a/b/g' | etc...
2014-02-02 23:43:52	@DGandalf	pipes are unidirectional
2014-02-02 23:44:13	@psychon	only thing that really needs to be bidirectional would be SSL, I guess

2014-02-02 23:45:02	@DGandalf	Encoding too; or you would need to have separate encoders for in/out
2014-02-02 23:45:06	@DGandalf	Not sure if it's bad or good
2014-02-02 23:45:46	@psychon	since they do the opposite thing of each other anyway... ;-)
2014-02-02 23:46:22	@DGandalf	well, ssl encryption is opposite of ssl decryption, right? :P
2014-02-02 23:47:22	@psychon	true, but the state depends on both directions (well, the handshake...)
2014-02-02 23:47:49	@DGandalf	That said, I don't have the design of all this :)
2014-02-02 23:48:05	@psychon	I once worked on the m_ziplinks module for inspircd
2014-02-02 23:48:25	@psychon	that one had the problem that few bytes that it received could be decoded into something larger than the buffer that was given

2014-02-02 23:48:58	@psychon	there was no way with their design back then to fix this (and AFAIK m_ziplinks was dropped)
2014-02-02 23:49:07	@psychon	just so you know what things to avoid ;-)

2014-02-05 09:52:04	adde	i looked at the faq but didnt understand
2014-02-05 09:54:34	meingtsla	There are a bunch of ways to do it. I think the faq says how to use cron to do it, that's one way. You can also create an init script to start it, and have that init script start on boot. You could also add it to /etc/rc.local (depending on os/distro) as a quick hack

2014-02-07 22:40:29	n00b689	it doesnt mean if u read it that u understand it lol

2014-02-07 22:41:43	n00b689	its for a pickupchannel
2014-02-07 22:41:46	@d4n13L	the ctcpflood module protects you against ctcp flooding, not more, not less

2014-02-07 22:43:25	@d4n13L	when you want to ignore a user, that's a thing your irc client should handle
2014-02-07 22:44:25	n00b689	nono

2014-02-07 22:46:03	n00b689	so i placed the bot into a bnc
2014-02-07 22:46:06	haltdef_	would it not be a better idea to fix the bot

2014-02-07 22:46:27	n00b689	quakenet has floodprotection
2014-02-07 22:46:29	haltdef	it what a rhetorical question, it is a better idea to fix the bot
2014-02-07 22:47:28	@d4n13L	no irc network has a flood protection. if you send too much, it'll kill you with a message like excess flood. fix your bot to buffer many lines and not send them directly to the IRC server
2014-02-07 22:47:47	n00b689	then the bot gets to slow
2014-02-07 22:48:04	n00b689	quakenet has floodprotection lol

2014-02-12 00:35:30	marenma	i am using znc on shell...but i have host like @909435..website.nl

2014-02-12 00:37:46	marenma	is it possible to change that stupid vhost for IP adress only?
2014-02-12 00:38:51	@d4n13L	you have to ask your provider to remove the reverse-dns for that host. so probably, no
2014-02-12 00:39:40	marenma	ah ok thx d4n13L

2014-02-12 08:57:50	GuntherDW	Hi, a friend of mine seems to be having a couple issues with his ZNC server on a debian stable VPS
2014-02-12 08:58:10	GuntherDW	Now we've tracked the issue down to the SSL module derping around
2014-02-12 08:58:22	GuntherDW	like the issue here on github
2014-02-12 08:58:24	GuntherDW	https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/248
2014-02-12 08:58:24	ZNCLinker	https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/248 “SSL handshake failed because of a problem with the pem file without SSH.” (closed)
2014-02-12 08:58:38	GuntherDW	But that's been closed with just "bug fixed"
2014-02-12 08:59:03	GuntherDW	does that mean that he has to update ZNC to the "debian unstable/testing repo" version, or is there something else that he can try?
2014-02-12 08:59:49	GuntherDW	(The chance of someone sending a reply back on a year-old issue is kind of small so I thought I'd check IRC)
2014-02-12 09:12:48	GuntherDW	Well it doesn't seem like he's running stable to me, he noted "ZNC 1.0+deb5" was his running version, but according to packages.debian.org stable is still the pre-1.0 version
2014-02-12 09:13:09	GuntherDW	http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/znc -> "Package: znc (0.206-2)"
2014-02-12 09:18:38	KindOne	he pulled the znc package from some unstable/testing thing
2014-02-12 09:21:46	KindOne	just looked though my channel logs and according to him, "<Xoib> I fix the solution by doing an ssh localhost inside a screen/nohup thing, so my home is never unmount ? #shit solution"
2014-02-12 09:35:29	KindOne	GuntherDW, you can also talk with Xoib, its his/her issue
2014-02-12 09:41:18	GuntherDW	Yeah, looks like he's running ubuntu, not debian *facepalm on my side
2014-02-12 09:41:19	GuntherDW	*
2014-02-12 09:44:08	GuntherDW	Haha KindOne looks like he's going for that "fix" as well it's 02:43 AM over here and he's kinda tired and does not want to screw around that much more with his system atm :p
2014-02-12 09:47:10	GuntherDW	But thanks anyway

2014-02-16 00:13:55	NeedAChan	so a sudo apt-get install swig installs swig?
2014-02-16 00:14:12	NeedAChan	well, I have root axx on server
2014-02-16 00:14:47	@DGandalf	most probably you don't even need swig

2014-02-16 00:16:24	NeedAChan	ok. But is it ok if I post some issues as I encounter while installing/compiling here?

2014-02-16 01:03:06	bayev_co	apt-get install python-devel should work

2014-02-16 01:04:00	NeedAChan	would that suffice?
2014-02-16 01:05:49	bayev_co	I'm not sure.. python-devel should make the deal, but reinstalling python 3.3 from the source..
2014-02-16 01:06:55	NeedAChan	I will give it a try

2014-02-19 10:46:50	woky	[15:56:56] Hello. Can I deny loading certain modules for all/certain users? I'd like  to disable Shell for instance.
2014-02-19 10:46:50	@SilverLeo	[16:06:55] shell is only allowed for admins anyway
2014-02-19 10:46:50	@SilverLeo	[16:07:51] you can only deny loading all modules per user, or if you remove the module file then nobody can load it

2014-02-27 11:39:59	jorgenpt	Does anyone else have issues with irssi forgetting which window belongs where and leaving you with a bunch of empty windows (and opening all the channels in new windows) when ZNC disconnects from the IRC server?
2014-02-27 11:40:36	jorgenpt	I get something like
2014-02-27 11:40:37	jorgenpt	<*route_replies> This module hit a timeout which is possibly a bug.
2014-02-27 11:42:38	jorgenpt	Then a few minutes later irssi goes: -!- Irssi: No PONG reply from server <znc hostname> in 301 seconds, disconnecting
2014-02-27 11:42:46	jorgenpt	And when it reconnects everything is bonkers.
2014-02-27 11:44:32	jorgenpt	Well, 10-12 minutes later ZNC reconnects to the IRC server
2014-02-27 11:45:32	jorgenpt	Actually, let me rephrase.
2014-02-27 11:46:33	jorgenpt	This is the events as they transpired: <*route_replies> This module hit a timeout which is possibly a bug. -- then, a couple of minutes later, -!- Irssi: No PONG reply from server <znc hostname> in 301 seconds, disconnecting, and irssi reconnects to ZNC, then ten minutes later, another <*route_replies> This module hit a timeout which is possibly a bug., ZNC reconnects to the IRC server, and then all my channels have been messed up.
2014-02-27 11:53:55	jorgenpt	http://pastebin.com/njfudNDz -- to be exact.

2014-02-27 17:31:28	@psychon	however, that causes warnings from Modules.cpp which I don't like at all

2014-02-27 17:37:18	@psychon	the important part is the change to CChan
2014-02-27 17:37:44	@psychon	previously it would just skip the module calls for server mode changes (pOpNick == NULL), now it calls the hooks with that NULL pointer

2014-02-28 21:47:53	nghtshd	yeah
2014-02-28 21:48:02	nghtshd	the first timer runs
2014-02-28 21:48:13	nghtshd	the second timer will run after the first stops
2014-02-28 21:48:54	@usc	add label="foo" and label="bar"
2014-02-28 21:49:01	@usc	timers need unique labels
2014-02-28 21:49:16	@usc	also, I didn't know modpython / modperl have these timer wrappers...
2014-02-28 21:49:44	nghtshd	ok. thanks. the modpyton page doesn't mention this and the example doesn't use the label args
2014-02-28 21:50:38	@usc	feel free to add that info
2014-02-28 21:50:49	@usc	the C++ code just deletes the new timer if another one with the same label already exist

2014-02-28 21:51:46	nghtshd	yep, that fixed it. thanks

If I have to disconnect several users for some reason, I have to manually find them, their networks, disconnect and save or I can just guess their network's name
2014-03-04 01:20:07	amunak	and type it all in manually. That's not very convenient :/

2014-03-04 04:35:36	amunak	oh wow
2014-03-04 04:35:44	amunak	when that went in?
2014-03-04 04:35:49	amunak	I completly missed it.
2014-03-04 04:35:50	amunak	Thanks
2014-03-04 05:44:39	Jordy	How can you receive the channel list of a user? (Possible via *status or *admin, *controlpanel)?
2014-03-04 05:48:17	amunak	Jordy: ListChans              | [User <network>]
2014-03-04 05:48:34	amunak	or via web interface
2014-03-04 05:49:53	Jordy	That's just for the logged in user. :/
2014-03-04 05:51:15	Jordy	is it available in admin? I just tried :/
2014-03-04 05:51:45	amunak	Jordy, what do you mean? I can use something like /msg *status ListChans user efnet and it shows his channels even if he isn't connected to the znc. You have to be an admin, of course.
2014-03-04 05:52:09	Jordy	For a custom ZNC panel.
2014-03-04 05:52:19	Jordy	Just like the original ZNC panel does.
2014-03-04 05:53:46	Jordy	*status would require the panel to auth as the user which requires plaintext passwords

2014-03-07 03:09:22	jpnurmi	genin: in irc jargon, "perform" refers to irc commands that are sent to the server automatically after getting connected
2014-03-07 03:09:57	jpnurmi	you cannot send much after getting disconnected :)
2014-03-07 03:10:30	jpnurmi	you can implement a znc module to do something when you get disconnected, though
2014-03-07 03:16:37	KindOne	I think I've seen a module do that
2014-03-07 03:18:50	KindOne	http://wiki.znc.in/Antiperform
2014-03-07 03:19:14	jpnurmi	heh, there's a znc module for everything
2014-03-07 03:25:50	jpnurmi	there's a slight difference between "after disconnected" and "when disconnecting" though :)

2014-03-07 05:29:50	jpnurmi	DGandalf: binary compatibility
2014-03-07 05:30:07	@DGandalf	I thought, usually people refer to it as API/ABI
2014-03-07 05:30:21	@DGandalf	s/\//vs/

2014-03-07 05:32:29	jpnurmi	DGandalf: sure, abi works too. :) the idea would be, in bugfix releases, not to touch anything in the api so that the abi changes
2014-03-07 05:33:09	jpnurmi	so modules built against 1.3.0 would continue running fine with 1.3.1 and 1.3.2

2014-03-07 05:33:17	@DGandalf	jpnurmi: ok, let's get back to that chansaver fix, which involved adding/changing OnMode() ;)
2014-03-07 05:33:59	@DGandalf	I don't see any reason to rename headers/classes as ZBlah
2014-03-07 05:34:19	@DGandalf	headers: already have znc/ prefix

2014-03-07 05:35:09	jpnurmi	DGandalf: i think that OnMode() change is a good candidate what i was referring to "write ideas for intrusive changes down" ;)
2014-03-07 05:35:11	@DGandalf	ZNCString is leftover from the time where we didn't have znc/
2014-03-07 05:35:28	@DGandalf	(0.x)
2014-03-07 05:35:37	jpnurmi	sure, as long as it's consistent :)
2014-03-07 05:36:11	jpnurmi	znc::class works just as well. i was throwing in names inspired by qt (surprise, surprise)
2014-03-07 05:36:12	@DGandalf	classes: we're in C++ world, why some stupid prefix instead of namespaces?
2014-03-07 05:36:40	jpnurmi	namespaces have their own problems, but qt is somewhat special there with their moc, bells and whistles
2014-03-07 05:37:01	jpnurmi	imho ZString looks nice :)
2014-03-07 05:37:02	@DGandalf	What are problems of namespaces?
2014-03-07 05:38:28	jpnurmi	for znc probably none, as long as none of znc's headers contain any using statements
2014-03-07 05:39:55	@DGandalf	We already removed using std::foo; from headers...
2014-03-07 05:40:19	@DGandalf	(Which of course, broke some modules... Is it intrusive change?)
2014-03-07 05:40:38	jpnurmi	DGandalf: how critical was that OnMode() change/fix? could it have waited til the next major release if it was, let's say, released in a few months?
2014-03-07 05:41:00	jpnurmi	yes, breakages are evil for module developers :)
2014-03-07 05:42:36	@psychon	jpnurmi: since the bug existed in chansaver since forever, I dont think anyone would be sad if it would have taken another year to get fixed
2014-03-07 05:42:47	@DGandalf	psychon: since forever?
2014-03-07 05:42:56	@DGandalf	I believe, it was working at some point...
2014-03-07 05:43:12	@psychon	it cant? the API didnt allow to pass through server mode changes
2014-03-07 05:43:25	@psychon	or did znc core once call CChan::SetKey()?
2014-03-07 05:43:46	@DGandalf	Uhm, ok

2014-03-07 15:43:57	T_D_H	system user
2014-03-07 15:44:13	@DGandalf	So what did you put to /etc/oidentd.conf?
2014-03-07 15:44:51	T_D_H	I pasted exactly what it said, and changed ZNC" to the user that is running znc, which is tdh
2014-03-07 15:45:51	@DGandalf	oidentd has read access to ~tdh/.oidentd.conf?
2014-03-07 15:46:20	T_D_H	I chmod'd everything as it asked, Ill check permissions to be sure
2014-03-07 15:49:02	T_D_H	its 644
2014-03-07 15:49:45	T_D_H	so should be fine, also, that file is empty, it is supposed to be? or is it supposed to bea copy of /etc/oident.conf?
2014-03-07 15:50:03	@DGandalf	And your home dir? including path to it?
2014-03-07 15:50:12	@DGandalf	e.g. /home
2014-03-07 15:50:21	@DGandalf	if it's /home/tdh
2014-03-07 15:50:46	@DGandalf	empty is fine
2014-03-07 15:50:47	T_D_H	that wasnt readable
2014-03-07 15:50:56	T_D_H	tdh wasnt
2014-03-07 15:51:19	@DGandalf	Then you didn't follow it very verbatim :P
2014-03-07 15:51:24	T_D_H	I guess that would mess it up
2014-03-07 15:51:37	T_D_H	i did though!

2014-03-07 15:52:23	T_D_H	knew it was something stupid I'd missed
2014-03-07 15:52:43	@DGandalf	T_D_H: add some troubleshooting section to wiki
2014-03-07 15:52:56	@DGandalf	to that page, I mean
2014-03-07 15:53:14	@DGandalf	with common mistakes
2014-03-07 15:54:00	T_D_H	lol I'm great with those, but yeah might as well, lets hope wiki is easy to screw with, never done it before

2014-03-12 16:04:40	@DGandalf	Random guess: while you're trying to save config, are you inside tty1?
2014-03-12 16:04:50	@DGandalf	And how do you try to save config at all?
2014-03-12 16:05:26	Sprocks	for a whole i was saving config with /znc saveconfig or using the web admin
2014-03-12 16:05:34	Sprocks	both of which don't work right now
2014-03-12 16:05:40	Sprocks	while*
2014-03-12 16:06:05	@DGandalf	And now you're in tty1?
2014-03-12 16:06:13	 *	DGandalf got reminded about https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/248
2014-03-12 16:07:27	Sprocks	right now I'm not at the machine but i can be, whys the command to save from tty1 again?
2014-03-12 16:07:45	Sprocks	whats*
2014-03-12 16:08:14	@DGandalf	if that is the reason, open ssh (or tty1) to the machine, and while it's opened, save config from webadmin or via /znc as usual
2014-03-12 16:09:16	Sprocks	I'm logged into tty1 and pts/0 right now and saveconfig doesn't work
2014-03-12 16:09:29	@DGandalf	Well, random guess didn't work then :(
2014-03-12 16:13:10	Sprocks	*status responds "Error while trying to write config." webadmin says "Network added/modified, but config was not written" so thats why i was hoping it was just delete file and resave
2014-03-12 16:14:15	@SilverLeo	if you simply renamed the file, znc still has a handle to it. you should copy it and then delete the original and try saving again
2014-03-12 16:16:01	@SilverLeo	if you wanted to properly debug the error, you should attach strace to the znc process and then try saving, maybe it'll show some more detail
2014-03-12 16:17:06	Sprocks	tried doing cp znc.conf znc.conf.old and deleting znc.conf had the same issue, should i try copying it out of the folder all together?
2014-03-12 16:17:51	@DGandalf	what does strace say?

2014-03-12 16:24:48	Sprocks	well that spit a lot of info to the terminal repeatedly
2014-03-12 16:25:48	Sprocks	i had to sudo strace for it
2014-03-12 16:26:51	Sprocks	would you like a paste bin of it?

2014-03-12 16:31:07	@SilverLeo	only the part where you try to save the config
2014-03-12 16:31:20	@SilverLeo	and beaware that the trace may have private info in it
2014-03-12 16:31:56	Sprocks	the problem is it spit so much data to the terminal its hard to know when it actually tried to save
2014-03-12 16:31:56	@DGandalf	check the part when you're trying to save config
2014-03-12 16:31:56	 *	DGandalf has to go now
2014-03-12 16:32:49	@SilverLeo	Sprocks: put it all to a file and parse it afterwards, strace -p`pidof znc` -o strace.txt
2014-03-12 16:33:33	@SilverLeo	in the file you should find the part that begins with your saveconfig command etc.
2014-03-12 16:36:19	Sprocks	i don't see saveconfig in the file at all
2014-03-12 16:37:23	Sprocks	and theres only one mention of config
2014-03-12 16:39:35	Sprocks	one single line ending in "O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0600) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)"
2014-03-12 16:40:13	Sprocks	it looks like it was pointing at ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf~ though
2014-03-12 16:41:09	Sprocks	which is weird since that file is 0b and i have no idea why its there
2014-03-12 16:42:04	@SilverLeo	it's a temp file that's supposed to be written first to make sure we don't make a 0byte znc.conf
2014-03-12 16:42:14	@SilverLeo	you can delete the znc.conf~ and try again
2014-03-12 16:43:19	Sprocks	"*status> Wrote config to [/home/user/.znc/configs/znc.conf]"
2014-03-12 16:43:25	@SilverLeo	did you give us the error *status gave you? i didn't catch that
2014-03-12 16:43:50	Sprocks	yes it was "Error while trying to write config."
2014-03-12 16:44:09	Sprocks	and then webadmin said chagned but not written
2014-03-12 16:44:15	Sprocks	it looks like it is working now :)
2014-03-12 16:44:23	@SilverLeo	oh right, the more detailed error is only shown if you had run znc with --debug
2014-03-12 16:45:32	@SilverLeo	with --debug you would've seen the error was on the znc.conf~ file and not the actual conf file
2014-03-12 16:45:40	Sprocks	so it looks like it tried to save the config but lost power and the temp file was still there, at least to me it seems that way since the .conf~ files doesn't exist after i saved the config twice
2014-03-12 16:46:30	@SilverLeo	yea, once the save is succesful the temp file is moved ontop the actual conf
2014-03-12 16:46:39	Sprocks	thanks for the help SilverLeo & DGandalf, it was bothering me that i could update my bouncer setting for fear of losing then when rebooting the machine

2014-03-15 08:08:14	Cranium	It should be noted that I use CentOS
2014-03-15 08:22:10	JZTech101	what service?
2014-03-15 08:22:12	JZTech101	o,o
2014-03-15 08:22:36	JZTech101	Cranium: I'm going to say the ZNC service? or do you mean the port number?
2014-03-15 08:22:51	Cranium	I mean, I am trying to edit the SRV records, and it asks for the service name
2014-03-15 08:23:00	JZTech101	nc
2014-03-15 08:23:04	JZTech101	znc *
2014-03-15 08:23:09	Cranium	http://puu.sh/7vB0T.png
2014-03-15 08:23:15	Cranium	it doesn't work
2014-03-15 08:23:34	JZTech101	Why is there a _ before znc?
2014-03-15 08:23:35	Cranium	also, using service znc on my server doesn't recognize a service
2014-03-15 08:23:44	JZTech101	hrm...
2014-03-15 08:23:53	Cranium	because it automatically prepends a _ before the service and the protocol
2014-03-15 08:24:03	JZTech101	I suggest trying you luck on freenode. I was told fuck off last time I tried asking for help here
2014-03-15 08:24:07	JZTech101	your*

2014-03-15 08:27:16	Cranium	do you know what an srv record is?
2014-03-15 08:27:38	JZTech101	probably not
2014-03-15 08:27:40	JZTech101	lolololol
2014-03-15 08:27:43	Cranium	........
2014-03-15 08:28:19	JZTech101	all I know is it has something to do with domain names
2014-03-15 08:28:29	JZTech101	neverreally cared much for it though
2014-03-15 08:31:10	Cranium	you're not very helpful...
2014-03-15 08:34:58	Cranium	I guess I'll just have to wait a long time for any answer
2014-03-15 08:37:42	thommey	well, the official registration of services names is at IANA, and there's no assignment for znc (no surprise there, as znc is just one of many IRC bouncers available, but I could find none at all registered, also no real surprise)
2014-03-15 08:38:37	thommey	I'm not sure why you want that record. if you have a specific client doing srv record checks and attempting to connect to znc on that.. adapt to what it can use (which might be _irc, given that bouncers speak the irc protocol towards the client)
2014-03-15 08:38:57	thommey	http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml services list, FWIW
2014-03-15 08:39:37	Cranium	All I want is to be able to refer to say, irc.thatcraniumguy.net, and have it point to my bouncer web frontend
2014-03-15 08:40:38	thommey	a web browser, if you give it that address, will try to contact http://irc.thatcradniumguy.net which will check the A record and connect to TCP port 80; you could redirect that port to your webinterface
2014-03-15 08:42:17	thommey	srv records are rather rare and specific to certain services types
2014-03-15 08:43:03	Cranium	well, I'm just not sure how to do what you're saying there
2014-03-15 08:44:13	Cranium	tcp port 80 is regular http, isn't it?
2014-03-15 08:44:18	thommey	yeah
2014-03-15 08:44:30	Cranium	so if I redirect port 80, then won't my site fudge up?
2014-03-15 08:44:51	thommey	if you have one running at irc.thatcradniumguy.net, sure
2014-03-15 08:44:55	thommey	I assumed you weren't
2014-03-15 08:45:00	Cranium	no, I don't
2014-03-15 08:45:12	Cranium	but I have one at thatcraniumguy.net
2014-03-15 08:45:26	thommey	your webserver can be configured to distinguish them
2014-03-15 08:45:42	Cranium	not sure I'm following
2014-03-15 08:46:03	thommey	you just want to reach the znc webinterface? all you need is http://irc.thatcradniumguy.net:<port>
2014-03-15 08:46:24	Cranium	wel, yes, but I'd rather not have to enter in the port number
2014-03-15 08:46:31	Cranium	as I plan on linking to it
2014-03-15 08:46:56	thommey	the webserver you're using can redirect you then
2014-03-15 08:47:56	thommey	irc.thatcradniumguy.net doesn't resolve for me at all, no A record
2014-03-15 08:48:14	Cranium	cause you're spelling it wrong :P
2014-03-15 08:48:16	thommey	oh
2014-03-15 08:48:18	thommey	sorry :)
2014-03-15 08:48:44	thommey	at the moment your webserver is serving the same website for http://irc.thatcraniumguy.net/ and http://thatcraniumguy.net/ and you can change that
2014-03-15 08:50:18	Cranium	okay, so the only place I have http://irc.thatcraniumguy.net/ anywhere tight now is in the A records
2014-03-15 08:50:21	Cranium	right*
2014-03-15 08:51:01	Cranium	you're saying that not my domain registrar, but my server would be the one to do this? (it's all managed by me, just renting a server)
2014-03-15 08:51:02	thommey	and that's enough, you need to add a virtual host to apache to recognize it's different from the default host, then add the redirect somehow (mod_rewrite is an option)
2014-03-15 08:51:35	thommey	yes, it's all you if you administrate apache there
2014-03-15 08:51:36	Cranium	oh, well then flip that. seems like it's too much trouble just to drop the port number

2014-03-20 16:45:46	nightfrog	Can the channel be appended to the autoop module notice? I have a script to respond to the notice but if I need to respond to the same autoop in different channels with different passwords, I have no way of checking which channel a notice is for
2014-03-20 16:48:24	@SilverLeo	which notice?
2014-03-20 16:49:15	nightfrog	There is no way to know which channel the autoop was triggered in
2014-03-20 16:50:08	nightfrog	if I identify to the same autoop in different channels, I HAVE to use the same password
2014-03-20 16:50:39	nightfrog	If I want separate passwords per channel I can't
2014-03-20 16:54:12	nightfrog	I can't write my script to check channels. If Aop is running the autoop module in #chan1 and #chan2 and I can auth to both Aop in both and gain ops, I have to setup autoop with the same password for both #chan1 and #chan2
2014-03-20 16:58:23	nightfrog	ctcp instead of notices would be a little more secure since its client to client

2014-03-20 17:07:44	@SilverLeo	lol
2014-03-20 17:08:38	@psychon	also, so what's the problem with needing to have the same password in both channels?
2014-03-20 17:09:01	@psychon	it doesnt make sense for autoop to list the channels that it is authing you for because it's all channels that you both have in common
2014-03-20 17:09:18	@psychon	there are no per-channel-authentications, it just auths you once and then ops you in all common channels
2014-03-20 17:12:45	nightfrog	Why would you want to be opped in all channels. Only need one

2014-03-20 17:20:55	nightfrog	So if I am in #chan1 already and been deopped, as soon as I auth in #chan2 I will be oppped in #chan1 even though I dont want it?

2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:19:46] Did find out about my problem, KindOne 
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:20:00] Just trying to get the Ubuntu end of it working.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:20:23] Mostly with getting ZNC to run at boot as a certain user for the propper configs.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:20:34] But I have no idea how to do that.

2014-04-02 06:37:27	ZNCLinker	[13:20:46] http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ
2014-04-02 06:37:27	KindOne	[13:20:58] look for "cron"
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:22:27] So
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:22:29] */10 * * * *   /home/you/znc/bin/znc >/dev/null 2>&1
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:22:56] Will run ZNC under the user needed or do I need to install the Vixie CRON?
2014-04-02 06:37:27	KindOne	[13:23:04] mmm no clue what "propper" is
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:23:57] The files needed to be used
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:24:19] The configs are placed in a user dedicated for ZNC
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:24:39] "/home/znc"
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:25:08] Or, "/home/znc/.znc/[Config]"
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:26:12] I'm afraid of adding to the init.d to tell it to run where znc is located and use a root account config, which wouldn't exist here.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:34:20] Crontab will start on boot, right?
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:34:24] I mean
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:34:27] Er..
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:35:00] Crontab replies back that it's editing my crontab.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	trist4n	[13:35:04] "init script".
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:35:29] I need to run ZNC under a account of choice on boot.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:36:04] Not attempt at using a root account.
2014-04-02 06:37:27	trist4n	[13:38:11] drop it in their crontab?
2014-04-02 06:37:27	WhiteFusi	[13:38:29] And that'll run ZNC at boot, right?
