2013-09-08 06:39:29	Leftmost	Can any Fedora Fonts SIG members suggest what should go in the docs for an OFL font?
2013-09-08 06:59:24	Leftmost	It contains a doc/ directory, but the files within need XeTeX to build. Should I just require it for build deps anyhow?

2013-09-08 08:12:33	Leftmost	Has anyone approached people who make available their fonts for free but disallow modification about putting the font under an open license? There are some Syriac fonts I'd like to see open. They allow distribution, but not modification.
2013-09-08 08:13:56	Ankh	I did approach one person, who refused.
2013-09-08 08:15:03	Leftmost	I'm wondering what tack I should take. I think the ideals of the institution might mean they'd go for it, but I'm not sure how best to make the argument.
2013-09-08 08:20:31	Ankh	write to the institution rather than the individual, perhaps
2013-09-08 08:21:00	Ankh	and mention that the institution will receive credit in GNU/Linux distributions downloaded by millions of people
2013-09-08 08:33:40	Leftmost	The individual mentioned in the license documents is the director, so it's likely he's the best resource.
2013-09-08 09:04:36	Ankh	yes
2013-09-08 09:13:09	Leftmost	I sent him an email. We'll see what happens now.
2013-09-08 09:26:33	Ankh	g'luck
2013-09-08 09:29:29	Leftmost	Thank you.

2013-09-12 22:01:58	Leftmost	paragan, yeah. I'm half-tempted to email the guy just to ask if he'd accept an autotools build system for Linux. :-P
2013-09-12 22:08:24	Ankh	Leftmost, there's also fontforge, and inkscape has some font creation stuff too
2013-09-12 22:08:35	Ankh	(for SVG fonts in that case)
2013-09-12 22:10:21	Leftmost	Yeah. I've used fontforge a little in the past, but not for anything serious. Contemplating trying to create an open font by tracing some works that have lapsed to the public domain, though, and not really looking forward to fontforge.
2013-09-12 22:12:20	paragan	Leftmost, ok
2013-09-12 22:12:23	Leftmost	Haven't created a font from scratch before and fontforge makes it a bit daunting.
2013-09-12 22:15:45	Ankh	fontforge isn't too hard actually
2013-09-12 22:16:38	Ankh	it's a bit idiosyncratic and uses its own GUI toolkit. There are tools for tracing bitmaps to fonts too. Watch out that tracing scans of fonts doesn't generally make good digital fonts :)
2013-09-12 22:17:23	Leftmost	What generally goes wrong?
2013-09-12 22:35:40	Leftmost	Is it an issue with autotracing? My intention was to do it by hand.
2013-09-12 22:36:14	Ankh	by hand is sometimes easier
2013-09-12 22:36:41	Ankh	you have to make sure paths go clockwise, cut-outs go anticlockwise, and no overlaps
2013-09-12 22:37:45	Leftmost	I suspect I'll be asking a lot of questions in here.
2013-09-12 22:38:15	Ankh	fontforge has menu items to check you're doing that part right
2013-09-12 22:38:31	Ankh	and can remove common errors like two points that are almost vertical but not quite

2013-09-13 01:14:30	Ankh	there are tutorials on bizier curves out there
2013-09-13 01:14:30	Ankh	and on tracing for fonts
2013-09-13 01:14:33	Leftmost	Actually doing it isn't the problem so much as doing it well.
2013-09-13 01:14:46	Ankh	drink lots of water and don't wear shoes.
2013-09-13 01:15:44	Ankh	short of generic advice like that, I'd have to see what you'd done probably, and others can give better advice then me, e.g. maybe on typofile
2013-09-13 01:15:47	Leftmost	Practice, practice, practice?
2013-09-13 01:21:50	Leftmost	Would you mind giving critique on a first character? It's not important, so feel free to say no, would just like to improve.
2013-09-13 01:24:32	Leftmost	And thanks for your patience. I ask a lot of questions until I feel comfortable doing something.
2013-09-13 01:26:00	Ankh	I can look
2013-09-13 01:26:12	Ankh	and yes, practice, too :D
2013-09-13 01:26:37	Leftmost	SFD, TTF or just an image?
2013-09-13 01:26:40	Ankh	at some of the font events such as typecon there are experienced type designers who spend time looking at work
2013-09-13 01:26:47	Ankh	image would be easiest probably

2013-09-13 01:28:53	Ankh	the counter (the inner white part) probably needs to go further towards the apex, especially if this is to be used for printing, as corners tend to "fill in" a little in printing - allowing for that is done using "ink traps"
2013-09-13 01:29:20	Ankh	for old english?
2013-09-13 01:29:32	Leftmost	Irish.
2013-09-13 01:29:34	Ankh	ah ok
2013-09-13 01:29:50	Ankh	I have a book about irish type design at home but I won't be back home for a couple of weeks
2013-09-13 01:29:56	Leftmost	That style of type was used for text in Irish up until the early 20th century.
2013-09-13 01:30:02	Ankh	yeah
2013-09-13 01:30:17	Ankh	looking a the 2nd "a" I can see it's a combination of ink filling in and paper texture
2013-09-13 01:31:00	Ankh	one technique is to take several letters that are supposed to be the same and superimpose them (e.g. in gimp, use file->open as layers) to get a feel for distortions that came from printing
2013-09-13 01:31:39	Leftmost	Okay.

2013-09-13 01:55:03	Ankh	looks like you might have only a few extras (e.g. the two at bottm middle could probably be replaced by just one)
2013-09-13 01:55:38	Ankh	there's a paths/simplify command in fontforge iirc, or fix (I muddle up inkscape and fontforge, sorry)
2013-09-13 01:55:51	 *	Ankh off for dinner though
2013-09-13 01:56:12	Ankh	do try comparing multiple glyphs, I think you'll get a better result
2013-09-13 01:56:29	Ankh	and also open up some professionally-made fonts, e.g. georgia and verdana, and look at the control points
2013-09-13 01:57:39	Leftmost	Alright. Thank you for the advice.

2013-09-13 03:33:12	Leftmost	Lines should be a little cleaner in general.
2013-09-13 03:38:54	Ankh	it's a bit small to see really, but you've lost the calligraphic pen aspect
2013-09-13 03:39:48	Ankh	it would help a lot to practice drawing the alphabet with a broad-edged pen (even a felt pen) or, much larger, with two pencils tied together with rubber bands to draw parallel lines
2013-09-13 03:40:39	Leftmost	Well, I'm hoping more for a printed look, to match the source.

2013-09-13 03:43:07	Ankh	the source was based on scribal forms though
2013-09-13 03:43:55	Ankh	the bottom-right corner of the letter in your sample had a blunt, not pointed, finial; I did say that the whole letter lacked a bit of crispness in the first instance. Well, it's a style, maybe best to go on to some other glyphs first ;)
2013-09-13 03:44:24	Leftmost	Fair enough. I would prefer a more blunted point. Just getting the hang of it still.
2013-09-13 03:46:58	Leftmost	And the source is based on scribal forms, but they've by that time been fairly well-codified and the structure of the character seems less calligraphic to me.
2013-09-13 03:47:56	Leftmost	I think I'm ready to set this character aside until I have more practice, though.
2013-09-13 03:48:22	Leftmost	I have to run, but thanks again for your advice and patience.

2013-09-15 01:00:53	pabs3	pingu2: can it output UFO format?
2013-09-15 01:04:27	Leftmost	pabs3, some Syriac fonts to OFL.
2013-09-15 01:06:32	pabs3	Leftmost: and before they were?
2013-09-15 01:07:11	Leftmost	A custom license. It allows distribution under some conditions, but no modification.
2013-09-15 01:08:10	pabs3	nice improvement, great
2013-09-15 01:09:09	pingu2	pabs3: no.  do you think that would be useful?  currenly woff, ttf and plan to add eot
2013-09-15 01:09:11	Leftmost	I'm pretty happy. I approached them mentioning I'd like to package the fonts for Fedora, and they want to hear a little bit more about that, but it's a good first response, I think.
2013-09-15 01:10:28	pabs3	pingu2: definitely since that is more amenable to being stored in a VCS like git and is the standard source format for desktop font editors
2013-09-15 01:10:57	pabs3	Leftmost: whats the URL? I should add that to https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts/Missing
2013-09-15 01:11:45	Leftmost	http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html
2013-09-15 01:11:55	pingu2	pabs3: i'll look into it, thanks.  the application is a replacement for desktop editors, potentially
2013-09-15 01:12:03	Leftmost	pabs3, want me to ping you if they agree to the change?
2013-09-15 01:12:57	pabs3	sure, I'll be offline soon but mail pabs@debian.org if they do
2013-09-15 01:13:09	pabs3	or pkg-fonts-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
2013-09-15 01:13:56	Leftmost	Cool, can do.
2013-09-15 01:14:37	pabs3	thanks
2013-09-15 01:15:02	pingu2	that inverted metrics stuff is a small part of it.  the main function is to combine or pass source fonts through the tool, reworking the hinting, spacing and scale.  i'll link in here once it's live if that's cool
2013-09-15 01:15:50	 *	pabs3 needs to look at adding UFO output to fonttools
2013-09-15 01:16:51	pingu2	my big pie in the sky project for the future is browser-based vector edits.  i have svg uploads sorted

2013-09-15 01:21:11	pingu2	ah

2013-09-15 01:21:52	pabs3	so I've a bit of work to do for merging that once I have some time
2013-09-15 01:21:57	pingu2	im a bit of a newbie when it comes to fonts and typography.  im more of a general web coder.  ive had to try and make myself an expert on fonts for this one project
2013-09-15 01:22:12	pingu2	ive found it quite exhausting
2013-09-15 01:23:17	diogenese	It's always good to see more tools.
2013-09-15 01:25:15	pingu2	agree, there arent enough.  i guess fonts are still quite an obscure area.  that's changing with webfonts becoming popular.  pabs3: tools like yours limping along have helped a lot.  very underrated.  gj keeping it going
2013-09-15 01:27:25	diogenese	I have one I've been working on for a long time. Getting grid fitting right is hard, or was. ttfautohint fixed that.
2013-09-15 01:29:35	pingu2	*obscure/specialist.  ttfautohint is good stuff, yep
2013-09-15 01:31:33	diogenese	Great tool. I expect more will start showing up. Looked at the birdfont editor a few days ago. Needs a lot of work, but has promise.

2013-09-24 21:08:12	pingu2	yes
2013-09-24 21:09:14	paragan	where can I see that? is it live url?
2013-09-24 21:10:33	pingu2	i didn't want it to come across like spam.  would genuinely value some feedback http://fontcombiner.com/
2013-09-24 21:11:02	pingu2	very early stages - there may still be a bug or two
2013-09-24 21:19:48	paragan	ok
2013-09-24 21:21:06	paragan	I will check it later on and will let you know feedback.
2013-09-24 21:21:50	pingu2	thanks.  k. no rush

2013-09-24 21:22:36	pingu2	i haven't tested too much in linux, to be honest
2013-09-24 21:23:26	pingu2	i've been facing a bit of a dilemma - metrics and standards
2013-09-24 21:28:29	pingu2	linux dev communities might be a good place to get things scrutinised a bit more rigorously. im hoping to have nailed it http://fontcombiner.com/docs/metrics, but it's such a can of worms

2013-09-24 23:18:38	ecker	How would I go about generating a kerning table for a font which doesn't have one?
2013-09-24 23:18:47	ecker	Hi by the way

2013-09-24 23:22:36	Ankh	ecker, hi
2013-09-24 23:22:36	Ankh	there are two questions there really
2013-09-24 23:22:37	Ankh	one is how to achieve even letter-fit with pair kerning
2013-09-24 23:22:37	Ankh	and the other is how to get that information into a font
2013-09-24 23:22:37	ecker	Okey, I'm not too familiar with the internal structure of how fonts work yet.
2013-09-24 23:23:00	Ankh	the 2nd of those depends on the font format, or you can use a font editor (e.g. fontforge)
2013-09-24 23:24:22	ecker	My preference would be to have the kerning table exported as text and not put into the font, a table or something as I want to use it in a program.
2013-09-24 23:25:39	Ankh	if it's a type 1 PostScript font it does work that way
2013-09-24 23:26:13	ecker	One I was hoping to use is an Open type font
2013-09-24 23:27:47	ecker	I'm converting the font to bitmap, for processing purposes in a game. But obviously the kerning information is out the window.
2013-09-24 23:31:36	-->	JanC (~janc@lugwv/member/JanC) has joined ##fonts
2013-09-24 23:31:56	ecker	Looking at this now, I might have gone about this a bit backwards. There are plenty of tools which converts to bitmap that support kerning export... I've just done it the hard way manually. Thanks for the information Ankh.
2013-09-24 23:33:38	Ankh	yw, sorry I'm slow, in a meeting
2013-09-24 23:39:42	ecker	No problem, think I'm on the right track now :)
2013-09-24 23:46:01	Ankh	converting to bitmaps
2013-09-24 23:46:19	Ankh	usually it's best to render sequences of characters to bitmaps
2013-09-24 23:46:31	Ankh	e.g. because f followed by i should be rendered as an fi ligature
2013-09-24 23:50:17	ecker	That will be too big image files. I will hopefully have a supporting text file telling the game how to kern the bitmap text.
2013-09-24 23:52:57	Ankh	ah, ok, a game for a limited platform?
2013-09-25 00:02:53	 *	Ankh off for a bit

2013-09-25 05:01:18	ecker	The text is rendered by the OS, with bitmap text it's rendered by the graphics engine instead. Lot more powerful.

2013-10-03 21:28:59	pingu2	pabs3: any thoughts on kerning applied to web fonts?
2013-10-03 21:29:42	pabs3	my thoughts on web fonts are NSFI
2013-10-03 21:30:38	pingu2	i'm googling what that stands for. not safe for...
2013-10-03 21:31:34	pabs3	IRC :)
2013-10-03 21:31:53	pingu2	oh.  you don't like web fonts?  why not?
2013-10-03 21:33:55	diogenese	They're fun with the newer standards. Multiple shadows are great.
2013-10-03 21:35:16	pingu2	i think some of the free fonts around are really good
2013-10-03 21:36:52	diogenese	The more, the better. I've been collecting them for decades.
2013-10-03 21:37:49	pabs3	pingu2: browser attack surface bloat, how text should look on their system should be up to the user
2013-10-03 21:38:56	pingu2	mm.  that's an interesting argument.  i thought you were going to say that you'd designed a font and that web fonts were polluting its style
2013-10-03 21:48:56	pingu2	pabs3: perhaps there's an argument that a user would perfer to see a site the way the designer intended.  there is a bit of overlap between typography and the art or aesthetics of a good looking site.  web fonts give viewers that option
2013-10-03 21:50:09	pabs3	personally I would prefer all websites to look like the rest of my desktop. but ignore me, I'm turning into a grumpy old person and pine for the web before ecommerce, before javascript, before css etc
2013-10-03 21:50:48	pabs3	for me, content is more important than presentation
2013-10-03 21:56:22	diogenese	I've used embedded fonts mostly for fancy headers. Just started hearing the term 'web fonts' the last few years. I assume they're the same thing.

2013-10-03 22:38:34	pingu2	diogenese: are you on a modern browser?
2013-10-03 22:38:50	diogenese	I hope so.
2013-10-03 22:39:10	pingu2	could you take a look at this for me? http://fontcombiner.com/docs/webfontkerning
2013-10-03 22:42:23	pingu2	i seem to have a bug in this application.  for some reason the ampersand doesn't display unless it's standing alone in its own span (temporary test page: http://fontcombiner.com/docs/temp )
2013-10-03 22:42:24	diogenese	I'm still working on my font's kerning. It's hard to get right. Like getting a rock garden just so.
2013-10-03 22:42:42	pingu2	^ have you ever come across anything like that?
2013-10-03 22:43:48	pingu2	this is auto kerning.  im just a coder, no typographer, really : )
2013-10-03 22:46:29	diogenese	Could be that & is used for special characters. On the page should be &amp;
2013-10-03 22:47:06	pingu2	tried that
2013-10-03 22:48:55	pingu2	this stuff is really difficult.  no one in my usual circles really understands fonts, and probably for the same reasons (fonts/typograhy have their own complete field), it's hard to find font people who know about web code.  seems like there are lots of specialists and not much synergy
2013-10-03 23:00:05	pingu2	interesting.  http://jsfiddle.net/pZs6u/  it might be a bug i chrome
2013-10-03 23:00:08	pingu2	*in
2013-10-03 23:00:12	ankh	pingu2, are you encoding the ampersand properly?
2013-10-03 23:00:26	ankh	&#38; or &amp;
2013-10-03 23:00:32	pingu2	i tried both
2013-10-03 23:01:21	ankh	in firefox the first WAR & WAV line is unkerned
2013-10-03 23:01:32	pingu2	the first two should be
2013-10-03 23:01:40	ankh	2nd two lines are identical
2013-10-03 23:01:46	pingu2	oh
2013-10-03 23:01:56	pingu2	in firefox you said, yes, sorry
2013-10-03 23:02:06	pingu2	yep, FF applies kerning by default
2013-10-03 23:03:56	ankh	chrome, first two lines are the same
2013-10-03 23:04:13	ankh	third has the & too close to the R of WAR
2013-10-03 23:04:21	ankh	and is kerned
2013-10-03 23:05:07	pingu2	ankh: is the ampersand the same font in your chrome?
2013-10-03 23:05:13	pingu2	(on the third line)
2013-10-03 23:05:21	ankh	in all three lines? yes
2013-10-03 23:05:25	pingu2	oh
2013-10-03 23:05:31	pingu2	which chrome version/OS?
2013-10-03 23:05:55	ankh	Version 29.0.1547.72 Mageia.Org 4 (220395)
2013-10-03 23:06:01	ankh	I haven't updated recently
2013-10-03 23:06:15	ankh	(Linux)
2013-10-03 23:06:24	pingu2	im in Version 29.0.1547.76 m on windows
2013-10-03 23:07:50	diogenese	Me either, just started a cauldron update. 938 packages, lol.

2013-10-03 23:10:02	pingu2	im guessing, but it may be that chrome in windows treats characters it doesnt expect to appear as part of words differently in some way.  http://jsfiddle.net/pZs6u/1/
2013-10-03 23:10:23	pingu2	ankh: matter of interest, is the & kerned any differently in that second fiddle?
2013-10-03 23:10:53	ankh	yes
2013-10-03 23:10:57	ankh	wait
2013-10-03 23:11:41	ankh	2nd filldle much better in chromium
2013-10-03 23:11:53	ankh	if instead of span you put an extra word space it comes out right too
2013-10-03 23:12:03	ankh	might be a bug in the font
2013-10-03 23:12:09	pingu2	it could be
2013-10-03 23:12:32	pingu2	i'm hoping it's the browser
2013-10-03 23:15:21	ankh	Adobe Garamond Pro doesn't have the problem

2013-10-04 01:21:54	pingu2	are you talking about web font versions?
2013-10-04 01:33:04	ankh	no, I used the desktop versions
2013-10-04 01:33:35	ankh	hmm, no kerning in firefox
2013-10-04 01:33:52	ankh	3rd line has kerning in chromium
2013-10-04 01:34:08	ankh	this font stuff has been changing recently though
2013-10-04 01:34:21	ankh	I think a new draft of the css fonts spec will be out soon
2013-10-04 01:34:24	 *	ankh goes for coffee
2013-10-04 01:56:27	pingu2	i needed one too
2013-10-04 01:57:57	pingu2	yep, it's all brand new.  i read something about a font-kerning css property http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-kerning-prop.  i've not tested that
2013-10-04 02:00:49	pingu2	it was mainly just an experimental feature added to this application ive been working on
2013-10-04 02:03:23	pingu2	http://fontcombiner.com/ .  it was possibly too advanced anyway.  it's supposed to fill a niche as fun tool for drop-in fonts.  might be better to keep it simple.  (id really value feedback on that btw - anyone who might be set up to test)
2013-10-04 02:14:07	ankh	getting the metrics right for drop-in fonts is hard
2013-10-04 02:14:35	ankh	I can see demand especially for clip-art and symbol fonts though
2013-10-04 02:14:43	ankh	or for subsetting a single font
2013-10-04 02:17:20	pingu2	working through the metrics was exhausting

2013-10-04 11:18:30	pingu2	i fixed my ampersand problem
2013-10-04 11:19:30	diogenese	What was it?
2013-10-04 11:22:23	pingu2	im still not completely sure, but it turns out that if you create a subset that doesn't include a lowercase 'b', ampersands are ignored in webkit.  i suspect it's something to do with the language tags used in the gpos table
2013-10-04 11:23:15	pingu2	partly guessing.  the docs and specs on this stuff seem to be endless
2013-10-04 11:27:36	pingu2	a stab in the dark really.  possibly something to do with b as the second of a pair in latin script?
2013-10-04 11:28:32	diogenese	So adding the b to the kerning table fixed it?
2013-10-04 11:29:36	pingu2	seems to. there's some kerned text on the home page.  i don't want to keep pasting the url in case it looks like spam to freenode
2013-10-04 11:30:19	diogenese	People do get crazy of little things. ;)
2013-10-04 11:30:27	diogenese	s/of/over/
2013-10-04 11:31:57	pingu2	safari was removing the & completely.  no way that isn't a bug.  it should at least fall back to another font
2013-10-04 11:32:21	diogenese	I noticed a few days ago that no all of my fonts work as web fonts. Luckily I have a lot to choose from.
2013-10-04 11:32:49	pingu2	do you code a lot of websites?
2013-10-04 11:33:08	diogenese	Not if I can help it.
2013-10-04 11:34:18	diogenese	I've set up hundreds of sites over the years. That's actually fun. Dealing with customers is not.
2013-10-04 11:35:43	pingu2	agree, yep.  'up a bit, down a bit.  more red please.  no, i dont like it, can you change it back?' 4 hours gone
2013-10-04 11:36:23	pingu2	it would suit me to stick to serverside work if i could find enough
2013-10-04 11:36:26	diogenese	One group was trying to get me to correct pdf's the provided to me.
2013-10-04 11:36:39	diogenese	*they
2013-10-04 11:41:00	diogenese	You've got me looking at my font again. Kerning needs much work, but I have a few months before version freeze. Been lazy, my bad.
2013-10-04 11:41:56	pingu2	do you have it online?
2013-10-04 11:42:41	diogenese	You can download it from mageia cauldron, iirc.
2013-10-04 11:43:44	diogenese	This is from my site: http://bit.ly/12b3bcI
2013-10-04 11:46:03	pingu2	nice.  actually using it on the site?
2013-10-04 11:46:21	diogenese	I use it everywhere. Best way to debug.
2013-10-04 11:47:10	diogenese	It's my system font too. Different sizes kern differently. I need lot's of input to sort this.
2013-10-04 11:48:01	pingu2	kerning would make a difference.  e.g. Projects in the nav on the left
2013-10-04 11:48:48	diogenese	It came up on your links as the fallback and noticed that bold caps are kerned wrong....
2013-10-04 11:48:48	pingu2	i'm not sure kerning in browsers can be trusted yet
2013-10-04 11:50:07	diogenese	Before I found ttfautohint, was going crazy trying to get it working at small sizes. That's when I did the most damage to the kerning table. Still cleaning that up.
2013-10-04 11:50:48	pabs3	browsers just use the same font stuff as the rest of the desktop don't they? why would kerning be different
2013-10-04 11:51:13	pingu2	pabs3: no, every one is different
2013-10-04 11:52:01	diogenese	The different sizes have different grid fitting. 1 pixel this way or that makes a difference.
2013-10-04 11:52:03	pabs3	so they reimplement kerning using different code rather than just using the OS font code? weird
2013-10-04 11:55:10	pingu2	oh, specifically kerning rather than kerning, metrics, hinting?  from what i've seen, any browsers that support kerning at all seem to use gpos tables.  no clue how they go about it

2013-10-04 12:01:53	pingu2	firefox, chrome and IE all seem to render things differently, though.  slight differences in spacing, and the AA seems to vary a lot
2013-10-04 12:04:18	pabs3	oh this is on Windows?
2013-10-04 12:05:25	diogenese	No IE in linux. Not sure about mac, heard there was, never seen it.
2013-10-04 12:07:01	ankh	years ago there was
2013-10-04 12:07:05	ankh	3.5 iirc was the last
2013-10-04 12:07:16	ankh	and I thinkChris Wilson may have been product manager for it
2013-10-04 12:07:17	diogenese	Ah
2013-10-04 12:07:55	ankh	kerning in browsers - the CSS for this, and the support, is changing
2013-10-04 12:08:14	diogenese	I can believe that.
2013-10-04 12:08:15	ankh	iirc at the last CSS F2F (in Paris in Setember) we voted to publish a new draft
2013-10-04 12:15:03	diogenese	I like what I've seen in the new standards. More control over font appearance would be even better :)
2013-10-04 12:15:42	ankh	yeah
2013-10-04 12:16:07	ankh	but they are really working drafts right now
2013-10-04 12:16:09	ankh	not standards
2013-10-04 12:16:11	ankh	and liable to change
2013-10-04 12:16:32	diogenese	Of course.
2013-10-04 12:24:27	pingu2	webkit seems to need a text-rendering property to enable kerning.  i think i read on MDN that this is supposed to relate to SVG and that FF dropped it completely
2013-10-04 12:29:18	pingu2	MS have -ms-font-feature-settings.  i guess it's all still quite new territory.  i have no vote, but if i did, i'd say this looks perfect http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/#propdef-font-kerning.  auto|normal|none
2013-10-04 12:32:39	ankh	you don't have a formal vote but you can send comments to the working group

2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[18:59:27] hi.  hopefully this isn't seen as spam.  i'd value feedback on this from anyone really into fonts http://fontcombiner.com/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[19:01:13] i've just prepared a demo page showing screenshots of a few common fonts across the different platforms.  might be of interest http://fontcombiner.com/docs/demo
2013-10-06 09:57:39	rascal999	[15:11:17] http://imgur.com/DRbEVrx can anyone name the font?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[15:39:38] looks like something drawn with an image editor, not a font
2013-10-06 09:57:39	rascal999	[15:44:58] pabs3: it's a substitution font which i've recreated because i can't remember what it's called. It's impossible to read unless you've learnt it

2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:28:59] pabs3: any thoughts on kerning applied to web fonts?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[21:29:42] my thoughts on web fonts are NSFI
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:30:38] i'm googling what that stands for. not safe for...
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[21:31:34] IRC :)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:31:53] oh.  you don't like web fonts?  why not?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[21:33:55] They're fun with the newer standards. Multiple shadows are great.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:35:16] i think some of the free fonts around are really good
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[21:36:52] The more, the better. I've been collecting them for decades.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[21:37:49] pingu2: browser attack surface bloat, how text should look on their system should be up to the user
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:38:56] mm.  that's an interesting argument.  i thought you were going to say that you'd designed a font and that web fonts were polluting its style
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[21:48:56] pabs3: perhaps there's an argument that a user would perfer to see a site the way the designer intended.  there is a bit of overlap between typography and the art or aesthetics of a good looking site.  web fonts give viewers that option
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[21:50:09] personally I would prefer all websites to look like the rest of my desktop. but ignore me, I'm turning into a grumpy old person and pine for the web before ecommerce, before javascript, before css etc
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[21:50:48] for me, content is more important than presentation
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[21:56:22] I've used embedded fonts mostly for fancy headers. Just started hearing the term 'web fonts' the last few years. I assume they're the same thing.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:38:34] diogenese: are you on a modern browser?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:38:50] I hope so.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:39:10] could you take a look at this for me? http://fontcombiner.com/docs/webfontkerning
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:42:23] i seem to have a bug in this application.  for some reason the ampersand doesn't display unless it's standing alone in its own span (temporary test page: http://fontcombiner.com/docs/temp )
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:42:24] I'm still working on my font's kerning. It's hard to get right. Like getting a rock garden just so.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:42:42] ^ have you ever come across anything like that?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:43:48] this is auto kerning.  im just a coder, no typographer, really : )
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:46:29] Could be that & is used for special characters. On the page should be &amp;
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:47:06] tried that
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:48:55] this stuff is really difficult.  no one in my usual circles really understands fonts, and probably for the same reasons (fonts/typograhy have their own complete field), it's hard to find font people who know about web code.  seems like there are lots of specialists and not much synergy
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:00:05] interesting.  http://jsfiddle.net/pZs6u/  it might be a bug i chrome
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:00:08] *in
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:00:12] pingu2, are you encoding the ampersand properly?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:00:26] &#38; or &amp;
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:00:32] i tried both
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:01:21] in firefox the first WAR & WAV line is unkerned
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:01:32] the first two should be
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:01:40] 2nd two lines are identical
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:01:46] oh
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:01:56] in firefox you said, yes, sorry
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:02:06] yep, FF applies kerning by default
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:03:56] chrome, first two lines are the same
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:04:13] third has the & too close to the R of WAR
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:04:21] and is kerned
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:05:07] ankh: is the ampersand the same font in your chrome?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:05:13] (on the third line)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:05:21] in all three lines? yes
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:05:25] oh
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:05:31] which chrome version/OS?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:05:55] Version 29.0.1547.72 Mageia.Org 4 (220395)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:06:01] I haven't updated recently
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:06:15] (Linux)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:06:24] im in Version 29.0.1547.76 m on windows
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[23:07:50] Me either, just started a cauldron update. 938 packages, lol.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:10:02] im guessing, but it may be that chrome in windows treats characters it doesnt expect to appear as part of words differently in some way.  http://jsfiddle.net/pZs6u/1/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:10:23] ankh: matter of interest, is the & kerned any differently in that second fiddle?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:10:53] yes
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:10:57] wait
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:11:41] 2nd filldle much better in chromium
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:11:53] if instead of span you put an extra word space it comes out right too
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:12:03] might be a bug in the font
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:12:09] it could be
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:12:32] i'm hoping it's the browser
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:15:21] Adobe Garamond Pro doesn't have the problem
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:16:16] neither does Adobe Caslon Pro
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:16:41] and book antiqua is also ok
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[23:17:12] http://jsfiddle.net/wy2B9/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:18:28] none of those have kerning
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:25:49] it is a bug in the font i think
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:18:19] pingu2, they do have kerning here
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:18:21] when enabled
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:18:27] but not the bad & behaviour
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[01:21:27] ankh: sorry, i meant the 3 lines in the last jsfiddle didn't
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[01:21:54] are you talking about web font versions?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:33:04] no, I used the desktop versions
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:33:35] hmm, no kerning in firefox
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:33:52] 3rd line has kerning in chromium
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:34:08] this font stuff has been changing recently though
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[01:34:21] I think a new draft of the css fonts spec will be out soon
2013-10-06 09:57:39	 *	ankh [01:34:24] goes for coffee
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[01:56:27] i needed one too
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[01:57:57] yep, it's all brand new.  i read something about a font-kerning css property http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-kerning-prop.  i've not tested that
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[02:00:49] it was mainly just an experimental feature added to this application ive been working on
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[02:03:23] http://fontcombiner.com/ .  it was possibly too advanced anyway.  it's supposed to fill a niche as fun tool for drop-in fonts.  might be better to keep it simple.  (id really value feedback on that btw - anyone who might be set up to test)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[02:14:07] getting the metrics right for drop-in fonts is hard
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[02:14:35] I can see demand especially for clip-art and symbol fonts though
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[02:14:43] or for subsetting a single font
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[02:17:20] working through the metrics was exhausting
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:18:30] i fixed my ampersand problem
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:19:30] What was it?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:22:23] im still not completely sure, but it turns out that if you create a subset that doesn't include a lowercase 'b', ampersands are ignored in webkit.  i suspect it's something to do with the language tags used in the gpos table
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:23:15] partly guessing.  the docs and specs on this stuff seem to be endless
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:27:36] a stab in the dark really.  possibly something to do with b as the second of a pair in latin script?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:28:32] So adding the b to the kerning table fixed it?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:29:36] seems to. there's some kerned text on the home page.  i don't want to keep pasting the url in case it looks like spam to freenode
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:30:19] People do get crazy of little things. ;)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:30:27] s/of/over/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:31:57] safari was removing the & completely.  no way that isn't a bug.  it should at least fall back to another font
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:32:21] I noticed a few days ago that no all of my fonts work as web fonts. Luckily I have a lot to choose from.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:32:49] do you code a lot of websites?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:33:08] Not if I can help it.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:34:18] I've set up hundreds of sites over the years. That's actually fun. Dealing with customers is not.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:35:43] agree, yep.  'up a bit, down a bit.  more red please.  no, i dont like it, can you change it back?' 4 hours gone
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:36:23] it would suit me to stick to serverside work if i could find enough
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:36:26] One group was trying to get me to correct pdf's the provided to me.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:36:39] *they
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:41:00] You've got me looking at my font again. Kerning needs much work, but I have a few months before version freeze. Been lazy, my bad.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:41:56] do you have it online?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:42:41] You can download it from mageia cauldron, iirc.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:43:44] This is from my site: http://bit.ly/12b3bcI
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:46:03] nice.  actually using it on the site?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:46:21] I use it everywhere. Best way to debug.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:47:10] It's my system font too. Different sizes kern differently. I need lot's of input to sort this.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:48:01] kerning would make a difference.  e.g. Projects in the nav on the left
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:48:48] It came up on your links as the fallback and noticed that bold caps are kerned wrong....
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:48:48] i'm not sure kerning in browsers can be trusted yet
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:50:07] Before I found ttfautohint, was going crazy trying to get it working at small sizes. That's when I did the most damage to the kerning table. Still cleaning that up.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[11:50:48] browsers just use the same font stuff as the rest of the desktop don't they? why would kerning be different
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:51:13] pabs3: no, every one is different
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[11:52:01] The different sizes have different grid fitting. 1 pixel this way or that makes a difference.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[11:52:03] so they reimplement kerning using different code rather than just using the OS font code? weird
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[11:55:10] oh, specifically kerning rather than kerning, metrics, hinting?  from what i've seen, any browsers that support kerning at all seem to use gpos tables.  no clue how they go about it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[12:01:53] firefox, chrome and IE all seem to render things differently, though.  slight differences in spacing, and the AA seems to vary a lot
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[12:04:18] oh this is on Windows?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[12:05:25] No IE in linux. Not sure about mac, heard there was, never seen it.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:07:01] years ago there was
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:07:05] 3.5 iirc was the last
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:07:16] and I thinkChris Wilson may have been product manager for it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[12:07:17] Ah
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:07:55] kerning in browsers - the CSS for this, and the support, is changing
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[12:08:14] I can believe that.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:08:15] iirc at the last CSS F2F (in Paris in Setember) we voted to publish a new draft
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[12:15:03] I like what I've seen in the new standards. More control over font appearance would be even better :)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:15:42] yeah
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:16:07] but they are really working drafts right now
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:16:09] not standards
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:16:11] and liable to change
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[12:16:32] Of course.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[12:24:27] webkit seems to need a text-rendering property to enable kerning.  i think i read on MDN that this is supposed to relate to SVG and that FF dropped it completely
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[12:29:18] MS have -ms-font-feature-settings.  i guess it's all still quite new territory.  i have no vote, but if i did, i'd say this looks perfect http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-fonts/#propdef-font-kerning.  auto|normal|none
2013-10-06 09:57:39	ankh	[12:32:39] you don't have a formal vote but you can send comments to the working group
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:32:20] hi.  anyone around?  i just made a new tool.  http://cviewer.fontcombiner.com/
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:34:02] i was worried about copyright and licensing a bit, there didn't seem to be a web-based tool around, so i thought...  i could do that.  so i did : ).  i'd welcome feedback/suggestions, thoughts on whether it might be useful.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:34:55] Does it filter languages? Some font's have tonnes of support for that.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:35:35] im not sure.  how do you mean filter?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:36:27] Some I've looked at had support for dozens of languages in the name tables. Lot's of entries I could not read.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:36:37] oh
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:37:37] it's quite thrown together, but i think it should extract the whole lot.  it just shells ttx -t name and prints the unique entries to the page
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:38:23] There were a couple of commercial fonts that had a massive comments about the history behind the font in the name tables. Was interesting to read actually.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:38:36] i've seen one or two like that
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:38:57] I look for them, fun and means somebody really spent time on them.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:39:44] it must be a labour of love in some cases.  almost an insult that there isnt a dedicated web page for each one
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:40:37] could be a good wikipedia edits project for someone short of things to do
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:40:43] That's a nice tool.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:40:51] ttx, that is.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:41:11] yep, really handy
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:42:40] I had something a bit more primitive I use to populate my web library. Been meaning to bring it up to date at some time.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:43:44] i made that page on a different server at first, realised when i moved it over that there were some updates to ttx.  one was -o for and output file.  might be worth knowing about
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:43:57] *an
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:45:21] it'd be nice to get the data as standard output for interfacing with other scripts and tools.  i guess it's probably on the list
2013-10-06 09:57:39	diogenese	[22:50:40] Good to see so much interest. I mentioned that the term web font is somewhat new to me. I use most of my fonts for logos and artwork.
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:51:12] pingu2: writing to stdout isn't implemented yet, wasn't able to get that working before the latest release
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:51:53] try -o /dev/stdout but I think it requires a file, possibly it does seeks
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:52:26] patches welcome though
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:52:50] pabs3: i thought i read a note on it somewhere.  couldnt remember
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:53:02] would you like a credit on that web page btw?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:54:33] a link to either your code or the fonttools project page would be good
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:55:21] im a bit worried about detailing tools used server-side in case it's a prompt for an attack vector of some sort.  would you say ttx is reasonably safe with untrusted fonts?
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[22:56:20] my code is trivial.  just a bit of php and some domdocument stuff
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:57:01] I haven't done any hardening work on it
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:57:35] you might want to try doing some fuzzing with zzuf
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:59:04] seems to be safe from os.system and os.popen attacks. there is some eval use but it is wrapped in a function called safeEval (no idea how safe)
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:59:21] not sure what else to worry about in python code
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[22:59:42] but if you want to investigate that would be much appreciated
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pingu2	[23:00:37] it's probably ok.  i have it on a spare server, nothing too important on it.  ive added a credit/link
2013-10-06 09:57:39	pabs3	[23:01:26] great :)

2013-10-10 11:42:46	pingu2	i bounced a couple of emails with that guy (site author) about licensing for this application i made.  nice guy.  i imagine the industry-wide adoption of woff might lessen the need for google's CDN a bit
2013-10-10 11:47:51	pabs3	I would have thought the opposite, more woff adoption leads to more adoption of google's font cdn
2013-10-10 11:50:12	pingu2	perhaps, yep.  it could go either way.  i think one reason the cdn is so popular is/was the difficulty in covering all the different formats

2013-10-12 14:47:47	Ankh	what platform?
2013-10-12 14:48:09	yesyayen	sorry,  i thought no one would have noticed. My bad!!
2013-10-12 14:48:16	yesyayen	Ubuntu 13.04
2013-10-12 14:48:30	Ankh	isn't it in the repositories?
2013-10-12 14:49:22	Ankh	fontforge-1.0-0.20120731.6.mga4 here, admittedly over a year old
2013-10-12 14:49:49	yesyayen	i cloned the src from git
2013-10-12 14:50:27	Ankh	it's possible the git version is temporarily broken, depending on which branch you're compiling, I suppose
2013-10-12 14:50:55	Ankh	or that there's been a change to glib that breaks it, or that your glib is too old, I don't acually know, sorry
2013-10-12 14:51:58	yesyayen	oh, ok, thanks for ur inputs.. :)
2013-10-12 14:52:15	Ankh	there's a mailing list for it iirc

2013-10-15 11:12:37	pingu2	[11:42:46] i bounced a couple of emails with that guy (site author) about licensing for this application i made.  nice guy.  i imagine the industry-wide adoption of woff might lessen the need for google's CDN a bit
2013-10-15 11:12:37	pabs3	[11:47:51] I would have thought the opposite, more woff adoption leads to more adoption of google's font cdn
2013-10-15 11:12:37	pingu2	[11:50:12] perhaps, yep.  it could go either way.  i think one reason the cdn is so popular is/was the difficulty in covering all the different formats
2013-10-15 11:12:37	pabs3	[12:08:55] I dunno, their JS/jQuery CDN is pretty popular even though jQuery is easy to install/use
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[12:21:22] mmm?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	pabs3	[08:07:25] http://understandingfonts.com/blog/2013/10/atypi-day-2/

2013-10-15 11:12:37	yesyayen	[14:46:26] hi Ankh
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:47:41] you don't need to paste it twice :)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:47:47] what platform?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	yesyayen	[14:48:09] sorry,  i thought no one would have noticed. My bad!!
2013-10-15 11:12:37	yesyayen	[14:48:16] Ubuntu 13.04
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:48:30] isn't it in the repositories?
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:49:22] fontforge-1.0-0.20120731.6.mga4 here, admittedly over a year old
2013-10-15 11:12:37	yesyayen	[14:49:49] i cloned the src from git
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:50:27] it's possible the git version is temporarily broken, depending on which branch you're compiling, I suppose
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:50:55] or that there's been a change to glib that breaks it, or that your glib is too old, I don't acually know, sorry
2013-10-15 11:12:37	yesyayen	[14:51:58] oh, ok, thanks for ur inputs.. :)
2013-10-15 11:12:37	Ankh	[14:52:15] there's a mailing list for it iirc

2013-10-16 01:43:55	moyogo	lut_tul: what font format is it?
2013-10-16 02:00:52	Ankh	this is Adobe Small Font I think
2013-10-16 02:01:39	Ankh	you'd need to convert them to truetype
2013-10-16 02:02:02	Ankh	or so suggests http://us.generation-nt.com/answer/using-adobe-fonts-windows-forms-ui-help-25659982.html
2013-10-16 02:02:28	Ankh	(it's a bitmap font)
2013-10-16 02:06:43	lut_tul	oh
2013-10-16 02:06:50	lut_tul	How can i convert it?
2013-10-16 02:07:11	lut_tul	I want to use it so much. it takes less space and it is clear.
2013-10-16 02:08:03	pingu2	hi.  for my two pennies, i think you might be better off looking for something similar in a different font
2013-10-16 02:09:41	pingu2	if you take a look at fontsquirrel (or perhaps fontcombiner : ), you should find a load of OTF and TTF fonts with an OFL license
2013-10-16 02:11:38	pingu2	that might even be better for file size, because you'll be able to subset.  trim it down so that it only contains the characters you need
2013-10-16 02:12:29	lut_tul	could you please give me the link?
2013-10-16 02:14:20	pingu2	http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ (and this one with a disclaimer because it's my site: http://fontcombiner.com/ ) or a google search for free fonts.  http://cviewer.fontcombiner.com/ is a tool for viewing license info
2013-10-16 02:19:41	lut_tul	oh.thanks.
2013-10-16 02:19:46	Ankh	agree, better to find a different font - you may find the adobe font is not so clear on a display with different resolution, or looks really ugly
2013-10-16 02:20:00	Ankh	having said that, there are products that can convert
2013-10-16 02:31:47	lut_tul	Ankh
2013-10-16 02:32:19	lut_tul	if I want a kind of fonts similar to Latin
2013-10-16 02:32:24	lut_tul	or spanish

2013-10-16 03:16:04	lut_tul	yes.
2013-10-16 03:16:07	lut_tul	please
2013-10-16 03:16:28	pingu2	i did already.  font combiner can do that.  i dont know about the capitals
2013-10-16 03:16:36	pingu2	you can drag and drop to remap
2013-10-16 03:17:28	lut_tul	font combiner is complicated for me. I do not know how to use yet.
2013-10-16 03:19:57	pingu2	mm.  im sure you'll find something.  anything you do use, though, i'd suggest an open license font.  there's no need to use arial
2013-10-16 03:20:05	lut_tul	so could you send that file to me . the fil you did with font combiner?
2013-10-16 03:20:34	lut_tul	yes. any kind of font. I said Arial bcause I do not remember other kind of fonts.sorry.
2013-10-16 03:21:18	pingu2	i can't do that.  i can look to modfifying font combiner to make it easier to use
2013-10-16 03:22:07	lut_tul	oh
2013-10-16 03:22:09	pingu2	it should be easy.  just drag and drop characters from the source to the target (top/bottom), click generate and you can download the new font
2013-10-16 03:22:23	lut_tul	nice
2013-10-16 03:22:51	pingu2	i can't promise the new font will be perfect - there are still a few bugs to fix, but it should do most of what you need

2013-10-21 16:32:11	pingu2	i think fonts count as art.  i dont know, but i'd bet a lot of font designers have the artist mindset.  everyone needs to make a living, but id guess sometimes it's enough to see the work used and appreciated

2013-10-21 18:30:55	pingu2	i could be wrong, you may know more than i do, but i'm pretty sure text-rendering is on the cusp of obsolenscence for that purpose
2013-10-21 18:30:56	pingu2	do people say cusp on freenode?

2013-11-03 07:18:35	diogenese	More Alice in Wonderland. One of my projects uses it for examples too.
2013-11-03 07:19:45	pingu2	it beats lorem ipsum i think
2013-11-03 07:19:59	diogenese	I like it.
2013-11-03 07:20:19	pingu2	the demo, though, is that the one on the left is verela round straight from google fonts
2013-11-03 07:20:41	diogenese	Thought so. Fuzzier.
2013-11-03 07:20:43	pingu2	the one on the right is passed through this application i've been working on
2013-11-03 07:21:43	pingu2	i see similar results across most of the fonts google offer.  i think im about ready to write to a few magazine sites to see if i can get some exposure
2013-11-03 07:23:18	diogenese	Mine was worse before running it through ttfautohint. Amazing difference that makes.
2013-11-03 07:23:30	pingu2	definitely, yep, amazing stuff
2013-11-03 07:24:13	pingu2	a lot of google fonts use it from what i've seen
2013-11-03 07:24:38	diogenese	Still fighting with kerning. Learning a lot about grid fitting along the way as well. So many different results depending on situation.
2013-11-03 07:25:38	pingu2	this is a reason i chose some alice, actually.  i thought it was poignant.  fonts generally seem to be quite the rabbit hole
2013-11-03 07:26:16	pingu2	i dare not count the hours i've spent doing research
2013-11-03 07:26:28	diogenese	It think of it like working on a rock garden. Never perfect, but can always get closer.
2013-11-03 07:26:32	diogenese	*I
2013-11-03 07:27:22	pingu2	vertical metrics are another big can of worms
2013-11-03 07:28:11	diogenese	I've been around fonts a long time. Only just tried to make my own a few years ago. Worked in printing for a long while.
2013-11-03 07:28:57	pingu2	i havent.  i've been around a lot of code and media formats, but i've had to learn about fonts for this one project.
2013-11-03 07:31:36	diogenese	There are nice tools these days to help out with that. I guess copyright issues kept coders at bay for a long while.
2013-11-03 07:32:15	pingu2	it looks that way
2013-11-03 07:33:07	pingu2	that and type design is quite clique, i think, at least potentially
2013-11-03 07:33:46	pingu2	design of glyph forms and all that, as opposed to the code side of font construction
2013-11-03 07:33:46	diogenese	I've had a tool for a long while that extracts information from ttf, but never took any further and getting what I needed to display them on a web page. After collecting more than 1000, got hard to remember what they all looked like.
2013-11-03 07:34:46	diogenese	s/and/than/
2013-11-03 07:34:51	pingu2	the system i'm using in this application is a process of extracting each glyph as a vector shape
2013-11-03 07:35:14	pingu2	nothing is retained from the original except the copyright
2013-11-03 07:35:36	diogenese	I never went that far. Was thinking about it.
2013-11-03 07:36:34	pingu2	im big on svg at the moment.  i do quite a bit of web code, and i think the format is likely to take off in a big way some time soon.  (svg images as opposed to svg fonts)
2013-11-03 07:36:50	pingu2	there's quite a bit of overlap i've found
2013-11-03 07:37:27	diogenese	Had an idea of rendering each glyph and order by density. Anything to help identify them. Right now can render samples 8000 up, to only takes 8 pages to scan them all.
2013-11-03 07:37:32	pingu2	oddly, eps and fonts use an inverted coordinates system
2013-11-03 07:38:36	diogenese	Err 10 pages, 8000 up. I've collected many over the years.
2013-11-03 07:38:52	pingu2	8000 glyphs?
2013-11-03 07:39:00	diogenese	80,000 fonts
2013-11-03 07:39:14	pingu2	all open license?
2013-11-03 07:39:16	diogenese	give or take.
2013-11-03 07:39:39	pingu2	i think font licenses probably need to be changed
2013-11-03 07:40:58	diogenese	No, all kinds of licenses. I know my sister is big on them being free. She's a professional designer and companies won't take her works if it uses commercial.
2013-11-03 07:41:51	pingu2	i gather the licensing restrictions were conceived in hand with the technology used at the time to produce a font as software.  im not sure any font would be granted a patent or similar as a set of glyph forms standing alone
2013-11-03 07:43:12	diogenese	Was about the rewrite that tool when I noticed all the activity in the font world. Started hanging out here and still thinking about it. Might be an easier way :)
2013-11-03 07:43:41	pingu2	i've been really careful with this application to only use open license and to retain the copyrights.  i suspect that if i had the money or influence to dispute any legal challenges, i could probably make quite a case against the need to
2013-11-03 07:45:25	diogenese	I'm more interested in sorting and classifying what I have. A lot of dingbats and really poor fonts. A good many of commercial. That's what I need done right now. Will have to wait till I'm done with my current project.
2013-11-03 07:45:44	pingu2	i guess the thing is, from my perspective anyway, it's a bit like books or novels.  if type designers don't get paid, they'll stop making fonts.  i imagine the analogue of an author whose books are offered for free to everyone
2013-11-03 07:46:15	diogenese	True. It's good they get paid.
2013-11-03 07:46:39	pingu2	i think something needs an overhaul
2013-11-03 07:46:39	diogenese	Another reason I need to sort out commercial from free.
2013-11-03 07:54:49	 *	Ankh has a lot of fonts too, fontmatrix is one of the more helpful Linux programs to sort them
2013-11-03 07:58:16	pingu2	are you using anything special in linux for font rendering?
2013-11-03 07:59:24	diogenese	Ankh: I don't have fontmatrix. I think you mentioned it before. I'll look for it. Thanks.
2013-11-03 08:00:07	pingu2	i had some guy helping me with some screenshots from linux (my lin tests focused mainly on metrics and that).  i think they might have been using this http://www.infinality.net/blog/
2013-11-03 08:01:12	pingu2	looks really good.  my opinion of linux font rendering has always been that it's a bit rubbish, but from what i've seen, with the right set up, lin can put both windows and osx to shame

2013-11-03 09:30:49	Ankh	infinality pathes interesting
2013-11-03 09:30:52	Ankh	good luck with art cruise
2013-11-03 09:31:44	Ankh	pingu2, a problem with screnshots is that font rendering is monitor- and viewer- specific
2013-11-03 09:32:17	pingu2	Ankh: yep, with you
2013-11-03 09:58:16	pingu2	Ankh: i've just been attempting a more objective demo/comparison showing the fonts in use as opposed to screenshots.  i'd really value your feedback if you're interested: http://fontcombiner.com/docs/whyfontcombiner

2013-11-03 10:15:42	 *	Ankh looks
2013-11-03 10:16:20	Ankh	in Demo 1 the left-hand text is crisp and readable, the right-hand one darker, softer, slightly blurry
2013-11-03 10:16:56	Ankh	similarly in Demo 2 the left would be better except its lower case i is too fat
2013-11-03 10:17:10	Ankh	the right-hand one is much darkr
2013-11-03 10:18:27	Ankh	letter spacing is uneven on both examples, e.g. for agerage, the "i" is to far to the left in its space, and on the right it's too far to the right. Or rather, it doesn't have enough of a side-bearing on the right
2013-11-03 10:19:39	Ankh	(there is still some room for change in CSS font-kerning, quite a bit of change in fact is likely for level 4)
2013-11-03 10:20:29	Ankh	a lot probably depends on the screen though
2013-11-03 10:20:32	pingu2	Ankh: thanks.  which OS and browser?
2013-11-03 10:20:46	Ankh	Mageia Linux 4 (beta)
2013-11-03 10:20:51	Ankh	or alpha, I forget :)
2013-11-03 10:20:58	pingu2	interesting
2013-11-03 10:20:59	Ankh	and, tht was firefox
2013-11-03 10:21:07	Ankh	24.1.0
2013-11-03 10:21:27	pingu2	the one on the right seems way better in chrome 30 on windows
2013-11-03 10:21:34	Ankh	in chromium there's much less of a difference
2013-11-03 10:22:08	Ankh	the "fa" in falling in Demo 2 has too much space in the right-hand column
2013-11-03 10:22:25	Ankh	chromium 30.0.1599.66
2013-11-03 10:22:44	pingu2	i don't think there's any kerning info in either font
2013-11-03 10:26:15	pingu2	thanks for the feedback, it's valuable (though im not sure you're a representative sample - you may have typographers eyes : ). interestingly something like 90% of the visits on the site have been windows chrome so far
2013-11-03 10:26:50	Ankh	http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/fontcombiner.png
2013-11-03 10:30:12	pingu2	thanks.  i see.  that's some lovely rendering
2013-11-03 10:30:31	pingu2	this is chrome windows http://webgel.net/bf/chrome30_windows7_average.png
2013-11-03 10:30:48	Ankh	eww, yeah, big difference
2013-11-03 10:31:01	pingu2	and the other http://webgel.net/bf/chrome30_windows7.png
2013-11-03 10:31:44	Ankh	the "fa" pair is slightly better on the left there too
2013-11-03 10:32:01	pingu2	i noticed that
2013-11-03 10:34:06	pingu2	i considered trying to demo one with kerning applied http://jsfiddle.net/rfaJ7/embedded/result/
2013-11-03 10:35:15	Ankh	left is much darker, different enough to make me question that it's the same font
2013-11-03 10:36:04	pingu2	interesting.  that's roboto.  i suspect that automated kerning and hinting like that is likely to make any pro's eyes bleed, but it seems to add something good in windows
2013-11-03 10:36:45	Ankh	e.g. the top of "a" is a different shape, k joins to the step directly on the left but has a stalk on the right
2013-11-03 10:37:17	Ankh	middle of w comes to a point on the left and is full step width on the right
2013-11-03 10:37:25	diogenese	and the 'n' is totally different.
2013-11-03 10:37:46	Ankh	well, the bottom-right of the n has a blurry flare on the right
2013-11-03 10:37:47	pingu2	oh. i didnt mix up the files did i?  i may have
2013-11-03 10:38:24	Ankh	there are similarities but if you're moving the height of the crossbar on "e" that's quite a change
2013-11-03 10:39:29	pingu2	assuming i didnt mess up and mix up my files, i suspect that sort of difference may be hinting?
2013-11-03 10:40:23	Ankh	it seems a bit too much fornhinting (and right-hand k is a disaster if so)
2013-11-03 10:43:08	Ankh	er, "for hinting" not "fornhinting"
2013-11-03 10:45:43	pingu2	i did mess up, i think.  http://jsfiddle.net/rfaJ7/3/embedded/result/
2013-11-03 10:46:01	pingu2	i don't think the one on the left was linked properly.  i may have had it cached
2013-11-03 10:46:21	Ankh	that's looking mor eplausible
2013-11-03 10:46:26	Ankh	maybe it was a test :-)
2013-11-03 10:46:37	pingu2	i'll pretend it was
2013-11-03 10:47:27	Ankh	right-hand is better than left-hand now
2013-11-03 10:47:57	pingu2	oh, that's good.  im undecided in windows
2013-11-03 10:49:02	pingu2	in the testing version left was probably falling back to a local font
2013-11-03 10:49:16	Ankh	could be, I didn't check
2013-11-03 10:52:11	 *	Ankh off for a bit
2013-11-03 10:52:30	pingu2	k.  thanks for the help

2013-11-09 12:06:01	pingu2	pabs3: debian 3.2?
2013-11-09 12:06:48	pabs3	he is talking about the version of the Linux kernel that he is using
2013-11-09 12:07:02	pingu2	oh
2013-11-09 12:07:11	pabs3	Debian versions are like 7.2 or 6.0.1
2013-11-09 12:07:26	pingu2	i thought that sounded odd
2013-11-09 12:07:56	pabs3	it isn't particularly surprising that font rendering uses CPU, interesting to see it quantified
2013-11-09 12:08:29	diogenese	Makes sense.
2013-11-09 12:08:30	pingu2	oh, that's what it's about?  i was struggling to follow it
2013-11-09 12:08:59	pingu2	so an example might be scrolling text while compiling?
2013-11-09 12:09:47	pingu2	http://jsfiddle.net/pXc5U/
2013-11-09 12:11:27	pingu2	(the jsfiddle is unrelated.  just thought i'd share while there were people around)
2013-11-09 12:13:09	pingu2	to that article on scroll performance, is a loop with no timeout or sleep a good test?
2013-11-09 12:15:49	JanC	pabs3: *she*, not *he*  :)
2013-11-09 12:16:09	pabs3	woops!
2013-11-09 12:16:30	pingu2	i think i'd want a second test with a 'sleep' of some number of ms just to verify.  it could be some sort of bottleneck unrelated to normal scrolling output (ie, other than a line printed for every possible iteration of a loop that does nothing but print that line)?
2013-11-09 12:17:24	 *	pabs3 makes mental note to use 'they' more
2013-11-09 12:17:51	diogenese	So hard to get that right. The language is gender biased.
2013-11-09 12:18:45	JanC	"Shallow Sky" is Akkana Peck's blog
2013-11-09 12:23:49	pingu2	i posted a comment
2013-11-09 12:24:55	pingu2	not to be picky, but im not 100% convinced it's a vaild test
2013-11-09 12:24:55	diogenese	She wrote a font tool too. :)
2013-11-09 12:25:06	pabs3	at least we aren't talking in Spanish is here :)

2013-11-09 12:32:27	diogenese	:)
2013-11-09 12:33:07	akk	Hi -- I heard there was discussion of my scrolling performance blog post. :)
2013-11-09 12:33:19	pingu2	the 'man herself
2013-11-09 12:33:24	akk	heh
2013-11-09 12:33:28	diogenese	Yes, we were just chatting about it. :)
2013-11-09 12:33:51	akk	I'm running a version with a short sleep (.001 sec) but I'm not sure what to test it against or what that would tell me.
2013-11-09 12:34:49	akk	Actually one thing I should look at is CPU load while I'm running the test with rendering.
2013-11-09 12:35:11	diogenese	I've been concerned about it since I like to view the compile output live. Does seem to slow things down.
2013-11-09 12:35:55	akk	I suspect compiler output doesn't slow things too much unless all the files are really tiny. Surely the disk overhead is much more than the few lines printed per file?
2013-11-09 12:36:20	JanC	unless most files are cached
2013-11-09 12:36:21	akk	(thought about trying to test that but then you have to worry about caching being different between tests)
2013-11-09 12:37:28	diogenese	Disk overhead is small. The run takes around 3 days, 6 cores at about 80%. Tonnes of files are processed and I like to see exactly what's going on.
2013-11-09 12:37:33	akk	Hmm, what's a good CPU meter that doesn't require all the gnomey (or kdey) stuff? I haven't used one in a while.
2013-11-09 12:38:19	akk	One that shows all the cores.
2013-11-09 12:38:48	diogenese	I have one. Conky rocks :)
2013-11-09 12:39:17	pingu2	perhaps atop?
2013-11-09 12:39:19	JanC	well, htop can also show that
2013-11-09 12:39:20	akk	I do still have a .conkyrc, maybe it still works. (Took me quite a while to figure out how to set it up, that's not an intuitive program.)
2013-11-09 12:39:34	JanC	in a terminal
2013-11-09 12:41:21	diogenese	This has my meter: http://www.flickr.com/photos/warrendiogenese/10587569324/
2013-11-09 12:41:25	akk	With xterm visible and scrolling, conky shows both cores at about 35-40%
2013-11-09 12:41:34	pingu2	must forgive my slapdash comment bleary-eyed at 4am.  i just imagined perhaps the test wasnt realistic without a sleep
2013-11-09 12:41:48	akk	(seems strange that this simple python script would use almost exactly the same cpu for both, though)
2013-11-09 12:42:25	JanC	akk: unless it's Xorg using those cores...
2013-11-09 12:42:38	akk	htop shows x first, xterm second, my script third while it's running and displaying visibly
2013-11-09 12:42:45	akk	so maybe it's X on one core, xterm on the other
2013-11-09 12:42:46	JanC	or the terminal emulator
2013-11-09 12:43:04	akk	The script, however, is under 10% consistently
2013-11-09 12:43:09	akk	all the CPU is going to X and xterm
2013-11-09 12:43:20	akk	so I don't think it's that the CPU load from rendering is making python run slowly.
2013-11-09 12:43:30	JanC	which indicates a bottle neck in displaying the scrolling text, I would say
2013-11-09 12:43:33	akk	(which was the question in the blog comment, right?)
2013-11-09 12:44:00	pingu2	is it waiting for the rendering to catch up?
2013-11-09 12:44:03	-->	aravindavk (aravinda@nat/redhat/x-ivqfsmqqyvsdmdxx) has joined ##fonts
2013-11-09 12:44:57	akk	Interesting: With the xterm hidden, X and xterm are still the top two, the script is still only third,
2013-11-09 12:45:08	akk	but this time the script is getting about 30% of CPU instead of under 10%.
2013-11-09 12:45:36	akk	Maybe because xterm is constantly querying X, "am I visible?" "am I visible?" but then choosing not to render?
2013-11-09 12:45:49	diogenese	That's a definite bottleneck. If I pipe output to a log file and run tail on that, tail can continue for a minute or so after the compile is finished. I would expect it to wait otherwise.
2013-11-09 12:45:50	JanC	the script is writing to stdout, I assume, so it probably blocks when some terminal I/O buffer is filled?
2013-11-09 12:46:18	akk	Yes, the script writes to stdout
2013-11-09 12:46:35	akk	and evidently does block (that was the original question I had)
2013-11-09 12:47:20	pingu2	maybe a bottleneck does cause problems in real use. i was imagining it trying to print half a million lines in a few ms or something, though.  not sure that wouldn't skew the numbers
2013-11-09 12:47:22	JanC	and it blocks longer when the terminal does more work
2013-11-09 12:48:02	akk	xterm is apparently semi-smart about skipping lines (compared to the console, say) but not smart enough.
2013-11-09 12:48:08	JanC	e.g. framebuffer console has zero hardware acceleration

2013-11-09 12:54:17	akk	That would eliminate the question of whether it was CPU load slowing down the program (I think?) if I ssh into another machine to run the script.
2013-11-09 12:55:11	JanC	that would most likely introduce additional slow-downs because of the network?
2013-11-09 12:56:04	akk	True, but if the program ran slower because it was blocking for the network, that would answer the question too, wouldn't it?
2013-11-09 12:56:15	akk	That it was blocking on output and not just running slower because of CPU load.
2013-11-09 12:57:08	akk	Interesting, the ssh process is getting 7% CPU, almost as much as the python script was getting before, just to transfer all the output lines.
2013-11-09 12:57:16	JanC	running the script with output redirected to /dev/null as a comparison might be useful too
2013-11-09 12:57:29	akk	True. I'll do that too.
2013-11-09 12:58:06	JanC	but, as you say the CPU is not running at 100%, so it can't really be the CPU slowing down the script
2013-11-09 12:58:17	JanC	or at least not much
2013-11-09 12:58:56	JanC	the script would take all the available CPU time on one core if it could
2013-11-09 12:58:58	akk	60.29 sec printing over ssh (LAN) to a visible xterm; 7.24 sec doing the same thing with xterm hidden;
2013-11-09 12:59:14	akk	oh, whoops, I can't test it to /dev/null without making the times print to stderr instead of stdout :)
2013-11-09 13:00:06	akk	.57 seconds to a /tmp file (on root, not in ram)
2013-11-09 13:00:35	pingu2	is that with a sleep?
2013-11-09 13:00:53	akk	.49 sec on the original machine where I did the earlier tests (it's a little faster than the one I'm ssh'ed to)
2013-11-09 13:00:58	akk	No sleep, no.
2013-11-09 13:01:10	JanC	well, that's essentially writing to RAM (filesystem buffers) if the output isn't too big
2013-11-09 13:01:13	akk	I started a test with a sleep and then realized it wasn't telling me anything -- what would I set the sleep to?
2013-11-09 13:01:30	akk	Of course if you put in a sleep, the time will be 500000*sleeptime
2013-11-09 13:01:57	akk	JanC: True, guess it doesn't matter that the filesystem is on disk.
2013-11-09 13:02:09	akk	Good excuse not to bother modifying the program for the /dev/null test :)
2013-11-09 13:02:12	pingu2	i think a sleep of any length might rule out the cpu as a contributor
2013-11-09 13:02:18	akk	(seriously, that's easy, might as well do it)
2013-11-09 13:02:58	akk	pingu2: So e.g. compare that it takes 1000000 sec vs 1000060 depending on whether the xterm is visible?
2013-11-09 13:03:56	JanC	so, I would say that if the program doesn't finish within 1 sec, it is blocking on something  :)
2013-11-09 13:04:03	pingu2	maybe.  i think perhaps just a few ms sleep on each iteration.  i'd be interested to know if the results vary by the same percentage
2013-11-09 13:04:23	akk	.55 seconds (on the slower sshed machine) to /dev/null, so very close to the same as a /tmp file.
2013-11-09 13:05:20	akk	pingu2: Okay, hold on, I'll try that.
2013-11-09 13:05:37	pingu2	i guess it's hard to know if cpu usage shown < 100% in a performance monitor really means the cpu isn't the bottlneck.  might not be accurate, perhaps threading makes a difference.  im only guessing
2013-11-09 13:06:15	akk	I put in a time.sleep .001
2013-11-09 13:06:46	akk	I suspect what this is testing, though, is whether xterm+X can render one line in .001 sec.
2013-11-09 13:06:53	akk	If it can, then no blockage.
2013-11-09 13:07:28	akk	I mean, if the sleep was 1 second, then obviously it's going to take the same amount of time whether or not the xterm is visible, right?
2013-11-09 13:07:38	pingu2	im betting 50p that the differences will be less marked
2013-11-09 13:07:55	akk	(shoot, it's only 1/5 of the way through, this is taking forever at 1msec)
2013-11-09 13:08:13	akk	Also, at .001 sec, xterm is not having much trouble keeping up -- I don't see those blank spaces I saw before.
2013-11-09 13:08:27	JanC	it's going to take > 1000 sec, of course  ;)
2013-11-09 13:08:59	JanC	or whatever times you sleep
2013-11-09 13:09:03	akk	pingu2: Sure, they'll be less marked, but that doesn't tell us whether the script was CPU blocked, only that it was blocked for less time because the lines had finished printing. No?
2013-11-09 13:09:07	pingu2	maybe .0001 would be the same test.  dont feel like you have to on my account
2013-11-09 13:09:09	JanC	500 sec maybe
2013-11-09 13:09:57	pingu2	not sure
2013-11-09 13:10:18	akk	I'm going to bet that there'll be very little difference between the visible and invisible run.
2013-11-09 13:10:28	akk	BTW, the CPU isn't nearly as busy with this sleep.
2013-11-09 13:10:39	akk	It's getting a rest between each line, I think.
2013-11-09 13:11:34	akk	I'm not actually sure how granular python's time.sleep is. Does it use select? select can only sleep in milliseconds, right?
2013-11-09 13:11:40	akk	(3/5 through now)
2013-11-09 13:12:16	pingu2	dont know
2013-11-09 13:12:37	pingu2	i wouldnt be surprised if the timers vary across systems though(?)
2013-11-09 13:12:40	akk	I'm not gonna kill this after waiting this long :)
2013-11-09 13:12:52	akk	but I'll try .00001 once the run finishes.
2013-11-09 13:12:54	diogenese	:)
2013-11-09 13:13:12	akk	er, .0001, got a few too many zeroes there
2013-11-09 13:13:20	JanC	in any case, I think you showed libvte (the terminal widget used in gnome-terminal and the xfce terminal, and several others) could use some more intelligent behaviour when hidden  :)
2013-11-09 13:13:36	akk	Definitely!
2013-11-09 13:13:38	pingu2	i think perhaps just anything so that the cpu might not be locked into a loop trying to do everything as fast as it possibly can
2013-11-09 13:13:48	akk	I was happy that xterm was fairly smart about it.
2013-11-09 13:13:48	<--	Leftmost (~leftmostc@wiktionary/Leftmostcat) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2013-11-09 13:14:01	akk	Should have tried rxvt and xfterm too, didn't think of it.
2013-11-09 13:14:11	akk	I think the kde terminal has about 167896789678 dependencies.
2013-11-09 13:14:42	JanC	xfce terminal uses libvte too, so that will probably behave the same
2013-11-09 13:15:23	akk	And I used to use rxvt, don't know why I didn't think to try it. But at least I gave the tools so anybody can try the experiment in their own favorite terminal.
2013-11-09 13:15:46	akk	555.72 seconds with time.sleep(.001) and xterm visble the whole time.
2013-11-09 13:16:30	akk	That's good -- it's on the order of 10x the time it took without the sleep just to render the lines.
2013-11-09 13:16:33	-->	Leftmost (~leftmostc@wiktionary/Leftmostcat) has joined ##fonts
2013-11-09 13:16:40	JanC	right, so that's 500 sec sleep + 55 sec which is close enough to the 56 sec you saw before
2013-11-09 13:16:54	akk	So I'm trying .0001 now, which should be a good test (assuming python's time.sleep has that granularity).
2013-11-09 13:17:03	akk	Looks like it does, we're halfway through.
2013-11-09 13:17:33	JanC	you could also sleep .001 every 10 iterations or such  :)
2013-11-09 13:17:40	akk	Good point.
2013-11-09 13:18:14	JanC	(I think the sleep granularity depends on the hardware platform)
2013-11-09 13:18:18	akk	Now this is interesting! 104.71 sec with .0001 and xterm visible. Trying now with it shaded.
2013-11-09 13:18:41	JanC	that's 50 + 54
2013-11-09 13:18:45	akk	It's like it blocked for the line and then did the sleep.
2013-11-09 13:18:48	akk	Which makes no sense.
2013-11-09 13:19:03	akk	Conky showed both CPUs are pretty even.
2013-11-09 13:19:15	pingu2	im interested in .0001 on another desktop
2013-11-09 13:19:30	akk	In this run, with xterm hidden, CPU1 is using more than CPU0 (I'm guessing X and the script are on 0 and xterm is on 1, but I don't know how to tell).
2013-11-09 13:19:39	JanC	that's 54, 55 or 56 sec for the actual script without the sleeps
2013-11-09 13:19:44	pingu2	8/56 vs xx/104.71
2013-11-09 13:20:43	JanC	which means the displaying is not delayed by the CPU-time from the script, seems to me
2013-11-09 13:20:56	akk	98.36 with xterm shaded.
2013-11-09 13:21:01	JanC	or at least not significantly
2013-11-09 13:21:32	akk	only 6 seconds difference
2013-11-09 13:21:33	akk	that is very weird
2013-11-09 13:21:45	JanC	akk: heh, so that means it's slower with the sleeps?  :)
2013-11-09 13:21:53	akk	yeah. This makes no sense.
2013-11-09 13:22:12	akk	Wait, no, it does make sense
2013-11-09 13:22:16	JanC	or maybe the sleeps aren't accurate enough
2013-11-09 13:22:22	akk	right, it's what I predicted, duh :)
2013-11-09 13:22:40	akk	that there's little difference between the times if the sleep gives it a chance to wait for the output rather than blocking.
2013-11-09 13:22:49	akk	Let me try it to /dev/null
2013-11-09 13:22:59	pingu2	so it's 8.5/56, 0.15 (or 85% faster), vs 98.36/104.71, 0.93 (or 7% faster)?
2013-11-09 13:23:44	akk	To /dev/null, conky doesn't show any CPU load at all.
2013-11-09 13:24:02	akk	htop shows the script at 11% cpu
2013-11-09 13:24:29	JanC	depends on the sampling interval & such probably
2013-11-09 13:24:33	akk	(ah, there actually are a few pixels down there at the bottom of CPU0 in conky)
2013-11-09 13:24:47	akk	97.44 seconds to /dev/null
2013-11-09 13:25:02	akk	so xterm shaded was only a second slower than /dev/null
2013-11-09 13:25:07	akk	(with sleeps)
2013-11-09 13:25:39	pingu2	does that prove anything?  im finding it hard to picture.  i guess that still amounts to text scrolling faster than real-world?
2013-11-09 13:25:52	JanC	somehow sleeps aren't accurate enough it seems to me
2013-11-09 13:27:40	akk	I think it means that it takes approximately .0001 + 6/500000 seconds to print a line in a visible xterm. :)
2013-11-09 13:28:09	akk	(if we wait for .0001 sec, then the extra time the visible xterm took was 6 seconds for 500000 lines)
2013-11-09 13:28:31	akk	(vs. the invisible xterm, which had to do some processing but no actual rendering)
2013-11-09 13:29:02	akk	Of course that's not quite right since the total time was so different with and without the sleeps, and I'm not sure what to make of that.
2013-11-09 13:34:59	JanC	try with .OO1 sec sleeps every 10 iterations, if that doesn't give more or less the same result as .0001, you are probably hitting timer accuracy limits
2013-11-09 13:35:46	akk	Okay, trying that ...
2013-11-09 13:36:05	akk	It looks a lot faster, just offhand
2013-11-09 13:36:19	akk	but maybe that's me getting tired (will be retiring for the evening soon)
2013-11-09 13:36:48	JanC	I should do that too, it's 6h30 over here  :P
2013-11-09 13:36:56	akk	Ah, it is different.
2013-11-09 13:37:02	JanC	except, that would be retiring for the morning  :)
2013-11-09 13:37:05	akk	65.05 with xterm visible.
2013-11-09 13:37:29	akk	JanC: I thought maybe you were up early!
2013-11-09 13:38:12	pingu2	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1133857/how-accurate-is-pythons-time-sleep
2013-11-09 13:38:20	akk	57.12 to /dev/null
2013-11-09 13:38:36	pingu2	you could try a sleep for as little as it can do, 0.000001 say
2013-11-09 13:38:46	JanC	and with hidden xterm?
2013-11-09 13:39:03	akk	running now
2013-11-09 13:39:52	akk	63.36
2013-11-09 13:40:14	akk	So different numbers but similar qualitative results, I think.
2013-11-09 13:40:44	JanC	that's with 50 sec sleep included
2013-11-09 13:40:45	pingu2	could you do one more with sleep set to the absolute minimum?
2013-11-09 13:40:59	akk	0.000001 is the minimum?
2013-11-09 13:41:00	pingu2	visible vs any of the 8 seconds ones
2013-11-09 13:41:07	pingu2	i dont know
2013-11-09 13:41:36	akk	Trying with 0.000001
2013-11-09 13:42:16	JanC	akk: most likely .001 is the best the kernel can do, and even then it's not always accurate...
2013-11-09 13:42:27	akk	JanC: I suspect you're right.
2013-11-09 13:42:55	pingu2	the accuracy may not make much difference
2013-11-09 13:43:12	JanC	pingu2: it certainly does
2013-11-09 13:43:19	pingu2	im thinking that anything at all that might free up a few cpu cycles might change the numbers
2013-11-09 13:43:27	akk	Argh! the visible-xterm run finished, but then I started the /dev/null run but missed the > so I don't have a time on the visible run.
2013-11-09 13:43:50	akk	But to /dev/null it was 0.65 sec with 0.000001 sleep
2013-11-09 13:43:54	akk	re-running the visible test
2013-11-09 13:44:14	JanC	pingu2: it will round sleep times up to the smallest "timer tick"
2013-11-09 13:44:22	akk	(It got to 6800 lines before I hit ^C which was way past my xterm's scrollback buffer)
2013-11-09 13:44:31	pingu2	what was /dev/null without the sleep?
2013-11-09 13:44:42	akk	60.36 with xterm visible
2013-11-09 13:44:51	JanC	or maybe it will round down in some cases
2013-11-09 13:44:57	akk	with no sleep /dev/null is .48
2013-11-09 13:45:31	pingu2	i've forgotten what we're trying to prove
2013-11-09 13:45:58	akk	(0.650718927383 - 0.482533931732) / 500000 is 0.000000336369991302 which is not .000001
2013-11-09 13:46:12	akk	so the timer isn't very accurate in that range
2013-11-09 13:46:26	JanC	looks like it rounded down in most but not all cases  :)
2013-11-09 13:46:32	akk	but I'm finding I'm not very accurate any more either, so I think I should probably retire for the evening :)
2013-11-09 13:46:44	akk	but I'll be back tomorrow, if anybody has any more ideas for things I should test!
2013-11-09 13:47:09	akk	Of course I'll write this all up, but I'll wait 'til we've discussed it more -- this is probably worth a followup article rather than trying to cram it all into a comment reply.
2013-11-09 13:47:22	pingu2	.48/56 vs .65/60.36.  .0086 vs .0101
2013-11-09 13:48:27	akk	G'night, talk to you tomorrow! And thanks for bringing this up, it's a lot of fun to try tracking down what's really happening here.
2013-11-09 13:48:41	pingu2	bye

2013-11-11 19:17:59	pingu2	this is unpublished http://fontcombiner.com/docs/fontscaling .  i dont have a linux firefox handy.  im interested to know if the font-size-adjust implementation matches windows
2013-11-11 19:19:03	pingu2	there seems to be an odd quirk where the unstyled (or invisible, i think depending on a timeout)...  the unstyled text is sized to the inverse of the font-size-adjust value
2013-11-11 19:19:56	pingu2	if lin is anything like windows, you should notice that the third box with a blue border is larger than the other two before the fonts display

2013-11-12 10:42:17	pingu2	my opinion is that attempts at good spacing characters are quite fruitless, at least in current browsers
2013-11-12 10:42:24	pingu2	*characteristics
2013-11-12 10:42:45	pingu2	there's too much variation across platforms, browsers and zoom levels
2013-11-12 10:53:30	pingu2	lovely rendering in modern internet explorer, though.  it'd be nice to see chrome or webkit switch to directwrite
2013-11-12 11:14:25	Ankh	sorry, back
2013-11-12 11:14:48	Ankh	the goal of the kerning & shoulder metrics is to get an optically equal amount of space between letters
2013-11-12 11:15:09	Ankh	so your WA are too cloee in WAR, and OE should be closer than NE
2013-11-12 11:19:05	pingu2	Ankh: with you, yep.  maybe i went too far trying to demonstrate that it was actually kerned
2013-11-12 11:20:06	Ankh	perhaps :-)
2013-11-12 11:22:02	pingu2	i've put kerning on the back burner a bit. i think it's going to be a while before the big web font providers start to push it through
2013-11-12 11:22:58	pingu2	i think i've fixed the tracking a bit. just been putting together some demos with more realistic amounts of text http://fontcombiner.com/docs/loremipsum
2013-11-12 11:24:49	pingu2	i know it's not perfect, but for free web fonts redoing all the spacing auto, i think it's quite good
2013-11-12 11:25:51	Ankh	yeah, it's looking better
2013-11-12 11:27:28	pingu2	i dont know if you have, but if you view this one in windows and google chrome http://fontcombiner.com/docs/whyfontcombiner, you might be quite shocked at how poorly google's versions seem to render
2013-11-12 11:27:47	Ankh	no windows here
2013-11-12 11:30:12	pingu2	this is a problem i'm finding, and i suspect it's one of the main reasons google's (or the google font dev's) efforts don't measure up
2013-11-12 11:30:12	pingu2	there's a huge bias towards osx and linux in design and coder circles
2013-11-12 11:31:31	pingu2	perhaps just unaware of the problems in windows (which make up the majority of visits on most sites outside of those circles)
2013-11-12 11:32:01	pingu2	*from viewers outside of
2013-11-12 11:33:09	Ankh	yes, apple targets designers explicitly
2013-11-12 11:33:21	Ankh	and the Web came out of unix :)
2013-11-12 11:35:03	pingu2	from what i've seen comparing like-for-like, ie, a rubbish/typical monitor hooked up to osx, windows font rendering is superior to osx with the right font
2013-11-12 11:35:48	Ankh	yeah, it always has been, because Apple's font rendering was printermatched
2013-11-12 11:36:09	Ankh	as appropriate for print designers
2013-11-12 11:36:22	pingu2	i gather a lot of people think osx gives better results
2013-11-12 11:36:30	pingu2	ah
2013-11-12 11:37:12	Ankh	"better" is subjective
2013-11-12 11:37:23	Ankh	and safari has different defaults for CSS rendering-intent too
2013-11-12 11:39:01	pingu2	'better' is also tied to the hardware quite a bit, i guess.  apple make lovely monitors and comps
2013-11-12 11:39:40	pingu2	i'd need to google rendering intent

2013-11-12 11:51:26	Ankh	I'm an XML person :)

2013-11-12 11:54:07	pingu2	i don't know if i should be spamming you with my various mini sites, but there's one here with a really minimal colour picker top right http://chrono-lab.com/

2013-11-15 13:29:29	pingu2	how about this http://i.imgur.com/UUUkJ2A.png
2013-11-15 13:30:07	pingu2	im writing up some stuff about character separation, thought it might be interesting
2013-11-15 13:30:51	pingu2	that's a lowercase b against a vertical line
2013-11-15 13:32:02	pingu2	the mid point of the polynomial approximates optical separation
2013-11-15 13:34:20	pingu2	considering updating the algorithm used on my font thing for spacing.  a few graphs could be pretty. i find it kind of interesting seeing it in a visual form
2013-11-15 13:37:25	pingu2	i might do a couple of letters against nothing or |, and then show how the graphs vary depending on the pair, say b against c
2013-11-15 13:44:57	pingu2	i could almost do a standalone tool for viewing these graphs for all glyphs in a font uploaded (something like that 'cviewer' thing i did).  i don't know if it might be useful for people who make fonts
2013-11-15 13:46:30	pingu2	maybe a project for a rainy day
2013-11-15 13:46:31	pabs3	I don't make fonts so I'm not sure either
2013-11-15 13:47:25	pingu2	i gather it's one of the trickiest aspects

2013-11-24 22:59:20	donri	this problem is most apparent in gvim which renders font in a fixed width cell grid, so some unicode glyphs end up half-way outside the cell

2013-11-30 03:58:55	moyogo	hi behdad
2013-11-30 04:00:49	behdad	moyogo: hey
2013-11-30 04:00:59	behdad	moyogo: long time!
2013-11-30 04:02:55	moyogo	indeed :D
2013-11-30 04:12:41	behdad	moyogo: so what are you up to these days?
2013-11-30 04:14:39	behdad	moyogo: how many fonts do you guys have in your library?  can you round trip them all?
2013-11-30 04:14:53	moyogo	I should try that
2013-11-30 04:15:33	moyogo	comparing the ttx files from python2 and python3, the floats are different
2013-11-30 04:21:04	behdad	moyogo: I thought I fixed the floats.  Which parts?
2013-11-30 04:22:13	behdad	moyogo: also.  now that XML is utf-8, I like to change name table handling to dump strings in unicode
2013-11-30 04:22:27	behdad	only dump in bytes if the decoding fails.
2013-11-30 04:49:11	moyogo	ok, I can't reproduce the float difference I had this morning
2013-11-30 04:50:09	moyogo	python 3.3.2 is complaining about import __future__ must be first and fonttools/misc/transform.py
2013-11-30 05:01:40	behdad	moyogo: weird.  my python also says it wants it first, but didn't catch that one.
2013-11-30 05:01:46	behdad	oh, perhaps because it's not used by ttLib
2013-11-30 05:02:09	behdad	moyogo: how do you catch these?
2013-11-30 05:02:17	behdad	I also want to do some pychecker runs
2013-11-30 05:02:58	behdad	moyogo: if you don't have any other patches, can you start with a clean fork and continue there?
2013-11-30 05:03:10	moyogo	they just show up with python3 setup.py install actually
2013-11-30 05:03:14	moyogo	sure I’ll do that
2013-11-30 05:03:25	behdad	ah ok, I never used setup.py
2013-11-30 05:04:07	behdad	moyogo: also, feel free (read: I encourage you!) to make micro commits.  ie. one commit per one logical change
2013-11-30 05:04:21	behdad	They make reviewing, reworking commits, and bisecting MUCH easier.
2013-11-30 05:05:24	behdad	also, do you know how I can instruct setup.py to run doccheck's?
2013-11-30 05:07:08	behdad	moyogo: should I merge 2and3 into master?
2013-11-30 05:10:22	behdad	Ok, I'm merging now, so we can go back to normal workflows
2013-11-30 05:10:30	moyogo	ok
2013-11-30 05:11:33	behdad	moyogo: Done.  Thanks for the help!
2013-11-30 05:11:44	behdad	moyogo: any comments re the name table comments above?
2013-11-30 05:12:28	moyogo	utf-8?
2013-11-30 05:12:52	moyogo	yeah it makes sense
2013-11-30 05:13:06	behdad	yeah.
2013-11-30 05:13:07	behdad	ok, cool.
2013-11-30 05:13:22	behdad	I want to get a feel of how much people actually care about file format stability.
2013-11-30 05:13:41	behdad	I don't intend to break it, but some people are categorically against any change at all :)
2013-11-30 05:14:24	behdad	moyogo: so, how's the subsetter performing?
2013-11-30 05:15:02	moyogo	we've tested it with some fonts and we're happy with it
2013-11-30 05:15:04	behdad	did you notice the speedup patches I pushed out last week at all?  With Noto Sans it was taking quite a while (say, 200ms to subset to a single glyph)
2013-11-30 05:15:14	behdad	let me know if it ever barfs or something.
2013-11-30 05:15:25	moyogo	no, we haven't tried the latest version in production yet
2013-11-30 05:15:52	moyogo	200ms what?
2013-11-30 05:17:02	behdad	moyogo: time pyftsubset NotoSans-Regular.ttf a
2013-11-30 05:21:31	moyogo	ok, i get around 0.150ms after the first time
2013-11-30 05:22:20	moyogo	150ms i mean :)

2013-11-30 07:12:03	pingu2	hi
2013-11-30 07:14:44	behdad	pabs3: hey.
2013-11-30 07:14:47	behdad	still around?
2013-11-30 07:16:35	pabs3	yep
2013-11-30 07:17:29	behdad	hey, how's going?
2013-11-30 07:18:04	behdad	pabs3: so.  I was planning to clean up and upstream my changes chunk by chunk.
2013-11-30 07:18:19	behdad	But at this time, the changes are so many that I don't think I ever will get to rework them.
2013-11-30 07:18:28	behdad	So, what do you think we should do?
2013-11-30 07:19:15	pabs3	hmm
2013-11-30 07:20:03	behdad	The good thing is that your tree isn't moving that much, so I can track it.
2013-11-30 07:21:32	behdad	I've considered moving the subsetter and inspect tools out of the tree.  but really, those are not a big deal at all, as those are just two isolated files, like all the other isolated files that have been in the repo unused...
2013-11-30 07:21:37	behdad	(which I've cleaned up in my tree)
2013-11-30 07:21:55	behdad	So I think the question is, do you even care to go over my tree and review the non-subsetter changes?
2013-11-30 07:22:14	behdad	I understand that some people prefer to use a slow moving tree...
2013-11-30 07:22:31	behdad	But many are also using mine exactly because I've been fixing so much stuff
2013-11-30 07:22:45	behdad	Sure, I broke some stuff in the short term, but have cleaned those all up.
2013-11-30 07:23:16	pabs3	TBH I am just a distro maintainer who got sucked into the project because Just was inactive. I kinda dropped the ball on poking him the past few years

2013-11-30 07:23:49	behdad	Ok, if you don't have any strong feelings here, I'll just go ahead and rename my tree, call it v3, and roll a tarball
2013-11-30 07:23:56	pabs3	involved in too many projects :(
2013-11-30 07:23:58	behdad	and let distros and people pick whatever tree they want
2013-11-30 07:26:28	pingu2	trees and distros.  i miss linux
2013-11-30 07:28:26	pingu2	actually, no, i don't.  i take that back.  i swear i must have spent about 5 hours the other morning installing a tool on a server
2013-11-30 07:30:09	pingu2	it's a really important job, though, packages.  i would be more lost if i had to compile everything.
2013-11-30 07:30:15	pabs3	behdad: I'd actually prefer to see it merged but I think the project needs some work (test suites, round-trip stuff) before we can think about merging anything but trivial patches, I'm not confident about being able to know if things got broken by changes. I also don't have the time or knowledge to do these things
2013-11-30 07:32:20	behdad	pabs3: I'm working on those things too.
2013-11-30 07:32:35	behdad	Ok, so, perhaps, in the mean time lets just let things happen the way they are.
2013-11-30 07:32:44	behdad	I just wanted to make sure there's no hard feelings.
2013-11-30 07:33:11	pabs3	no definitely not :)
2013-11-30 07:33:16	behdad	Because, if you merge Andrew's py3 changes, the two trees would become unmergable short of someone checking every line of diff...
2013-11-30 07:33:32	behdad	Cool.  Lets just let things happen they way they are then.
2013-11-30 07:33:54	pabs3	yeah. about splitting the tools, I tend to think that is a bit silly unless ttx itself gets moved out
2013-11-30 07:34:10	behdad	Right.
2013-11-30 07:34:13	pabs3	pingu2: btw, we are talking about fonttools (and the google fork of it) here
2013-11-30 07:34:36	pabs3	pingu2 is using fonttools on a web fonts thing

2013-11-30 07:39:00	pingu2	i think i did experiment with fonttools a few years ago as part of an early concept for that font combiner application
2013-11-30 07:39:54	pingu2	xml parsing may have been a bit heavy.  it uses fontforge at the mo
2013-11-30 07:41:09	behdad	I started implementing a font merging tool in fonttools
2013-11-30 07:41:38	pingu2	did you get anywhere?
2013-11-30 07:43:47	pabs3	pingu2: what does the main site use?
2013-11-30 07:44:13	pingu2	fontforge as the main workhorse
2013-11-30 07:44:29	pingu2	quite a list of other little tools for extras
2013-11-30 07:44:55	behdad	pingu2: it's in the merge branch of my tree.  It's very early right now.  WIll get back to it.
2013-11-30 07:46:16	pingu2	i think there probably is room for a good subsetter or some sort of combiner that can merge and maintain metrics
2013-11-30 07:46:21	pabs3	hrm, dave/just still haven't given me access to the pypi projects
2013-11-30 07:47:26	pingu2	the way i did was to extract every glyph as an individual.  they're measured, the metrics get redone
2013-11-30 07:48:05	pingu2	quite a can of worms.  it depends on auto character spacing and there's no way to preserve kerning
2013-11-30 07:52:41	pingu2	thoughts on metrics here if interested http://fontcombiner.com/docs/metrics
2013-11-30 07:53:54	behdad	Thanks.  Will check.
2013-11-30 07:55:44	pingu2	i'd love to see the big guys drive through something similar.  adobe, google.  i think metrics and scaling consistency could add quite a bit to the industry.  this is a cool demo http://fontcombiner.com/docs/fontscaling

2013-11-30 08:17:26	Ankh	pingu2, who exactly are you hoping will do what exactly with respect to metrics??
2013-11-30 08:28:33	pingu2	Ankh: with half a bottle of red consumed, gone midnight on a friday : ).  i think i'd like to see the main providers of web fonts (or any group with the weight to push changes) set a fixed standard for vertical metrics relating to line height, and perhaps some sort of standard relating to overall vertical sizing
2013-11-30 08:32:24	Ankh	and then you'd like Web browsers to use that?
2013-11-30 08:32:45	Ankh	do we need changes to CSS, pingu2?
2013-11-30 08:33:55	davelab6	pingu2: usually vmetrics sum to no more than 125% of em size
2013-11-30 08:34:26	davelab6	it could make sense to enforce 1000 upm and 1200 bbox
2013-11-30 08:34:41	pingu2	Ankh: i think those aspects to fonts might be beyond the scope of css specs
2013-11-30 08:34:58	Ankh	i'm not sure why theu would be out of scope
2013-11-30 08:35:09	Ankh	if you're wanting a change to browser behaviour, it has to be specified somewhere, no
2013-11-30 08:35:09	Ankh	?
2013-11-30 08:35:22	davelab6	Ankh: because when in CSS you say '12pt' or '10px' or whatever
2013-11-30 08:35:36	davelab6	Ankh: the font's vertical metrics are scaled to that unit
2013-11-30 08:35:51	Ankh	yyyyes
2013-11-30 08:35:54	davelab6	Ankh: the CSS specs dont cover font vertical metrics, those are spec'd by OFF
2013-11-30 08:36:18	davelab6	Ankh: and there are 3 sets of v metrics
2013-11-30 08:36:34	davelab6	Ankh: google's standard is to set all 3 the same, to the bbox of the box
2013-11-30 08:36:38	davelab6	of the font*
2013-11-30 08:37:03	davelab6	to avoid clipping
2013-11-30 08:37:21	Ankh	I took pingu2 as wanting a change to browser behaviour - we can't really change existing fonts except very very slowly
2013-11-30 08:37:39	davelab6	Ankh: but this results in a wide variety of optical sizes, the 2nd point
2013-11-30 08:37:40	Ankh	sometimes you _want_ overlapping tendrils
2013-11-30 08:38:01	davelab6	Ankh: right, but then linespacing: -0.5em etc
2013-11-30 08:38:06	Ankh	agree optical sizes vary a lot; i don't think there's a good solution to that
2013-11-30 08:38:36	pingu2	i think browser behaviour is good, generally.  i know there are difficulties relating to line height and which sets of values to use
2013-11-30 08:38:47	Ankh	i suspect text level 4 will indeed end up giving more control over line height, just as we (CSS WG) have added access to e.g. opentype features
2013-11-30 08:41:12	pingu2	example, pasting the same link for context http://fontcombiner.com/docs/metrics, scroll to the bit marked technical at the bottom (forgive and marketing spin)
2013-11-30 08:46:17	pingu2	metrics are so convoluted at the moment that it'd boggle anyone's mind.  i don't have a solution, only an idea that some sort of simplification or a modern definitive spec might make everyone's life a little easier

2013-11-30 08:58:04	pingu2	reminds me of the old b&w -> tv problem they faced way back when.  im sure there's an interesting story there somewhere
2013-11-30 08:58:12	pingu2	*->colour tv
2013-11-30 08:58:56	Ankh	backward compatibility is indeed part of standards development
2013-11-30 09:00:06	pingu2	perhaps we're reaching a stage where web browsers are to word processors or print as hd video streams are to tv
2013-11-30 09:02:16	Ankh	if you mean that the open web platform is commoditizing typography then i think i agree
2013-11-30 09:02:26	 *	Ankh just ran a workshop on that subject in fact
2013-11-30 09:27:14	pingu2	Ankh: any conclusions as to the reasons for that?

2013-11-30 09:48:48	pingu2	i think i just meant that we may be reaching a stage where we can draw a line under the need to support old or competing standards.  perhaps we needn't be tied apple of microsoft's metrics specs of the 90's.  now that it's all open, maybe it's time for something new and universal/fied
2013-11-30 09:53:19	pabs3	I don't think "it's all open" is correct, still plenty of traditional font foundries and proprietary/sourceless fonts
2013-11-30 09:53:58	pabs3	based on the output of the recent conf (atyple?) there is a lot of resistance from the proprietary font world
2013-11-30 09:54:37	pingu2	i think there will always be a place for really unique fonts designed for a purpose
2013-11-30 09:55:34	pabs3	indeed, those don't need to be proprietary though...
2013-11-30 09:56:11	pabs3	since (I guess) they'll be produced on a commission basis
2013-11-30 09:56:25	pingu2	the difficulty type designers face i guess, at least the way i understand it, is that in its modern form, it's not really licensable
2013-11-30 09:58:06	pingu2	i know that with enough corporate weight and the right suited lawyer, you can patent a piece of fruit, but fundamentally, without the software as part of it, algorithms, the techy side, we are talking about licensing letter shapes
2013-11-30 09:58:29	pingu2	and that doesn't really stand up

2013-11-30 10:08:07	pingu2	i was going to say that i think perhaps an open web prompting some commoditisation of typography could be an aknowledgment in itself that the industry as we know it is on borrowed time.  i guess that commoditsation is mainly in the form of a service to take the pain out of catering for a million different standards
2013-11-30 10:09:29	pingu2	i dont see any advantages in offsite/third-party font hosting, personally, so long as there's only one format
2013-11-30 10:14:43	pingu2	i would make a sketchy prediction that both google and adobe will need to move away from the CDN approach at some point, and i suppose that would break the model for profit

2013-12-14 06:20:20	emhs	Hey, folks. I'm helping a client who is working with a lawyer who is entirely too committed to the roman.fon font that comes with windows. I'm trying to convert it to a ttf using fontforge, but fontforge won't open it.
2013-12-14 06:20:28	emhs	Any tips on mangling the thing properly?
2013-12-14 06:24:57	pingu2	hi
2013-12-14 06:26:04	pingu2	emhs: i'm not the best person to answer.  there are others lurking who will know way more than i do, but just so you get a response
2013-12-14 06:26:13	emhs	pingu2: Thanks.
2013-12-14 06:26:32	pingu2	my answer would be that i don't think you can
2013-12-14 06:26:38	emhs	Also, a close stand-in for the windows font Roman Regular would do.
2013-12-14 06:27:11	pingu2	that would be my approach i think
2013-12-14 06:27:30	pingu2	find a close match.  that should be easy enough
2013-12-14 06:30:15	pingu2	times new roman?

2013-12-14 06:32:01	emhs	The irritating bit is it looks like CA Superior Court requires "Roman" for civil writs.

2013-12-14 07:03:40	emhs	Thanks!

2013-12-28 08:25:01	pabs3	for those of you who run Windows/MacOS, could you help me out with a Debian font-related thing? we need a list of non-free fonts from your OS and some of their metadata so that we can automatically detect and reject packages including them: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=298545#24
2013-12-28 08:27:54	pingu2	pabs3: i probably have both.  not sure how to go about getting a list though
2013-12-28 08:28:47	pingu2	i guess one approach might be to check the dvd isos, extract from the cabs or whatever they use these days
2013-12-28 08:28:50	pabs3	I expect all fonts are stored in one directory, a list of filenames and md5sums should be easy to get?
2013-12-28 08:29:09	pingu2	my windows will have loads of extras
2013-12-28 08:29:16	pabs3	ah
2013-12-28 08:29:33	pabs3	wouldn't they be installed outside the OS fonts dir?
2013-12-28 08:29:57	pingu2	not in windows.  not sure on mac.  windows is my main]
2013-12-28 08:30:06	pabs3	ok, ok
2013-12-28 08:30:36	pabs3	I wonder if there is an easy way to detect the foundry
2013-12-28 08:30:46	pabs3	if this was Linux a quick grep could probably do it
2013-12-28 08:30:51	pingu2	perhaps grab an iso or two?
2013-12-28 08:31:17	pabs3	sounds like a good idea if you have them
2013-12-28 08:31:51	pingu2	i do, but bit torrents would probably do it, or maybe just a trial/beta version straight from MS?
2013-12-28 08:33:02	pabs3	maybe I'll just grep the pkg-fonts review for common names: http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/
2013-12-28 08:33:53	pingu2	isn't there a flag in the fonts?
2013-12-28 08:34:04	pabs3	what kind of flag?
2013-12-28 08:34:51	pingu2	sec, just googling
2013-12-28 08:35:23	pingu2	it might just be called the embedding flag
2013-12-28 08:36:36	pingu2	fsType
2013-12-28 08:36:52	pabs3	that is set on plenty of fonts that are actually FLOSS
2013-12-28 08:37:33	pingu2	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms753303(v=vs.110).aspx "You can retrieve the font embedding rights for a font by creating a GlyphTypeface object and referencing its EmbeddingRights property. Refer to the "OS/2 and Windows Metrics" section of the OpenType Specification for more information on the fsType flag."
2013-12-28 08:37:38	pingu2	don't know if that helps
2013-12-28 08:38:27	pabs3	hmm, this says it is Verdana but doesn't look like Verdana: http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/fnt-5b812b0e563d0ecb1850e3e13e2b0072.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Verdana_sample.svg
2013-12-28 08:39:03	pingu2	it doesn't look quite right does it? : )
2013-12-28 08:39:52	pingu2	maybe they opened up verdana as a base before importing their own glyphs?
2013-12-28 08:40:23	pabs3	that would make it a derived work of verdana and illegal?
2013-12-28 08:41:12	pingu2	i don't know.  from what i've seen working on my project, font licensing generally is a shambles
2013-12-28 08:42:22	pabs3	haha, there is a font called arial.ttf that is actually DejaVu Sans: http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/fnt-cf97099cda1780556368aef7257dd9a7.html
2013-12-28 08:42:23	pingu2	i guess if that's how that happened, it probably just means the name tables are wrong
2013-12-28 08:43:40	pingu2	maybe a hash is the only way
2013-12-28 08:44:08	pabs3	yeah
2013-12-28 08:44:16	pabs3	well, I'll report a bug about this
2013-12-28 09:15:04	JanC	pabs3: that Ethopool/Verdana thing seems to list conflicting names, isn't that enough to set off a warning?  or is it something very common in good fonts too?
2013-12-28 09:15:47	pabs3	there are no warnings yet, we are still working out if we have a problem and how to detect it if so
2013-12-28 09:17:00	JanC	pabs3: I mean, would that be enough to trigger a still to be made warning system  :)
2013-12-28 09:17:55	pabs3	depends on the checks to be written :)
2013-12-28 09:18:14	pabs3	I would expect there are very few sane fonts when it comes to licensing
2013-12-28 09:18:47	pabs3	while grepping, I came across this, does it look like Verdana? http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/non-free-font-checks/unpacked/usr/share/games/pingus/data/images/fonts/verdana11.png
2013-12-28 09:20:57	JanC	hard to say at such a small font size and without having it installed right now, but it could be, I think
2013-12-28 09:21:53	pabs3	looks like it was generated from something else: http://sources.debian.net/src/pingus/0.7.6-1.1/data/images/fonts/README
2013-12-28 09:23:51	pabs3	this is the most bizarro thing I've seen, font metadata converted to perl code: http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/non-free-font-checks/unpacked/usr/share/perl5/PDF/API2/Resource/Font/CoreFont/webdings.pm
2013-12-28 09:25:20	 *	pabs3 wonders what kind of font this is http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/review/non-free-font-checks/unpacked/usr/share/radiance/Verdana.fnt
2013-12-28 09:31:00	JanC	pingu2: I'm not sure how a hash would help with modified fonts?
2013-12-28 09:41:36	pingu2	hm
2013-12-28 09:41:52	pabs3	it wouldn't
2013-12-28 09:41:58	pingu2	isn't that the point?
2013-12-28 09:42:12	pingu2	you want to let modified through?
2013-12-28 09:42:35	pabs3	no but we can't detect those automatically
2013-12-28 09:42:46	pabs3	ok there are definitely some non-free fonts here: http://sources.debian.net/src/root-system/5.34.14-1/fonts
2013-12-28 09:44:24	pingu2	how about those distributed with say ghostscript?
2013-12-28 09:44:40	pingu2	aren't non-free sometimes donated or given?
2013-12-28 09:47:40	pingu2	i gather freeness depends a lot on usage.  i don't envy debian people
2013-12-28 09:47:47	pabs3	anyone know who owns the BlackChancery font?
2013-12-28 09:48:05	pingu2	i know of a tool that might tell you
2013-12-28 09:48:08	pabs3	freeness depends solely on the copyright/license status
2013-12-28 09:48:35	pabs3	and sometimes on source, but that is almost always impossible to tell with fonts
2013-12-28 09:49:17	pingu2	there's this whole overlap with display and print, i think, when it comes to outlines or glyph shapes vs the font software
2013-12-28 09:50:50	pingu2	varies per country.  e.g. (just from my reading - no experience with laws) svg isn't licensable, fonts embedded as outlines in an eps or pdf, all outside of the scope
2013-12-28 09:52:14	pingu2	it's a problem for me.  imagine you've made a tool that extracts only those outlines and creates a new font from the shapes
2013-12-28 09:54:28	pabs3	oh right, I forget that some things aren't copyrightable
2013-12-28 09:56:15	pingu2	i think things like that are probably coprightable, the way a drawing might be, but not licensable like a piece of software
2013-12-28 09:57:56	pabs3	wut?
2013-12-28 10:00:19	pingu2	who knows
2013-12-28 10:01:14	pingu2	the colour blue is probably patentable with the right calibre of lawyers to push it through
2013-12-28 10:09:11	pabs3	it doesn't make any sense for something to be copyrightable but not licensable, copyright law is what gives you the right to restrict a work and thus control other people's use of it through licensing
2013-12-28 10:19:09	pingu2	i'm probably mixing up my terms
2013-12-28 10:27:04	JanC	pabs3: seems like BlackChancery was designed by Doug Miles as a public domain bitmap font and traced to vectors by him & Earl Allen (in 1993?), but both of their personal websites disappeared from the web...
2013-12-28 10:28:57	pabs3	yeah, just saw that from the dafont.com site
2013-12-28 10:31:42	JanC	I also found other & older references
2013-12-28 10:32:18	JanC	although I would have prefered a personal site or such
2013-12-28 10:33:02	pabs3	maybe archive.org has them?
2013-12-28 10:42:00	pabs3	hmm, none of the root-system font md5sums correspond to either the Windows 7 fonts or the Microsoft Core Web Fonts
2013-12-28 10:42:15	 *	pabs3 tries WinXP
2013-12-28 10:44:20	pabs3	hmm, I don't have WinXP any more, does anyone else?
2013-12-28 11:01:35	JanC	http://sources.debian.net/src/root-system/5.34.14-1/debian/README.Debian#L236
2013-12-28 11:04:25	pabs3	yeah, they are still distributed in the source package though, which isn't allowed either
2013-12-28 11:06:44	JanC	but should be easy to complain about, as they already know  :)

2013-12-28 11:21:58	Ankh	pingu2, note that typeface designs _are_ covered by copyright (to a varying extent) in a number of countries outside the US though
2013-12-28 11:22:17	Ankh	and what do you mean by "svg isn't licensable"?
2013-12-28 11:44:35	pingu2	Ankh: in the context of font software, because it's all just vector shapes
2013-12-28 11:47:53	pingu2	i think i read somewhere that in the early stages of font licensing, there was debate over whether fonts were something that could be licensed at all.  they decided they could be, because with all the code and programming involved, it fell under software
2013-12-28 11:50:11	pingu2	i don't know how they decide.  imagine you find some nice glyphs in a book, or a magazine on caligraphy, say, copy the outlines and make them into a font.  i guess that's a different bracket of intellectual property.
2013-12-28 12:00:00	pingu2	say some software company release a font using a format completely independent of MS or apple specs, using nothing but the glyph shapes.  i imagine that could prompt a legal case if the shapes were identical.  i did read about some sort of law suit that used the shapes alone as evidence
2013-12-28 12:12:07	pingu2	i'd be interested to see a good debate on it, outside of the legal stuff.  can you really restrict someone's rights to use a particular shape for a letter in the alphabet?  if you can, are the shapes copyright as individuals, and if not, how many do you need before it's a font and something different?
2013-12-28 12:34:33	pabs3	copyright is a legal construct, so the second question doesn't make much sense outside of legal stuff
2013-12-28 12:39:07	pingu2	*outside of vested interests and corporate weight, i guess i meant to say

2013-12-28 15:36:30	Ankh	wb pingu2
2013-12-28 15:37:03	Ankh	I think you're confused about the differences between copyright, licences, patents
2013-12-28 15:37:35	Ankh	glyph shapes (including in SVG) are covered by copyright law in (say) the UK, but not in the US
2013-12-28 15:38:24	Ankh	the TrueType "programs" that implement typeface designs can be covered by design patents in the US (but not atomatically, getting coverage costs money)
2013-12-28 15:39:59	Ankh	a license is a sort of contract between two parties, and can say more or less anything (as long as it's legal), so i could licence a font to you under th condition you not redistribute it, even if it's neither patented nor covered by copyright law - that's the EULA
2013-12-28 15:43:11	pingu2	hi
2013-12-28 15:43:54	pingu2	that sounds right
2013-12-28 15:47:44	pingu2	i think there may be a difference between US and UK when it comes to using fonts in logos.  don't know.  it may just may that the US have precendents
2013-12-28 15:48:10	pingu2	not here again a min
2013-12-28 15:51:56	Ankh	typefaces are I think protected for 25 years from publication in the UK, so not as long as other creative works

2013-12-28 16:52:05	pingu2	i don't know where they draw the line with EULAs.  this is an absurd stretch, but imagine i tried to write up a license to allow you to mow your lawn with the same stripe pattern as mine
2013-12-28 16:53:38	pingu2	that sort of thing must get a bit hazy when it comes to what's enforceable and what isn't.  licensed to have 2.1 spoonfuls of sugar in a coffee : )
2013-12-28 16:56:04	pingu2	font and glyph shapes are more legit, but it's possibly still a bit of a stretch depending on particulars.  i guess perhaps depending on how unique or elaborate
2013-12-28 16:57:58	Ankh	well
2013-12-28 16:58:04	Ankh	if you buy a lawn mower from me
2013-12-28 16:58:17	Ankh	and the contract you sign says you won't mow your lawn in stripes
2013-12-28 16:58:25	Ankh	now you are bound by tht contract
2013-12-28 16:58:51	pingu2	mm, i get your point i think. yep
2013-12-28 16:58:55	Ankh	a contract between two parties, such as an end user license, is totally unrelated to copyright
2013-12-28 16:59:56	Ankh	copyright says the person responsible for the original creative work is in control of who can make derivative works, in order to give people an incentive to write books, make art, etc
2013-12-28 17:00:52	Ankh	before copyright was invented in england in 1750 or so, if I wrote a successful book, there'd be another publisher selling their edition of my book within a few weeks, and i wouldn't get much money
2013-12-28 17:02:25	pingu2	i'm reminded of a story about the protestant reformation, and perhaps pirate bay
2013-12-28 17:02:40	Ankh	I didn't know pirate bay was involved in the reformation :)
2013-12-28 17:03:54	pingu2	there was a guy who invented the telescope in italy.  i forget his name, i'd need to google.  he published a book about the nature of the solar system, the sun at the centre and all that stuff
2013-12-28 17:04:26	Ankh	referring to galileo and copernicus?
2013-12-28 17:04:34	pingu2	this was during the reformation.  the catholic church jumped in to block it
2013-12-28 17:04:39	pingu2	sec, i'll google
2013-12-28 17:06:48	pingu2	yep, galileo i think
2013-12-28 17:07:09	Ankh	the roman catholic church pardoned him recently
2013-12-28 17:07:15	pingu2	oh
2013-12-28 17:07:15	Ankh	and now they are working on copernicus
2013-12-28 17:07:29	pingu2	interesting
2013-12-28 17:09:20	pingu2	mm.  links to pirate bay.  they blocked it, and suddenly it was forbidden knowledge, all over the media/pulpits, whatever they had back then and everyone wanted to know what it was about
2013-12-28 17:09:33	Ankh	ah. yes.
2013-12-28 17:09:43	Ankh	like banning a book, makes it sell really well
2013-12-28 17:09:55	pingu2	yep, i guess it would
2013-12-28 17:10:26	Ankh	ok, 4am here
2013-12-28 17:10:36	Ankh	time to take the dogs out and go to bed :)
2013-12-28 17:10:47	pingu2	ok then.  nice chatting.  bye
2013-12-28 17:10:53	Ankh	night
2013-12-28 18:25:05	JanC	Ankh: in 1750 it would take that other printer at least half a year to print your book (some books took up to 3 years to print!)  :)
2013-12-28 18:26:08	JanC	but yeah, printing was cheaper than hand-writing & -illustrating  :)

2014-01-11 05:43:52	contempt	is this the right place to ask about fonts installation in Linux?
2014-01-11 06:29:53	Ankh	contempt, ask and we'll tell you :)
2014-01-11 06:30:40	Ankh	on most GNU/Linux[™] Distributions, putting fonts into ~/.fonts/ will be enough to install them for that user, if they are truetype or opentype or type 1 fonts
2014-01-11 06:31:22	Ankh	http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Search/?kw=fonts
2014-01-11 06:59:56	contempt	Ankh: I would like to know if I'm actually using gohufont
2014-01-11 07:02:19	Ankh	fc-list | grep -i gohu, will show if it's installed
2014-01-11 07:02:45	contempt	fc-list | grep -i gohu  and xlsfonts | grep -i gohu find it
2014-01-11 07:03:28	contempt	I have this in .Xdefaults (I use urxvt) URxvt*font: -gohu-gohufont-medium-*
2014-01-11 07:03:48	Ankh	ok, and, if you're using gnome. Character Map (gucharmap) can show you if it's used for particular characters/codepoints
2014-01-11 07:04:09	contempt	no, I'm using ratpoison
2014-01-11 07:04:22	Ankh	well, well, ratpoison is a window manager
2014-01-11 07:04:43	contempt	yes, no desktop environment
2014-01-11 07:04:46	Ankh	and gnome is a desktop environment; gnome 2 can use a lot of different window managers.
2014-01-11 07:05:04	Ankh	anyway, ok, try gucharmap maybe (if it's installed)
2014-01-11 07:05:58	Ankh	is this gohufont a truetype font?
2014-01-11 07:07:19	contempt	Ankh: how can I check? the description says it's a bitmap font
2014-01-11 07:07:39	Ankh	try, urxvt -fn xft:gohu:pixelsize=15
2014-01-11 07:07:48	Ankh	where gohu is the name as it appears in your grep command
2014-01-11 07:08:05	Ankh	what's the exact filename?
2014-01-11 07:08:31	Ankh	wow, I see it, it's tiny
2014-01-11 07:08:53	Ankh	which format did you download?
2014-01-11 07:08:58	Ankh	pcf?
2014-01-11 07:09:04	contempt	yes pcf
2014-01-11 07:09:58	contempt	http://sprunge.us/DMDV
2014-01-11 07:10:15	Ankh	yeah, ok
2014-01-11 07:10:23	contempt	I've followed this http://keilhau.org/customizing-linux.html
2014-01-11 07:10:27	Ankh	urxvt -fn xft:gohu:pixelsize=14 then
2014-01-11 07:10:46	Ankh	with a 150dpi screen I can't imagine wanting it, but I need reading glasses these days :)
2014-01-11 07:10:53	Ankh	and I'd have needed them sooner if I'd used that font!
2014-01-11 07:11:58	Ankh	anyway, if they are in ~/.fonts and show up with fc-list, treat it as an xft font, not an X font
2014-01-11 07:12:36	contempt	what do you mean? What is the difference?
2014-01-11 07:12:48	contempt	from xft and X fonts
2014-01-11 07:13:15	Ankh	xft fonts are client-side, not in the server, and are a newer technology, only 10 years old :)
2014-01-11 07:13:25	Ankh	and they are the normal fonts used on Linux these days
2014-01-11 07:13:39	Ankh	(xft is the name of the library, not a font format)
2014-01-11 07:14:04	contempt	also, having URxvt*font: -gohu-gohufont-medium-* in the .Xdefaults makes urxvt to use it, so all cli applications will use it? irssi, mutt etc. etc?
2014-01-11 07:14:20	contempt	but not for example firefox
2014-01-11 07:14:53	contempt	the unique application to instruct is the terminal emulator?
2014-01-11 07:14:57	Ankh	no
2014-01-11 07:15:09	Ankh	wan't make anything use it
2014-01-11 07:15:15	Ankh	that's an X Server-side font name
2014-01-11 07:15:48	contempt	you mean in tty it won't work
2014-01-11 07:15:54	Ankh	I didn't say that
2014-01-11 07:15:58	Ankh	xlsfonts | grep gohu
2014-01-11 07:16:16	Ankh	if that works, then  that XDefault may work for a few very very old programs
2014-01-11 07:16:34	Ankh	although the URxvt there means it will only affect programs called URxvt
2014-01-11 07:16:42	Ankh	so not, for example, a Web browser
2014-01-11 07:16:59	contempt	http://sprunge.us/DCUg

2014-01-11 07:30:21	Ankh	http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/fonts/xlfd.html but you have probably moved past it already

2014-01-13 08:02:38	Ankh	obiwahn, where are we looking in the screenshot?
2014-01-13 08:03:00	Ankh	I don't see a greek sigma there
2014-01-13 08:13:08	diogenese	It's to the right of [unix] at the bottom.
2014-01-13 08:14:12	-->	pingu2 (~pingussd@unaffiliated/mircirc-user747/x-9502868) has joined ##fonts
2014-01-13 08:15:36	diogenese	Might have something to do with adding the glyph to a monospaced font with a different advance, leaving a gap to the right.
2014-01-13 08:16:17	Ankh	still doesn't look much like a sigma :)
2014-01-13 08:16:37	diogenese	It's an arrow
2014-01-13 08:16:45	Ankh	aha
2014-01-13 08:17:59	Ankh	sort of like ◀
2014-01-13 08:18:08	diogenese	Yes
2014-01-13 08:18:42	Ankh	if at all possible you should either redraw something like that left-pointing triangle (25C0) or use the private use area
2014-01-13 08:19:11	Ankh	but yes, i'd probably use fontforge
2014-01-13 08:19:45	Ankh	it's not as complicated as it seems for simple things. Copy and paste an existing glyph from the font if needed, and modify it by double-clicking on it to get to the glyh window
2014-01-13 08:19:59	Ankh	or, fix the metrics of your glyph :)
2014-01-13 08:20:42	diogenese	Yes, was very tired when obiwahn asked, so didn't respond.
2014-01-13 08:20:55	Ankh	oh, oops
2014-01-13 08:21:04	Ankh	I didn't even notice it was someone else I was talking to! sorry
2014-01-13 08:21:17	diogenese	It's ok.
2014-01-13 08:21:32	Ankh	(I hope I am not standing in the sun and making you cold)
2014-01-13 08:22:36	pingu2	hi
2014-01-13 08:23:08	Ankh	hi pingu2
2014-01-13 08:25:43	diogenese	obiwahn's still in the channel, probably asleep now. Maybe he'll see this when he comes back on.
2014-01-13 08:26:05	pingu2	what was the question?  i missed half the conv
2014-01-13 08:27:00	diogenese	He patched a monospaced font with some extra glyphs and there was a ugly gap to the right of one of them.
2014-01-13 08:27:48	pingu2	i've been meaning to add a monospace option to this fontcombiner thing
2014-01-13 08:29:30	pingu2	i've been too tied up for months to implement anything new.  it's still growing though, slowly slowly.  want to see? http://fontcombiner.com/create 834 social shares
2014-01-13 08:29:41	Ankh	being tied up isn't always bad :-)
2014-01-13 08:29:58	diogenese	I was curios about the effect of grabbing opentype glyphs and adding them to a truetype font. The metrics are way different. Units per em especially.
2014-01-13 08:31:59	pingu2	i completely forget how that thing works at the moment
2014-01-13 08:34:18	pingu2	here's an extracted svg though for general interest http://webgel.net/bf/jsMath-cmr10_198.svg
2014-01-13 08:35:09	pingu2	i think i was looking at/planning some sort of system to convert path coordinates to integers.  i forget why
2014-01-13 08:36:07	pingu2	perhaps to remedy any floating point/decimal precision problems
2014-01-13 08:42:53	diogenese	I can see that being a problem. If converting between opentype to/from truetype, 1000 units/em to/from 2048 units/em, how to keep all the points as integers? There's a math problem for you. :)
2014-01-13 08:42:54	Ankh	may also depend on whether the glyphs are in truetype format or postscript type 1 format inside the opentype font
2014-01-13 08:43:30	Ankh	yeah, you have to make sure you keep verticals and horizontals vertical and horizontal
2014-01-13 08:44:26	diogenese	Ankh: BTW, looked over your web site. Impressive resumé.
2014-01-13 08:49:34	pingu2	what's the usual technique for establishing proportional character separation?  is there any sort of standard?
2014-01-13 08:55:05	Ankh	eek
2014-01-13 08:55:10	Ankh	i should update it :)
2014-01-13 08:55:41	diogenese	Sorry, couldn't help.
2014-01-13 08:56:47	diogenese	I've been ill for the last week and not able to work on anything hard, but can still surf.
2014-01-13 08:57:33	pingu2	i expect you would all shame me with your resumes.  i have no qualifications in anything at all
2014-01-13 08:58:35	diogenese	pingu2: From what I've seen, you've done well. I'd hire you.
2014-01-13 08:58:51	pingu2	thanks
2014-01-13 08:59:13	diogenese	Self motivation is a big plus.
2014-01-13 09:00:03	Ankh	no need to be sorry re. couldn't help, stay well!
2014-01-13 09:00:16	Ankh	pingu2, but are you wearing shoes and socks? :)
2014-01-13 09:00:17	pingu2	yep, it's all sort of just fun puzzles for me, the font stuff.  no reason for it really other than the challenge.  one more jsfiddle taken too far
2014-01-13 09:00:32	pingu2	Ankh: yep, just about
2014-01-13 09:00:49	Ankh	that's not so good then, I only hire people who aren't wearing shoes :)
2014-01-13 09:01:11	diogenese	Notice that. You like barefoot ;)
2014-01-13 09:01:18	Ankh	:)
2014-01-13 09:03:02	pingu2	i'm an accountant, actually (unqualified).  there's probably easier money in that than in web code
2014-01-13 09:03:35	Ankh	hard to know
2014-01-13 09:03:44	Ankh	if you're in Canada i need a new accountant :-)
2014-01-13 09:03:47	diogenese	My major fallback was always tending bar. Easy and good pay.
2014-01-13 09:04:17	pingu2	there is a lot to accounts
2014-01-13 09:04:40	Ankh	yes, there is
2014-01-13 09:04:42	diogenese	Yes and always a need for good accountants.
2014-01-13 09:04:51	pingu2	imagine though that a lot of the work involved in accounts preparation amounts to filtering through data
2014-01-13 09:04:56	diogenese	My mother was a bookkeeper.
2014-01-13 09:04:57	Ankh	tending bar is hard to do barefoot though, wouldn't work for me :)
2014-01-13 09:05:13	diogenese	Yeah, broken glass to deal with.
2014-01-13 09:05:32	pingu2	i do an accounts job each month <secret>i made script/robot to do it for me</script>
2014-01-13 09:05:42	pingu2	*</secret>
2014-01-13 09:06:16	pingu2	it's almost cheating
2014-01-13 09:07:56	diogenese	I used to inventory 3 bars every Sunday. Entire liquor stock and every bottle. Had a laptop and lotus 123 w/ weight scale. Went fast. Nothing wrong with automation.
2014-01-13 09:08:23	pingu2	modern technology
2014-01-13 09:11:14	pingu2	it's an odd quirk in modern society, i think.  we have all these gadgets and automation, but for some reason, just to maintain an equivalent lifestyle to people in similar positions in society, working class, the majority of us still work 7 or 8 hours every day, the same way we would have fifty years ago
2014-01-13 09:12:40	pingu2	seems like a bit of an anomaly to me.  something not quite right
2014-01-13 09:12:52	diogenese	Ever get that feeling you're on a hamster wheel?
2014-01-13 09:12:59	pingu2	sometimes
2014-01-13 09:17:09	Ankh	different cultures have moved the productivity gains to different places
2014-01-13 09:17:15	Ankh	e.g. in France people get longer holidays
2014-01-13 09:17:25	Ankh	in the USA the slave overseers get longer whips.
2014-01-13 09:17:26	diogenese	With pay?
2014-01-13 09:17:31	Ankh	yes, with pay
2014-01-13 09:17:34	diogenese	Nice
2014-01-13 09:18:05	Ankh	in some countries basic week is as high as 40 hrs or more, not 35
2014-01-13 09:19:35	diogenese	Here, in this town, the justice system supplies a slave labour force. The court is run assembly line and no breaks for the poor.
2014-01-13 09:19:51	Ankh	eek
2014-01-13 09:20:23	pingu2	40 hrs and more, i guess, in some.  i often feel guilty taking a warm shower, tbh, living in england, considering the couple of billion people in the world struggling to stay alive for lack of food and water
2014-01-13 09:21:26	Ankh	your shower won't affect tem directly of course, except that you and i can have hot running water and most of the world can't
2014-01-13 09:21:47	Ankh	(although i hear there has also been too much running cold water in England this winter!)
2014-01-13 09:22:14	pingu2	this is an interesting series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughest_Place_to_be_a... quite sobering
2014-01-13 09:22:57	pingu2	lots of flood warnings in the south here, yep
2014-01-13 09:23:02	Ankh	"Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name."
2014-01-13 09:23:23	pingu2	oh.  the link works for me
2014-01-13 09:23:34	 *	Ankh moved to canada from warrington, and before that from coventry, and before that from rural bedfordshire :)
2014-01-13 09:23:46	pingu2	ah
2014-01-13 09:23:55	Ankh	ah, wrong number of dots at the end, works now
2014-01-13 09:24:00	diogenese	This should work: http://bit.ly/1iEaugR
2014-01-13 09:24:08	diogenese	Too late
2014-01-13 09:25:26	pingu2	the ferryman one stuck with me
2014-01-13 09:25:35	pingu2	3.2
2014-01-13 09:25:57	pingu2	oh, and 4.2.  there may be youtubes
2014-01-13 09:32:23	diogenese	I had many friends in Maine that were fishermen. The sea claimed them all before I left.
2014-01-13 09:32:36	Ankh	:(
2014-01-13 09:33:02	diogenese	Hard job. Dangerous too.
2014-01-13 09:33:54	diogenese	I guess that's why all the houses facing the ocean have widow walks.
2014-01-13 09:34:54	Ankh	yeah. although for injuries it turns out farming can be pretty bad too
2014-01-13 09:36:15	diogenese	Yes. Heard of a guy that got scalped by a combine.
2014-01-13 09:36:33	pingu2	another interesting series.  not to imply that i spend all my time watching documentaries or anything.  i don't know if blocked outside of UK.  shipwrecks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W460xyYr_QQ and a 'toughest place' episode http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuON10hT-L0 - the ferry one
2014-01-13 09:39:45	diogenese	It's not blocked here in California.
2014-01-13 09:39:46	 *	Ankh can't watch now, but I live near a region with a large number of shipwrecks
2014-01-13 09:39:48	Ankh	on lake ontario
2014-01-13 09:40:18	Ankh	there are mineral deposits, it seems - ship's compasses go astray - and there's a limestone shelf going out at least a quarter of a mile beyond the island
2014-01-13 09:40:32	Ankh	and strong winds and strong currents, at least by great lakes standards
2014-01-13 09:44:56	diogenese	That lake's claimed it's share: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_in_the_Great_Lakes#Lake_Ontario
2014-01-13 09:45:31	Ankh	yeah
2014-01-13 09:46:09	 *	Ankh is near amherst island and duck island
2014-01-13 09:46:28	Ankh	(same island that has Picton on it, some would call it a pininsula)

2014-01-13 11:34:23	Ankh	pingu2, proportional character separation - sidebearings should be made to work by the font designer even when no kerning is used; look at a word like “minimum” for evenness of spacing. perhaps slightly more between m and i (etc) than between the verticals in m, and with curves closer (oo closest then ob then db) same as with basic calligraphy
2014-01-13 11:37:01	pingu2	Ankh: do you have javascript enabled in your browser?
2014-01-13 11:39:20	pingu2	i meant to ask more on the mathematical approach to auto spacing, really.  i have a feeling it might be a bit of a secret science.  info is hard to find
2014-01-13 11:40:27	pingu2	i have an algorithm ready to go that uses polynomials http://fontcombiner.com/docs/characterspacing
2014-01-13 11:43:56	pingu2	it seems to work almost out of the tin (ie without any extra detection of serifs)  i've looked at some font forge source to see what that uses, but i find it hard to follow.  i don't know if i'm on to anything new with the approach
2014-01-13 11:44:21	pingu2	(js required to view the graphs/plots)
2014-01-13 11:53:51	Ankh	i do have js
2014-01-13 11:54:09	Ankh	a lot of it (but not all) is about equalizing total area between letters
2014-01-13 11:54:31	Ankh	hermann zapf had an auto letter spacing program developed at one point and I think peter karow did too
2014-01-13 11:54:39	Ankh	both were highly propretary
2014-01-13 11:54:43	Ankh	proprietary
2014-01-13 11:55:33	pingu2	yep, i searched around quite a lot for something open.  i didn't find much
2014-01-13 11:55:42	Ankh	some systems in the past have used "sector kerning" in which you make an approximation to character shape, u.g. using between 3 and 6 pixels on a side
2014-01-13 11:56:15	Ankh	that way you can deal with "T." without an explicit kern pair, but it's not a perfect system by any means
2014-01-13 11:57:42	pingu2	font forge has a built-in hook for its measurements.  i think it takes about 100 up and down the vertical between every pair
2014-01-13 11:57:44	 *	Ankh reading about kernagic... yes, stem rhythm is an important part of it
2014-01-13 11:58:27	pingu2	the maths is a bit beyond me, starting with a wikipedia page, moving to maths is fun youtubes : )
2014-01-13 11:59:26	pingu2	i have some nice sums i've adapted from javascript, which i guess is always open
2014-01-13 12:00:12	Ankh	heh fun youtubes
2014-01-13 12:00:37	pingu2	i think the major difficulty is serifs
2014-01-13 12:00:51	diogenese	I've had much trouble with small point sizes where there's only 1 or 2 pixels between glyphs. Not all glyphs tend to snap to the next pixel at the same time. Same with the spacing between them. So many variables to deal with.
2014-01-13 12:00:53	Ankh	you also have to take stem weight into account

2014-01-13 12:09:03	diogenese	Web fonts with calculated sizes, like 8.72px, really bring out the bad some fonts. Got to watch the letters in the status bar dance around as numbers changed.
2014-01-13 12:09:32	diogenese	*bad in some fonts.
2014-01-13 12:10:13	pingu2	just browsing some of my source, starting to remember.  it looks like i was on the track of presenting a user option for auto spacing that skips fewer or more separation measurements effectively giving control over shape detection precision
2014-01-13 12:10:47	pingu2	so i guess the idea is to try to offer a sort of middle ground between auto and manual
2014-01-13 12:15:01	pingu2	sketchy territory really.  i always feel like i'm cheating a bit and that it could be an insult to the proprietary tech out there or people making careers out of developing it
2014-01-13 12:15:51	pingu2	hopefully i'm treading on too many toes

2014-01-13 12:29:34	diogenese	Computer fonts are their own world. I paid for college working nights at the local paper as a typographer. No grid fitting involved. I did know how many points in a pica, picas in an inch.
2014-01-13 12:38:31	pingu2	i imagine that there's almost a 'can't win, don't try' aspect to traditional typography given the limits of the display hardware.  maybe that's about to change.  like Ankh said, 72 ppi vs 600.  we've been stuck at 72 for i guess 20 years. everything is about to change with all the high density mobiles, 'retina' display, all that sort of thing
2014-01-13 12:38:57	pingu2	there could be more demand for really good fonts before long
2014-01-13 12:39:21	diogenese	I believe so. Keeps getting better.
2014-01-13 12:43:56	diogenese	It through me for a loop when points and pixels started to differ. I was so used to 72 points in an inch and using points and pixels interchangeably.
2014-01-13 13:02:28	Ankh	pingu2, well, my laptop screen here (HP) is 146dpi and this monitor is I think 100
2014-01-13 13:06:44	diogenese	Higher resolutions started showing up some time ago. Maybe 15 years or so?
2014-01-13 13:07:01	Ankh	well, off and on, all along, but getting more common
2014-01-13 13:07:10	Ankh	I had access to a 300dpi display (in theory) in 1986

2014-01-13 13:16:32	pingu2	i think it might stem the original svga or something

2014-01-13 13:19:25	pingu2	96 is more common
2014-01-13 13:19:27	diogenese	Big screen TVs had some really low ppi, like 21 :)
2014-01-13 13:22:44	diogenese	The higher the resolution gets, the less grid fitting is going to be an issue. I like that.

2014-01-13 13:57:31	Ankh	the people who consider it insane are clearly insane :) but what does almost barefoot mean?
2014-01-13 13:58:27	diogenese	I don't think it's possible barefoot. At least it hasn't been done afaik.

2014-01-13 13:58:46	Ankh	oh, in tevas, missed that

2014-01-13 13:59:50	diogenese	If you're not trying to break records, I'm sure it could be done.
2014-01-13 14:00:17	pingu2	i guess you'd adapt after a while.  i was watching an interesting thing about shaolin monks recently.  they condition themselves to the extent that you could hit them over the head a mallet and it'd bounce right off
2014-01-13 14:00:19	Ankh	probably. "received wisdom" often isn't all that wise or universal

2014-01-13 14:01:14	Ankh	e.g. when trying to develop a jumping shoe, reebok commissioned a study comparing various shoes for the high-jump, and the study actually found the control group (bare feet) did best

2014-01-13 14:14:54	diogenese	Apparently, quite a few have done the Appalachian trial barefoot. It's an easier trail, but still amazing: http://appalachiantrail.com/books/barefoot-sisters

2014-01-13 15:13:42	obiwahn	i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-13 15:13:54	obiwahn	it is a symbol in the private use area

2014-01-13 15:14:28	obiwahn	i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-13 15:14:44	diogenese	You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-13 15:15:00	obiwahn	it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-13 15:15:37	diogenese	It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-13 15:17:30	diogenese	Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-13 15:18:03	diogenese	*of the right bearing.

2014-01-13 17:00:59	obiwahn	would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-13 17:02:31	diogenese	I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-13 17:03:07	diogenese	Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-13 17:04:18	obiwahn	i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-13 17:04:40	diogenese	It's extensive.
2014-01-13 17:05:03	obiwahn	i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-13 17:05:28	obiwahn	setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-13 17:05:34	diogenese	You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-13 17:05:36	obiwahn	from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-13 17:06:13	obiwahn	diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-13 17:06:16	diogenese	If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-13 17:08:08	obiwahn	mh
2014-01-13 17:08:19	obiwahn	where do i read the advance?
2014-01-13 17:08:36	obiwahn	it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-13 17:08:37	diogenese	You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-13 17:10:06	obiwahn	http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-13 17:10:07	diogenese	The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-13 17:10:13	obiwahn	i see the bule stuff
2014-01-13 17:10:31	obiwahn	but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-13 17:10:55	obiwahn	blue
2014-01-13 17:12:02	obiwahn	the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-13 17:12:21	diogenese	For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-13 17:12:27	obiwahn	yes
2014-01-13 17:12:34	obiwahn	and for this one as well
2014-01-13 17:13:33	diogenese	Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-13 17:13:39	obiwahn	how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-13 17:14:47	obiwahn	just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-13 17:15:05	diogenese	The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-13 17:15:51	obiwahn	mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-13 17:16:25	obiwahn	i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-13 17:17:10	diogenese	The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-13 17:18:22	diogenese	What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-13 17:19:46	obiwahn	http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-13 17:20:02	obiwahn	i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-13 17:20:30	obiwahn	i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-13 17:20:38	obiwahn	so i expected this file to change
2014-01-13 17:21:09	diogenese	I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-13 17:24:56	diogenese	Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-13 17:26:14	diogenese	You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-13 17:26:41	obiwahn	i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-13 17:27:20	obiwahn	https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-13 17:27:26	diogenese	Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-13 17:27:36	obiwahn	that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-13 17:27:42	diogenese	Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-13 17:28:18	diogenese	I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-13 17:28:53	diogenese	If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-13 17:36:09	obiwahn	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-13 17:36:16	obiwahn	that is the font
2014-01-13 17:36:34	obiwahn	i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-13 17:37:13	obiwahn	did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-13 17:37:49	diogenese	Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.

2014-01-13 17:43:34	diogenese	Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-13 17:43:49	obiwahn	ok
2014-01-13 17:44:34	diogenese	So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-13 17:44:53	obiwahn	i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-13 17:44:55	obiwahn	ok
2014-01-13 17:45:52	diogenese	You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1

2014-01-13 17:48:06	diogenese	Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-13 17:48:39	diogenese	I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-13 17:49:00	obiwahn	a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-13 17:49:11	diogenese	It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-13 17:49:41	diogenese	That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.

2014-01-13 18:05:56	diogenese	You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.

2014-01-13 18:07:59	obiwahn	it seems a bit too much
2014-01-13 18:08:10	obiwahn	but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-13 18:08:24	diogenese	I was close :)
2014-01-13 18:08:52	diogenese	It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-13 18:09:07	obiwahn	it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-13 18:09:25	<--	paragan (paragan@unaffiliated/paragan) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-01-13 18:09:58	obiwahn	but far better than before:)
2014-01-13 18:10:03	diogenese	You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-13 18:10:16	diogenese	You can move those points :)
2014-01-13 18:11:45	diogenese	You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-13 18:12:56	diogenese	You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-13 18:16:35	diogenese	The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-13 18:17:37	obiwahn	i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-13 18:18:23	diogenese	The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-13 18:19:28	obiwahn	so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-13 18:19:35	obiwahn	= advance
2014-01-13 18:20:29	diogenese	The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-13 18:24:03	diogenese	Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-13 18:27:00	diogenese	A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-13 18:28:52	obiwahn	:) no not at all
2014-01-13 18:29:05	obiwahn	i had phsyics as second
2014-01-13 18:29:22	diogenese	You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-13 18:30:12	<--	pravins (psatpute@nat/redhat/x-qcgnmxjqwjvvthdh) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-01-13 18:31:24	diogenese	another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-13 18:38:30	obiwahn	oh nice
2014-01-13 18:39:02	obiwahn	ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-13 18:39:18	obiwahn	ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-13 18:39:21	diogenese	It gets easier :)
2014-01-13 18:39:41	obiwahn	but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-13 18:39:56	diogenese	Good luck.

2014-01-14 05:44:36	obiwahn	diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-14 05:44:53	diogenese	Yes
2014-01-14 05:45:45	obiwahn	there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-14 05:46:07	obiwahn	but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-14 05:47:52	diogenese	First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-14 05:48:13	diogenese	For powerline that is.
2014-01-14 05:49:13	diogenese	If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-14 05:50:49	obiwahn	how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-14 05:53:29	obiwahn	Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-14 05:54:08	obiwahn	diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-14 05:55:00	diogenese	I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-14 05:55:09	obiwahn	and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-14 05:55:26	diogenese	Not sure.
2014-01-14 05:55:42	obiwahn	do you create glyphs?
2014-01-14 05:56:06	diogenese	Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-14 05:56:15	diogenese	one
2014-01-14 05:56:29	obiwahn	is your work font related?
2014-01-14 05:56:33	diogenese	It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-14 05:56:42	diogenese	No, not any more.
2014-01-14 05:57:37	obiwahn	Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-14 05:58:30	diogenese	I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-14 05:59:22	diogenese	The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-14 06:00:15	obiwahn	Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-14 06:00:27	diogenese	I'm getting up there.
2014-01-14 06:00:48	Ankh	does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-14 06:01:20	diogenese	I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-14 06:01:20	obiwahn	i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-14 06:02:05	diogenese	We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-14 06:02:32	diogenese	I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking
2014-01-14 06:03:15	diogenese	Colourful history: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographical_Union
2014-01-14 06:03:46	obiwahn	i am a programmer creating software for cnc machines and 30% sysadmin:)
2014-01-14 06:04:06	Ankh	what are cnc machines in this context?
2014-01-14 06:08:10	obiwahn	CNC ~ Computerized Numerical Control

2014-01-14 06:10:45	diogenese	And a time traveler too :)
2014-01-14 06:13:44	obiwahn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-14 06:13:58	diogenese	It is
2014-01-14 06:14:18	obiwahn	but pretty hard names
2014-01-14 06:14:52	Ankh	none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-14 06:14:59	Ankh	I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-14 06:16:37	diogenese	We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-14 06:17:11	diogenese	Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-14 06:17:17	obiwahn	uhm - why?
2014-01-14 06:18:00	diogenese	For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-14 06:18:04	obiwahn	lah ok
2014-01-14 06:18:20	obiwahn	i was misinterpreting what you wrote

2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:03:48] ok, and, if you're using gnome. Character Map (gucharmap) can show you if it's used for particular characters/codepoints
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:04:09] no, I'm using ratpoison
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:04:22] well, well, ratpoison is a window manager
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:04:43] yes, no desktop environment
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:04:46] and gnome is a desktop environment; gnome 2 can use a lot of different window managers.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:05:04] anyway, ok, try gucharmap maybe (if it's installed)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:05:58] is this gohufont a truetype font?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:07:19] Ankh: how can I check? the description says it's a bitmap font
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:07:39] try, urxvt -fn xft:gohu:pixelsize=15
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:07:48] where gohu is the name as it appears in your grep command
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:08:05] what's the exact filename?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:08:31] wow, I see it, it's tiny
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:08:53] which format did you download?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:08:58] pcf?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:09:04] yes pcf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:09:58] http://sprunge.us/DMDV
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:10:15] yeah, ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:10:23] I've followed this http://keilhau.org/customizing-linux.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:10:27] urxvt -fn xft:gohu:pixelsize=14 then
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:10:46] with a 150dpi screen I can't imagine wanting it, but I need reading glasses these days :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:10:53] and I'd have needed them sooner if I'd used that font!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:11:58] anyway, if they are in ~/.fonts and show up with fc-list, treat it as an xft font, not an X font
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:12:36] what do you mean? What is the difference?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:12:48] from xft and X fonts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:13:15] xft fonts are client-side, not in the server, and are a newer technology, only 10 years old :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:13:25] and they are the normal fonts used on Linux these days
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:13:39] (xft is the name of the library, not a font format)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:14:04] also, having URxvt*font: -gohu-gohufont-medium-* in the .Xdefaults makes urxvt to use it, so all cli applications will use it? irssi, mutt etc. etc?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:14:20] but not for example firefox
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:14:53] the unique application to instruct is the terminal emulator?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:14:57] no
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:15:09] wan't make anything use it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:15:15] that's an X Server-side font name
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:15:48] you mean in tty it won't work
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:15:54] I didn't say that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:15:58] xlsfonts | grep gohu
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:16:16] if that works, then  that XDefault may work for a few very very old programs
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:16:34] although the URxvt there means it will only affect programs called URxvt
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:16:42] so not, for example, a Web browser
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:16:59] http://sprunge.us/DCUg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:17:53] ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:18:12] so, urxvf -fn gohu-gohufont-bold-r-normal--14-100-100-100-c-80-iso8859-1
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:18:13] may work
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:18:19] I needed to add in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:18:31] er urxvt I mean
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:18:38] the font path
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:18:43] in the Files section
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:19:48] https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=89049&p=2 may help
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:21:23] Ankh: http://i.imgur.com/QOTxzJl.png
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:21:39] ow :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:21:54] BitchX?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	contempt	[07:22:11] irssi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:22:15] ah ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [07:28:54] used to have a Web page about configuring these old-style X fonts somewhere
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[07:30:21] http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/fonts/xlfd.html but you have probably moved past it already
2014-01-17 10:23:17	edakiri	[19:04:47] I would like to use the SPArc console font in graphical applications, like a terminal emulator. The SPArc font is in Linux, but coded an array of values.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	edakiri	[19:05:26] How can I find a source which I can otherwise use, such as OpenTypeFormat?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	edakiri	[19:06:34] I like FONT_SUN12x22 .
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pabs3	[20:04:03] anyone in Vancouver? http://www.typecamp.org/camps/web-type-west/
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:01:29] pabs3, not in Vancouver I, I'm 5 to 7 hours' flight away (quicker to get to Paris from here) but John Hudson does awesome work, looks like a good event
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:52:30] hi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:54:24] i have been following this guide here
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:54:26] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html#font-patching
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:55:22] now when i am in vim the symbol U+E0B2 is not aligned like i would expect it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:55:42] there is always some background on the right edge
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:56:37] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d266c10c65c2.98360772.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:56:52] i have tried fontforge but is seems very complex
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:57:32] i would be glad if you could help me to align the U+E0B2 to the right so the ugly gap goes away
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:02:38] obiwahn, where are we looking in the screenshot?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:03:00] I don't see a greek sigma there
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:13:08] It's to the right of [unix] at the bottom.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:15:36] Might have something to do with adding the glyph to a monospaced font with a different advance, leaving a gap to the right.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:16:17] still doesn't look much like a sigma :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:16:37] It's an arrow
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:16:45] aha
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:17:59] sort of like ◀
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:18:08] Yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:18:42] if at all possible you should either redraw something like that left-pointing triangle (25C0) or use the private use area
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:19:11] but yes, i'd probably use fontforge
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:19:45] it's not as complicated as it seems for simple things. Copy and paste an existing glyph from the font if needed, and modify it by double-clicking on it to get to the glyh window
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:19:59] or, fix the metrics of your glyph :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:20:42] Yes, was very tired when obiwahn asked, so didn't respond.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:20:55] oh, oops
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:21:04] I didn't even notice it was someone else I was talking to! sorry
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:21:17] It's ok.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:21:32] (I hope I am not standing in the sun and making you cold)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:22:36] hi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:23:08] hi pingu2
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:25:43] obiwahn's still in the channel, probably asleep now. Maybe he'll see this when he comes back on.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:26:05] what was the question?  i missed half the conv
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:27:00] He patched a monospaced font with some extra glyphs and there was a ugly gap to the right of one of them.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:27:48] i've been meaning to add a monospace option to this fontcombiner thing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:29:30] i've been too tied up for months to implement anything new.  it's still growing though, slowly slowly.  want to see? http://fontcombiner.com/create 834 social shares
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:29:41] being tied up isn't always bad :-)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:29:58] I was curios about the effect of grabbing opentype glyphs and adding them to a truetype font. The metrics are way different. Units per em especially.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:31:59] i completely forget how that thing works at the moment
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:34:18] here's an extracted svg though for general interest http://webgel.net/bf/jsMath-cmr10_198.svg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:35:09] i think i was looking at/planning some sort of system to convert path coordinates to integers.  i forget why
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:36:07] perhaps to remedy any floating point/decimal precision problems
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:42:53] I can see that being a problem. If converting between opentype to/from truetype, 1000 units/em to/from 2048 units/em, how to keep all the points as integers? There's a math problem for you. :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:42:54] may also depend on whether the glyphs are in truetype format or postscript type 1 format inside the opentype font
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:43:30] yeah, you have to make sure you keep verticals and horizontals vertical and horizontal
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:44:26] Ankh: BTW, looked over your web site. Impressive resumé.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:49:34] what's the usual technique for establishing proportional character separation?  is there any sort of standard?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:55:05] eek
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[08:55:10] i should update it :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:55:41] Sorry, couldn't help.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:56:47] I've been ill for the last week and not able to work on anything hard, but can still surf.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:57:33] i expect you would all shame me with your resumes.  i have no qualifications in anything at all
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:58:35] pingu2: From what I've seen, you've done well. I'd hire you.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[08:58:51] thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[08:59:13] Self motivation is a big plus.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:00:03] no need to be sorry re. couldn't help, stay well!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:00:16] pingu2, but are you wearing shoes and socks? :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:00:17] yep, it's all sort of just fun puzzles for me, the font stuff.  no reason for it really other than the challenge.  one more jsfiddle taken too far
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:00:32] Ankh: yep, just about
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:00:49] that's not so good then, I only hire people who aren't wearing shoes :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:01:11] Notice that. You like barefoot ;)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:01:18] :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:03:02] i'm an accountant, actually (unqualified).  there's probably easier money in that than in web code
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:03:35] hard to know
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:03:44] if you're in Canada i need a new accountant :-)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:03:47] My major fallback was always tending bar. Easy and good pay.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:04:17] there is a lot to accounts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:04:40] yes, there is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:04:42] Yes and always a need for good accountants.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:04:51] imagine though that a lot of the work involved in accounts preparation amounts to filtering through data
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:04:56] My mother was a bookkeeper.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:04:57] tending bar is hard to do barefoot though, wouldn't work for me :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:05:13] Yeah, broken glass to deal with.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:05:32] i do an accounts job each month <secret>i made script/robot to do it for me</script>
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:05:42] *</secret>
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:06:16] it's almost cheating
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:07:56] I used to inventory 3 bars every Sunday. Entire liquor stock and every bottle. Had a laptop and lotus 123 w/ weight scale. Went fast. Nothing wrong with automation.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:08:23] modern technology
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:11:14] it's an odd quirk in modern society, i think.  we have all these gadgets and automation, but for some reason, just to maintain an equivalent lifestyle to people in similar positions in society, working class, the majority of us still work 7 or 8 hours every day, the same way we would have fifty years ago
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:12:40] seems like a bit of an anomaly to me.  something not quite right
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:12:52] Ever get that feeling you're on a hamster wheel?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:12:59] sometimes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:17:09] different cultures have moved the productivity gains to different places
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:17:15] e.g. in France people get longer holidays
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:17:25] in the USA the slave overseers get longer whips.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:17:26] With pay?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:17:31] yes, with pay
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:17:34] Nice
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:18:05] in some countries basic week is as high as 40 hrs or more, not 35
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:19:35] Here, in this town, the justice system supplies a slave labour force. The court is run assembly line and no breaks for the poor.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:19:51] eek
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:20:23] 40 hrs and more, i guess, in some.  i often feel guilty taking a warm shower, tbh, living in england, considering the couple of billion people in the world struggling to stay alive for lack of food and water
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:21:26] your shower won't affect tem directly of course, except that you and i can have hot running water and most of the world can't
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:21:47] (although i hear there has also been too much running cold water in England this winter!)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:22:14] this is an interesting series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughest_Place_to_be_a... quite sobering
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:22:57] lots of flood warnings in the south here, yep
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:23:02] "Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name."
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:23:23] oh.  the link works for me
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [09:23:34] moved to canada from warrington, and before that from coventry, and before that from rural bedfordshire :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:23:46] ah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:23:55] ah, wrong number of dots at the end, works now
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:24:00] This should work: http://bit.ly/1iEaugR
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:24:08] Too late
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:25:26] the ferryman one stuck with me
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:25:35] 3.2
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:25:57] oh, and 4.2.  there may be youtubes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:32:23] I had many friends in Maine that were fishermen. The sea claimed them all before I left.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:32:36] :(
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:33:02] Hard job. Dangerous too.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:33:54] I guess that's why all the houses facing the ocean have widow walks.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:34:54] yeah. although for injuries it turns out farming can be pretty bad too
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:36:15] Yes. Heard of a guy that got scalped by a combine.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[09:36:33] another interesting series.  not to imply that i spend all my time watching documentaries or anything.  i don't know if blocked outside of UK.  shipwrecks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W460xyYr_QQ and a 'toughest place' episode http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuON10hT-L0 - the ferry one
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:39:45] It's not blocked here in California.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [09:39:46] can't watch now, but I live near a region with a large number of shipwrecks
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:39:48] on lake ontario
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:40:18] there are mineral deposits, it seems - ship's compasses go astray - and there's a limestone shelf going out at least a quarter of a mile beyond the island
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:40:32] and strong winds and strong currents, at least by great lakes standards
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[09:44:56] That lake's claimed it's share: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_in_the_Great_Lakes#Lake_Ontario
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:45:31] yeah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [09:46:09] is near amherst island and duck island
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:46:28] (same island that has Picton on it, some would call it a pininsula)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:46:35] er peninsula
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:47:03] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marysburgh_vortex used to say it was because of UFOs :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[09:50:59] and http://past.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile=The_mystery_behind_the_Marysburgh_Vortex_01_08_2012
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [09:51:02] off for a bit
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:34:23] pingu2, proportional character separation - sidebearings should be made to work by the font designer even when no kerning is used; look at a word like “minimum” for evenness of spacing. perhaps slightly more between m and i (etc) than between the verticals in m, and with curves closer (oo closest then ob then db) same as with basic calligraphy
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:37:01] Ankh: do you have javascript enabled in your browser?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:39:20] i meant to ask more on the mathematical approach to auto spacing, really.  i have a feeling it might be a bit of a secret science.  info is hard to find
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:40:27] i have an algorithm ready to go that uses polynomials http://fontcombiner.com/docs/characterspacing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:43:56] it seems to work almost out of the tin (ie without any extra detection of serifs)  i've looked at some font forge source to see what that uses, but i find it hard to follow.  i don't know if i'm on to anything new with the approach
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:44:21] (js required to view the graphs/plots)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:53:51] i do have js
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:54:09] a lot of it (but not all) is about equalizing total area between letters
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:54:31] hermann zapf had an auto letter spacing program developed at one point and I think peter karow did too
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:54:39] both were highly propretary
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:54:43] proprietary
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:55:33] yep, i searched around quite a lot for something open.  i didn't find much
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:55:42] some systems in the past have used "sector kerning" in which you make an approximation to character shape, u.g. using between 3 and 6 pixels on a side
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[11:56:15] that way you can deal with "T." without an explicit kern pair, but it's not a perfect system by any means
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:57:42] font forge has a built-in hook for its measurements.  i think it takes about 100 up and down the vertical between every pair
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [11:57:44] reading about kernagic... yes, stem rhythm is an important part of it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:58:27] the maths is a bit beyond me, starting with a wikipedia page, moving to maths is fun youtubes : )
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[11:59:26] i have some nice sums i've adapted from javascript, which i guess is always open
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[12:00:12] heh fun youtubes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:00:37] i think the major difficulty is serifs
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:00:51] I've had much trouble with small point sizes where there's only 1 or 2 pixels between glyphs. Not all glyphs tend to snap to the next pixel at the same time. Same with the spacing between them. So many variables to deal with.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[12:00:53] you also have to take stem weight into account
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[12:01:20] 1 or 2 px is OK at 72dpi, not ok at 600dpi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:09:03] Web fonts with calculated sizes, like 8.72px, really bring out the bad some fonts. Got to watch the letters in the status bar dance around as numbers changed.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:09:32] *bad in some fonts.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:10:13] just browsing some of my source, starting to remember.  it looks like i was on the track of presenting a user option for auto spacing that skips fewer or more separation measurements effectively giving control over shape detection precision
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:10:47] so i guess the idea is to try to offer a sort of middle ground between auto and manual
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:15:01] sketchy territory really.  i always feel like i'm cheating a bit and that it could be an insult to the proprietary tech out there or people making careers out of developing it
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:15:51] hopefully i'm treading on too many toes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:16:01] *not
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:16:11] :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:29:34] Computer fonts are their own world. I paid for college working nights at the local paper as a typographer. No grid fitting involved. I did know how many points in a pica, picas in an inch.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:38:31] i imagine that there's almost a 'can't win, don't try' aspect to traditional typography given the limits of the display hardware.  maybe that's about to change.  like Ankh said, 72 ppi vs 600.  we've been stuck at 72 for i guess 20 years. everything is about to change with all the high density mobiles, 'retina' display, all that sort of thing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[12:38:57] there could be more demand for really good fonts before long
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:39:21] I believe so. Keeps getting better.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[12:43:56] It through me for a loop when points and pixels started to differ. I was so used to 72 points in an inch and using points and pixels interchangeably.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:02:28] pingu2, well, my laptop screen here (HP) is 146dpi and this monitor is I think 100
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:06:44] Higher resolutions started showing up some time ago. Maybe 15 years or so?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:07:01] well, off and on, all along, but getting more common
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:07:10] I had access to a 300dpi display (in theory) in 1986
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:07:21] designed for newspaper usage - it was 19"
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:10:57] Makes sense. The first computer I sat in front of had a touch screen, in 1976. It was military. They can afford such things.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:13:01] i don't know what my main is.  standard 1080 25" i think
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:13:30] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:13:59] somewhere around 90?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:15:24] yep, 72 is an urban myth, really, isn't it.  i'm sure i knew that already.  comes up a lot making websites
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:16:04] Not a lot of 72ppi in that list, if any ;)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:16:32] i think it might stem the original svga or something
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:18:08] oh, no, orginal macintosh.  9", 72 ppi
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:19:25] 96 is more common
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:19:27] Big screen TVs had some really low ppi, like 21 :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:22:44] The higher the resolution gets, the less grid fitting is going to be an issue. I like that.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:25:38] diogenese, well, Web sites are made to 96dpi these days :P
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:25:58] over 600ppi font hinting becomes unimportant
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:27:19] at least in terms of grid fitting
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:35:14] Do browsers adjust the size for hi res screens? Like convert a 12px @ 96dpi to 75px @ 600dpi?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:35:45] yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:35:54] px are defined to be 96ths of an inch in CSS
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:35:55] Nice to know that.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:36:00] not device pixels
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:36:46] I've been doing it wrong.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:38:35] A problem I've run into. I focus on one thing for a long time and when I look around the world has changed.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:40:06] ah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:40:16] it's hat happens if you wear shoes too often :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:40:27] It's the shoes, yes.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:40:27] (or live in a barrel, perhaps?)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:40:38] It's a tub.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:40:43] :D
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:44:04] I almost never wore shoes when I lived in Micronesia. Flip-flops maybe, like to school.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [13:44:20] nods
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:45:53] They tried to enforce a dress code there, forcing everybody to wear shoes to school and my friend, David, showed up with the tops of sneakers, no bottoms.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:46:05] hah what happened?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:46:22] He was wearing shoes. What could they do?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:46:48] They didn't send him home and stopped enforcing that stupid rule.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:47:09] sounds good
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:49:02] I didn't notice my last GF had vanished for about 3 months : /
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:50:53] ??
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:53:32] looking around and the world has changed.  she sent me a breakup email, apparently.  we eventually caught up, and she told me she'd seen me since she sent it.  i think sometimes i get a bit distracted.  new years res to take a break and a look around occasionally
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:54:11] and wear shoes less often. Or get a boyfriend instead? :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:54:25] (or both)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[13:56:21] maybe.  i could swing both ways on paper.  i need women really, for the biologicals
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:56:37] ah :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:57:02] My last hike, followed a guy that was hiking the Pacific Crest Train in tevas. Almost barefoot. For long hikes that's considered insane. He was fast too. Never caught up to him.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:57:11] *trail
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:57:31] the people who consider it insane are clearly insane :) but what does almost barefoot mean?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:58:27] I don't think it's possible barefoot. At least it hasn't been done afaik.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:58:46] 5000km over rough terrain.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:58:46] oh, in tevas, missed that
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[13:59:14] yeah, i don't know, coast to coast has, both in US and Canada (although not in the winter in Canada in recorded history afaik!)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:59:30] Nice
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[13:59:50] If you're not trying to break records, I'm sure it could be done.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	pingu2	[14:00:17] i guess you'd adapt after a while.  i was watching an interesting thing about shaolin monks recently.  they condition themselves to the extent that you could hit them over the head a mallet and it'd bounce right off
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[14:00:19] probably. "received wisdom" often isn't all that wise or universal
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[14:00:31] boing!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[14:01:14] e.g. when trying to develop a jumping shoe, reebok commissioned a study comparing various shoes for the high-jump, and the study actually found the control group (bare feet) did best
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[14:01:31] to their credit they published it anyway, since theirs was the most effective of the shoes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[14:14:54] Apparently, quite a few have done the Appalachian trial barefoot. It's an easier trail, but still amazing: http://appalachiantrail.com/books/barefoot-sisters
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:13:34] diogenese: hey:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:13:42] i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-17 10:23:17	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now
2014-01-17 10:23:17	 *	Ankh [01:51:05] off again
2014-01-17 10:23:17	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[06:09:38] ok so i'm only six years old :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:10:45] And a time traveler too :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:18:20] i was misinterpreting what you wrote
2014-01-17 10:23:17	obiwahn	[06:21:21] good night! already 11:20 pm:(
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[06:24:40] Good night ;)

2014-01-17 10:23:17	behdad	[11:54:11] I've setup github.com/behdad/fonttools to send notices here.  Hope people don't mind.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[02:59:40] http://www.dafont.com/scriptina.font?text=10th+Annual
2014-01-17 10:23:17	Rickta59	[03:15:12] your awesome .. thanks
2014-01-17 10:23:17	diogenese	[03:15:32] Good luck ;)

2014-01-18 03:29:21	Ankh	sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-18 03:58:40	sgfgdf	Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-18 04:00:43	Ankh	yes
2014-01-18 04:01:00	Ankh	well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-18 04:03:47	sgfgdf	Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-18 04:05:47	Ankh	I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-18 04:06:13	Ankh	as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-18 04:19:58	sgfgdf	Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.

2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:54:26] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html#font-patching
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:55:22] now when i am in vim the symbol U+E0B2 is not aligned like i would expect it
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:55:42] there is always some background on the right edge
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:56:37] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d266c10c65c2.98360772.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:56:52] i have tried fontforge but is seems very complex
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:57:32] i would be glad if you could help me to align the U+E0B2 to the right so the ugly gap goes away
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:02:38] obiwahn, where are we looking in the screenshot?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:03:00] I don't see a greek sigma there
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:13:08] It's to the right of [unix] at the bottom.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:15:36] Might have something to do with adding the glyph to a monospaced font with a different advance, leaving a gap to the right.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:16:17] still doesn't look much like a sigma :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:16:37] It's an arrow
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:16:45] aha
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:17:59] sort of like ◀
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:18:08] Yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:18:42] if at all possible you should either redraw something like that left-pointing triangle (25C0) or use the private use area
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:19:11] but yes, i'd probably use fontforge
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:19:45] it's not as complicated as it seems for simple things. Copy and paste an existing glyph from the font if needed, and modify it by double-clicking on it to get to the glyh window
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:19:59] or, fix the metrics of your glyph :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:20:42] Yes, was very tired when obiwahn asked, so didn't respond.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:20:55] oh, oops
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:21:04] I didn't even notice it was someone else I was talking to! sorry
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:21:17] It's ok.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:21:32] (I hope I am not standing in the sun and making you cold)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:22:36] hi
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:23:08] hi pingu2
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:25:43] obiwahn's still in the channel, probably asleep now. Maybe he'll see this when he comes back on.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:26:05] what was the question?  i missed half the conv
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:27:00] He patched a monospaced font with some extra glyphs and there was a ugly gap to the right of one of them.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:27:48] i've been meaning to add a monospace option to this fontcombiner thing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:29:30] i've been too tied up for months to implement anything new.  it's still growing though, slowly slowly.  want to see? http://fontcombiner.com/create 834 social shares
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:29:41] being tied up isn't always bad :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:29:58] I was curios about the effect of grabbing opentype glyphs and adding them to a truetype font. The metrics are way different. Units per em especially.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:31:59] i completely forget how that thing works at the moment
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:34:18] here's an extracted svg though for general interest http://webgel.net/bf/jsMath-cmr10_198.svg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:35:09] i think i was looking at/planning some sort of system to convert path coordinates to integers.  i forget why
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:36:07] perhaps to remedy any floating point/decimal precision problems
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:42:53] I can see that being a problem. If converting between opentype to/from truetype, 1000 units/em to/from 2048 units/em, how to keep all the points as integers? There's a math problem for you. :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:42:54] may also depend on whether the glyphs are in truetype format or postscript type 1 format inside the opentype font
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:43:30] yeah, you have to make sure you keep verticals and horizontals vertical and horizontal
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:44:26] Ankh: BTW, looked over your web site. Impressive resumé.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:49:34] what's the usual technique for establishing proportional character separation?  is there any sort of standard?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:55:05] eek
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[08:55:10] i should update it :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:55:41] Sorry, couldn't help.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:56:47] I've been ill for the last week and not able to work on anything hard, but can still surf.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:57:33] i expect you would all shame me with your resumes.  i have no qualifications in anything at all
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:58:35] pingu2: From what I've seen, you've done well. I'd hire you.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[08:58:51] thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[08:59:13] Self motivation is a big plus.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:00:03] no need to be sorry re. couldn't help, stay well!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:00:16] pingu2, but are you wearing shoes and socks? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:00:17] yep, it's all sort of just fun puzzles for me, the font stuff.  no reason for it really other than the challenge.  one more jsfiddle taken too far
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:00:32] Ankh: yep, just about
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:00:49] that's not so good then, I only hire people who aren't wearing shoes :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:01:11] Notice that. You like barefoot ;)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:01:18] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:03:02] i'm an accountant, actually (unqualified).  there's probably easier money in that than in web code
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:03:35] hard to know
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:03:44] if you're in Canada i need a new accountant :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:03:47] My major fallback was always tending bar. Easy and good pay.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:04:17] there is a lot to accounts
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:04:40] yes, there is
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:04:42] Yes and always a need for good accountants.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:04:51] imagine though that a lot of the work involved in accounts preparation amounts to filtering through data
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:04:56] My mother was a bookkeeper.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:04:57] tending bar is hard to do barefoot though, wouldn't work for me :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:05:13] Yeah, broken glass to deal with.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:05:32] i do an accounts job each month <secret>i made script/robot to do it for me</script>
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:05:42] *</secret>
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:06:16] it's almost cheating
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:07:56] I used to inventory 3 bars every Sunday. Entire liquor stock and every bottle. Had a laptop and lotus 123 w/ weight scale. Went fast. Nothing wrong with automation.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:08:23] modern technology
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:11:14] it's an odd quirk in modern society, i think.  we have all these gadgets and automation, but for some reason, just to maintain an equivalent lifestyle to people in similar positions in society, working class, the majority of us still work 7 or 8 hours every day, the same way we would have fifty years ago
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:12:40] seems like a bit of an anomaly to me.  something not quite right
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:12:52] Ever get that feeling you're on a hamster wheel?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:12:59] sometimes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:17:09] different cultures have moved the productivity gains to different places
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:17:15] e.g. in France people get longer holidays
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:17:25] in the USA the slave overseers get longer whips.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:17:26] With pay?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:17:31] yes, with pay
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:17:34] Nice
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:18:05] in some countries basic week is as high as 40 hrs or more, not 35
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:19:35] Here, in this town, the justice system supplies a slave labour force. The court is run assembly line and no breaks for the poor.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:19:51] eek
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:20:23] 40 hrs and more, i guess, in some.  i often feel guilty taking a warm shower, tbh, living in england, considering the couple of billion people in the world struggling to stay alive for lack of food and water
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:21:26] your shower won't affect tem directly of course, except that you and i can have hot running water and most of the world can't
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:21:47] (although i hear there has also been too much running cold water in England this winter!)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:22:14] this is an interesting series http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughest_Place_to_be_a... quite sobering
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:22:57] lots of flood warnings in the south here, yep
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:23:02] "Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name."
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:23:23] oh.  the link works for me
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [09:23:34] moved to canada from warrington, and before that from coventry, and before that from rural bedfordshire :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:23:46] ah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:23:55] ah, wrong number of dots at the end, works now
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:24:00] This should work: http://bit.ly/1iEaugR
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:24:08] Too late
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:25:26] the ferryman one stuck with me
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:25:35] 3.2
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:25:57] oh, and 4.2.  there may be youtubes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:32:23] I had many friends in Maine that were fishermen. The sea claimed them all before I left.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:32:36] :(
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:33:02] Hard job. Dangerous too.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:33:54] I guess that's why all the houses facing the ocean have widow walks.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:34:54] yeah. although for injuries it turns out farming can be pretty bad too
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:36:15] Yes. Heard of a guy that got scalped by a combine.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[09:36:33] another interesting series.  not to imply that i spend all my time watching documentaries or anything.  i don't know if blocked outside of UK.  shipwrecks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W460xyYr_QQ and a 'toughest place' episode http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuON10hT-L0 - the ferry one
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:39:45] It's not blocked here in California.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [09:39:46] can't watch now, but I live near a region with a large number of shipwrecks
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:39:48] on lake ontario
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:40:18] there are mineral deposits, it seems - ship's compasses go astray - and there's a limestone shelf going out at least a quarter of a mile beyond the island
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:40:32] and strong winds and strong currents, at least by great lakes standards
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[09:44:56] That lake's claimed it's share: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_in_the_Great_Lakes#Lake_Ontario
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:45:31] yeah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [09:46:09] is near amherst island and duck island
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:46:28] (same island that has Picton on it, some would call it a pininsula)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:46:35] er peninsula
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:47:03] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marysburgh_vortex used to say it was because of UFOs :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[09:50:59] and http://past.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile=The_mystery_behind_the_Marysburgh_Vortex_01_08_2012
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [09:51:02] off for a bit
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:34:23] pingu2, proportional character separation - sidebearings should be made to work by the font designer even when no kerning is used; look at a word like “minimum” for evenness of spacing. perhaps slightly more between m and i (etc) than between the verticals in m, and with curves closer (oo closest then ob then db) same as with basic calligraphy
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:37:01] Ankh: do you have javascript enabled in your browser?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:39:20] i meant to ask more on the mathematical approach to auto spacing, really.  i have a feeling it might be a bit of a secret science.  info is hard to find
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:40:27] i have an algorithm ready to go that uses polynomials http://fontcombiner.com/docs/characterspacing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:43:56] it seems to work almost out of the tin (ie without any extra detection of serifs)  i've looked at some font forge source to see what that uses, but i find it hard to follow.  i don't know if i'm on to anything new with the approach
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:44:21] (js required to view the graphs/plots)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:53:51] i do have js
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:54:09] a lot of it (but not all) is about equalizing total area between letters
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:54:31] hermann zapf had an auto letter spacing program developed at one point and I think peter karow did too
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:54:39] both were highly propretary
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:54:43] proprietary
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:55:33] yep, i searched around quite a lot for something open.  i didn't find much
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:55:42] some systems in the past have used "sector kerning" in which you make an approximation to character shape, u.g. using between 3 and 6 pixels on a side
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:56:15] that way you can deal with "T." without an explicit kern pair, but it's not a perfect system by any means
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:57:42] font forge has a built-in hook for its measurements.  i think it takes about 100 up and down the vertical between every pair
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [11:57:44] reading about kernagic... yes, stem rhythm is an important part of it
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:58:27] the maths is a bit beyond me, starting with a wikipedia page, moving to maths is fun youtubes : )
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[11:59:26] i have some nice sums i've adapted from javascript, which i guess is always open
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[12:00:12] heh fun youtubes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:00:37] i think the major difficulty is serifs
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:00:51] I've had much trouble with small point sizes where there's only 1 or 2 pixels between glyphs. Not all glyphs tend to snap to the next pixel at the same time. Same with the spacing between them. So many variables to deal with.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[12:00:53] you also have to take stem weight into account
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[12:01:20] 1 or 2 px is OK at 72dpi, not ok at 600dpi
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:09:03] Web fonts with calculated sizes, like 8.72px, really bring out the bad some fonts. Got to watch the letters in the status bar dance around as numbers changed.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:09:32] *bad in some fonts.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:10:13] just browsing some of my source, starting to remember.  it looks like i was on the track of presenting a user option for auto spacing that skips fewer or more separation measurements effectively giving control over shape detection precision
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:10:47] so i guess the idea is to try to offer a sort of middle ground between auto and manual
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:15:01] sketchy territory really.  i always feel like i'm cheating a bit and that it could be an insult to the proprietary tech out there or people making careers out of developing it
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:15:51] hopefully i'm treading on too many toes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:16:01] *not
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:16:11] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:29:34] Computer fonts are their own world. I paid for college working nights at the local paper as a typographer. No grid fitting involved. I did know how many points in a pica, picas in an inch.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:38:31] i imagine that there's almost a 'can't win, don't try' aspect to traditional typography given the limits of the display hardware.  maybe that's about to change.  like Ankh said, 72 ppi vs 600.  we've been stuck at 72 for i guess 20 years. everything is about to change with all the high density mobiles, 'retina' display, all that sort of thing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[12:38:57] there could be more demand for really good fonts before long
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:39:21] I believe so. Keeps getting better.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[12:43:56] It through me for a loop when points and pixels started to differ. I was so used to 72 points in an inch and using points and pixels interchangeably.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:02:28] pingu2, well, my laptop screen here (HP) is 146dpi and this monitor is I think 100
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:06:44] Higher resolutions started showing up some time ago. Maybe 15 years or so?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:07:01] well, off and on, all along, but getting more common
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:07:10] I had access to a 300dpi display (in theory) in 1986
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:07:21] designed for newspaper usage - it was 19"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:10:57] Makes sense. The first computer I sat in front of had a touch screen, in 1976. It was military. They can afford such things.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:13:01] i don't know what my main is.  standard 1080 25" i think
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:13:30] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:13:59] somewhere around 90?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:15:24] yep, 72 is an urban myth, really, isn't it.  i'm sure i knew that already.  comes up a lot making websites
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:16:04] Not a lot of 72ppi in that list, if any ;)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:16:32] i think it might stem the original svga or something
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:18:08] oh, no, orginal macintosh.  9", 72 ppi
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:19:25] 96 is more common
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:19:27] Big screen TVs had some really low ppi, like 21 :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:22:44] The higher the resolution gets, the less grid fitting is going to be an issue. I like that.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:25:38] diogenese, well, Web sites are made to 96dpi these days :P
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:25:58] over 600ppi font hinting becomes unimportant
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:27:19] at least in terms of grid fitting
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:35:14] Do browsers adjust the size for hi res screens? Like convert a 12px @ 96dpi to 75px @ 600dpi?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:35:45] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:35:54] px are defined to be 96ths of an inch in CSS
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:35:55] Nice to know that.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:36:00] not device pixels
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:36:46] I've been doing it wrong.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:38:35] A problem I've run into. I focus on one thing for a long time and when I look around the world has changed.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:40:06] ah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:40:16] it's hat happens if you wear shoes too often :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:40:27] It's the shoes, yes.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:40:27] (or live in a barrel, perhaps?)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:40:38] It's a tub.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:40:43] :D
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:44:04] I almost never wore shoes when I lived in Micronesia. Flip-flops maybe, like to school.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [13:44:20] nods
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:45:53] They tried to enforce a dress code there, forcing everybody to wear shoes to school and my friend, David, showed up with the tops of sneakers, no bottoms.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:46:05] hah what happened?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:46:22] He was wearing shoes. What could they do?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:46:48] They didn't send him home and stopped enforcing that stupid rule.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:47:09] sounds good
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:49:02] I didn't notice my last GF had vanished for about 3 months : /
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:50:53] ??
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:53:32] looking around and the world has changed.  she sent me a breakup email, apparently.  we eventually caught up, and she told me she'd seen me since she sent it.  i think sometimes i get a bit distracted.  new years res to take a break and a look around occasionally
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:54:11] and wear shoes less often. Or get a boyfriend instead? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:54:25] (or both)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[13:56:21] maybe.  i could swing both ways on paper.  i need women really, for the biologicals
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:56:37] ah :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:57:02] My last hike, followed a guy that was hiking the Pacific Crest Train in tevas. Almost barefoot. For long hikes that's considered insane. He was fast too. Never caught up to him.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:57:11] *trail
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:57:31] the people who consider it insane are clearly insane :) but what does almost barefoot mean?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:58:27] I don't think it's possible barefoot. At least it hasn't been done afaik.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:58:46] 5000km over rough terrain.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:58:46] oh, in tevas, missed that
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[13:59:14] yeah, i don't know, coast to coast has, both in US and Canada (although not in the winter in Canada in recorded history afaik!)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:59:30] Nice
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[13:59:50] If you're not trying to break records, I'm sure it could be done.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	pingu2	[14:00:17] i guess you'd adapt after a while.  i was watching an interesting thing about shaolin monks recently.  they condition themselves to the extent that you could hit them over the head a mallet and it'd bounce right off
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[14:00:19] probably. "received wisdom" often isn't all that wise or universal
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[14:00:31] boing!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[14:01:14] e.g. when trying to develop a jumping shoe, reebok commissioned a study comparing various shoes for the high-jump, and the study actually found the control group (bare feet) did best
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[14:01:31] to their credit they published it anyway, since theirs was the most effective of the shoes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[14:14:54] Apparently, quite a few have done the Appalachian trial barefoot. It's an easier trail, but still amazing: http://appalachiantrail.com/books/barefoot-sisters
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:13:34] diogenese: hey:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:13:42] i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.

2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-22 21:50:28	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now
2014-01-22 21:50:28	 *	Ankh [01:51:05] off again
2014-01-22 21:50:28	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok

2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-22 21:50:28	Rickta59	[03:15:12] your awesome .. thanks
2014-01-22 21:50:28	diogenese	[03:15:32] Good luck ;)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-22 21:50:28	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:44:38] adamw used to be very active in Mandriva at one point
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:45:06] he seems to've made the jump to Mageia, like most of us :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:49:56] Ankh: of course :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:50:25] (running mageia 4 here)

2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:52:13] I fondly respect AdamW as a community manager happy to see him follow the crowd :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:53:10] and there's a photo of the people who started mageia holding a card with that bug number crossed out as resolved fixed
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:53:23] Ankh: that was a long time ago :) (2 years at least)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:53:28] yes, adamw did a lot of good for mandriva
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:53:29] yes, it was
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:54:04] now mandriva seems to be striving well, and mageia too
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:56:35] I don't hear too much abut Mandriva these days though
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:57:30] that's as accurate as it has always been :-)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:58:00] there are liars, bad liars, and statistics :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[11:58:04] indeed
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:59:29] linux mint seems to have a working bot in the long run (without so many users) :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	baud	[11:59:56] happy to see debian before ubuntu :)
2014-01-22 21:50:28	Ankh	[12:00:18] yeah, I should compare my own Web site's statistics

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:35:54] px are defined to be 96ths of an inch in CSS
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:35:55] Nice to know that.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:36:00] not device pixels
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:36:46] I've been doing it wrong.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:38:35] A problem I've run into. I focus on one thing for a long time and when I look around the world has changed.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:40:06] ah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:40:16] it's hat happens if you wear shoes too often :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:40:27] It's the shoes, yes.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:40:27] (or live in a barrel, perhaps?)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:40:38] It's a tub.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:40:43] :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:44:04] I almost never wore shoes when I lived in Micronesia. Flip-flops maybe, like to school.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	Ankh [13:44:20] nods
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:45:53] They tried to enforce a dress code there, forcing everybody to wear shoes to school and my friend, David, showed up with the tops of sneakers, no bottoms.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:46:05] hah what happened?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:46:22] He was wearing shoes. What could they do?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:46:48] They didn't send him home and stopped enforcing that stupid rule.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:47:09] sounds good
2014-01-26 10:12:44	pingu2	[13:49:02] I didn't notice my last GF had vanished for about 3 months : /
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:50:53] ??
2014-01-26 10:12:44	pingu2	[13:53:32] looking around and the world has changed.  she sent me a breakup email, apparently.  we eventually caught up, and she told me she'd seen me since she sent it.  i think sometimes i get a bit distracted.  new years res to take a break and a look around occasionally
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:54:11] and wear shoes less often. Or get a boyfriend instead? :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:54:25] (or both)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	pingu2	[13:56:21] maybe.  i could swing both ways on paper.  i need women really, for the biologicals
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:56:37] ah :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:57:02] My last hike, followed a guy that was hiking the Pacific Crest Train in tevas. Almost barefoot. For long hikes that's considered insane. He was fast too. Never caught up to him.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:57:11] *trail
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:57:31] the people who consider it insane are clearly insane :) but what does almost barefoot mean?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:58:27] I don't think it's possible barefoot. At least it hasn't been done afaik.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:58:46] 5000km over rough terrain.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:58:46] oh, in tevas, missed that
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[13:59:14] yeah, i don't know, coast to coast has, both in US and Canada (although not in the winter in Canada in recorded history afaik!)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:59:30] Nice
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[13:59:50] If you're not trying to break records, I'm sure it could be done.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	pingu2	[14:00:17] i guess you'd adapt after a while.  i was watching an interesting thing about shaolin monks recently.  they condition themselves to the extent that you could hit them over the head a mallet and it'd bounce right off
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[14:00:19] probably. "received wisdom" often isn't all that wise or universal
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[14:00:31] boing!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[14:01:14] e.g. when trying to develop a jumping shoe, reebok commissioned a study comparing various shoes for the high-jump, and the study actually found the control group (bare feet) did best
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[14:01:31] to their credit they published it anyway, since theirs was the most effective of the shoes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[14:14:54] Apparently, quite a few have done the Appalachian trial barefoot. It's an easier trail, but still amazing: http://appalachiantrail.com/books/barefoot-sisters
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:13:34] diogenese: hey:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:13:42] i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget

2014-01-26 10:12:44	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Rickta59	[03:15:12] your awesome .. thanks
2014-01-26 10:12:44	diogenese	[03:15:32] Good luck ;)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[11:45:06] he seems to've made the jump to Mageia, like most of us :)

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[11:53:10] and there's a photo of the people who started mageia holding a card with that bug number crossed out as resolved fixed

2014-01-26 10:12:44	baud	[11:54:04] now mandriva seems to be striving well, and mageia too
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[11:56:35] I don't hear too much abut Mandriva these days though
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-26 10:12:44	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help

2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)

2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:39:16] More like a word processor/simple desktop publishing application
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-26 10:12:44	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-26 10:12:44	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-26 10:12:44	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)

2014-01-26 10:13:26	JanC	in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-26 10:13:45	Ankh	i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-26 10:13:56	Ankh	although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-26 10:14:53	JanC	well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-26 10:15:54	iron_houzi	They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-26 10:16:07	Ankh	ok
2014-01-26 10:16:29	iron_houzi	I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-26 10:16:50	Ankh	yeah, it may be of use.

2014-01-26 10:28:40	Ankh	I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-26 10:28:57	JanC	do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-26 10:29:00	Ankh	I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:54:11] and wear shoes less often. Or get a boyfriend instead? :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:54:25] (or both)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	pingu2	[13:56:21] maybe.  i could swing both ways on paper.  i need women really, for the biologicals
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:56:37] ah :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:57:02] My last hike, followed a guy that was hiking the Pacific Crest Train in tevas. Almost barefoot. For long hikes that's considered insane. He was fast too. Never caught up to him.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:57:11] *trail
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:57:31] the people who consider it insane are clearly insane :) but what does almost barefoot mean?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:58:27] I don't think it's possible barefoot. At least it hasn't been done afaik.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:58:46] 5000km over rough terrain.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:58:46] oh, in tevas, missed that
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[13:59:14] yeah, i don't know, coast to coast has, both in US and Canada (although not in the winter in Canada in recorded history afaik!)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:59:30] Nice
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[13:59:50] If you're not trying to break records, I'm sure it could be done.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	pingu2	[14:00:17] i guess you'd adapt after a while.  i was watching an interesting thing about shaolin monks recently.  they condition themselves to the extent that you could hit them over the head a mallet and it'd bounce right off
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[14:00:19] probably. "received wisdom" often isn't all that wise or universal
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[14:00:31] boing!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[14:01:14] e.g. when trying to develop a jumping shoe, reebok commissioned a study comparing various shoes for the high-jump, and the study actually found the control group (bare feet) did best
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[14:01:31] to their credit they published it anyway, since theirs was the most effective of the shoes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[14:14:54] Apparently, quite a few have done the Appalachian trial barefoot. It's an easier trail, but still amazing: http://appalachiantrail.com/books/barefoot-sisters
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:13:34] diogenese: hey:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:13:42] i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-27 20:13:56	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now

2014-01-27 20:13:56	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-27 20:13:56	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-27 20:13:56	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:07:15] here on freenode?

2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:07:51] and not 4chan either ;)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:07:59] most typographers being older than six :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:36:09] http://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:37:03] Ankh: Sorry. My server suddenly stalled
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:37:09] that's alright
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:37:15] http://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:39:16] More like a word processor/simple desktop publishing application
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-01-27 20:13:56	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-01-27 20:13:56	Ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-01-27 20:13:56	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges

2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:13:34] diogenese: hey:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:13:42] i have to go to work now ...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-28 09:22:42	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now

2014-01-28 09:22:42	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	obiwahn	[06:18:20] i was misinterpreting what you wrote

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:45:06] he seems to've made the jump to Mageia, like most of us :)

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:53:10] and there's a photo of the people who started mageia holding a card with that bug number crossed out as resolved fixed
2014-01-28 09:22:42	baud	[11:53:23] Ankh: that was a long time ago :) (2 years at least)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:53:28] yes, adamw did a lot of good for mandriva
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:53:29] yes, it was
2014-01-28 09:22:42	baud	[11:54:04] now mandriva seems to be striving well, and mageia too
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:56:35] I don't hear too much abut Mandriva these days though
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	baud	[11:57:30] that's as accurate as it has always been :-)

2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-28 09:22:42	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:07:15] here on freenode?

2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:07:59] most typographers being older than six :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)

2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit

2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	Ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-01-28 09:22:42	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[03:14:03] From what I can tell. Open/FreeType fonts have some lookup tables. This leads me to believe that there is some programming code stored somewhere in the font. Does Fontforge have any ability to let the user browse this code, or is there any other way to browse how the lookups are defined?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[04:55:20] iron_houzi: what do you exactly need to do?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[04:57:56] Please have a look at the bottom part of this document: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm - The first example in the section entitled "Examples of Tibetan: You will see that 3 or 4 Unicode codepoints are formed into one ligature, with the help of blws lookup StackLigatures. Something that is highly needed when dealing with the Tibetan script is to have ligature caret
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[04:57:59] definitions for all those 3-4 code points. Does the Freetype standard support this type of "vertical" ligature caret definitions?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[04:58:22] s/Freetype/Harfbuzz/
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:05:54] iron_houzi: no.  1. OpenType standard currently doesn't support vertical ligature carets in a horizontal writing direction.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:06:10] 2. No platform using HarfBuzz supports ligature carets whatsoever.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[05:06:11] Noooo! I'm so sad.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:06:18] We plan on fixing both eventually....
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:06:49] iron_houzi: it's best to write to harfbuzz list for useful discussion.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:06:56] Not many people frequent here.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[05:06:58] behdad: I just realize who you are. You're the guy who does the GPU rendering of fonts. I saw your presentation. Very cool!
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:07:08] And of course, it's good for posterity to have discussion in the archives.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:07:15] iron_houzi: lol.  yeah.
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[05:09:39] I'm honoured to get to discuss this with you. What I am asking for here is quintessensial to my project. I'm a CS undergrad, just barely starting to get a handle on the basics .. I am thinking that perhaps I need to create my own renderer if I want this non-standard features. What are your thoughts on that?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:25:04] iron_houzi: You are definitely welcome to do such experiments, and I'm supportive of that.  You can definitely get started doing that by hacking harfbuzz and fonttools
2014-01-28 09:22:42	behdad	[05:25:14] gtg.  Write to harfbuzz list to keep discussion going?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[05:25:19] behdad: I've joined the mailing list. As I've already stated, I'm quite new to everythin. I'm halfway through my bachelor in CS, so I have a handle on coding in C. Is there any documentation on harfbuzz and fonttools?
2014-01-28 09:22:42	iron_houzi	[05:26:03] ..OK. I'll start something on the mailing list.

2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-28 12:39:00	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	Ankh [01:51:05] off again
2014-01-28 12:39:00	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.

2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-28 12:39:00	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-28 12:39:00	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-28 12:39:00	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)

2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-28 12:39:00	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-28 12:39:00	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:07:15] here on freenode?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:26] o
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:28] bo
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:30] argh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:31] no
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:07:35] reddt?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:44] http://typophile.com/
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:07:48] Thanks
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:51] and not 4chan either ;)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:07:59] most typographers being older than six :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:36:09] http://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:37:03] Ankh: Sorry. My server suddenly stalled
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:37:09] that's alright
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:37:15] http://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:39:16] More like a word processor/simple desktop publishing application
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-28 12:39:00	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-28 12:39:00	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	Ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-01-28 12:39:01	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[03:14:03] From what I can tell. Open/FreeType fonts have some lookup tables. This leads me to believe that there is some programming code stored somewhere in the font. Does Fontforge have any ability to let the user browse this code, or is there any other way to browse how the lookups are defined?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[04:55:20] iron_houzi: what do you exactly need to do?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[04:57:56] Please have a look at the bottom part of this document: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm - The first example in the section entitled "Examples of Tibetan: You will see that 3 or 4 Unicode codepoints are formed into one ligature, with the help of blws lookup StackLigatures. Something that is highly needed when dealing with the Tibetan script is to have ligature caret
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[04:57:59] definitions for all those 3-4 code points. Does the Freetype standard support this type of "vertical" ligature caret definitions?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[04:58:22] s/Freetype/Harfbuzz/
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:05:54] iron_houzi: no.  1. OpenType standard currently doesn't support vertical ligature carets in a horizontal writing direction.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:06:10] 2. No platform using HarfBuzz supports ligature carets whatsoever.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[05:06:11] Noooo! I'm so sad.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:06:18] We plan on fixing both eventually....
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:06:49] iron_houzi: it's best to write to harfbuzz list for useful discussion.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:06:56] Not many people frequent here.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[05:06:58] behdad: I just realize who you are. You're the guy who does the GPU rendering of fonts. I saw your presentation. Very cool!
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:07:08] And of course, it's good for posterity to have discussion in the archives.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:07:15] iron_houzi: lol.  yeah.
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[05:09:39] I'm honoured to get to discuss this with you. What I am asking for here is quintessensial to my project. I'm a CS undergrad, just barely starting to get a handle on the basics .. I am thinking that perhaps I need to create my own renderer if I want this non-standard features. What are your thoughts on that?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:25:04] iron_houzi: You are definitely welcome to do such experiments, and I'm supportive of that.  You can definitely get started doing that by hacking harfbuzz and fonttools
2014-01-28 12:39:01	behdad	[05:25:14] gtg.  Write to harfbuzz list to keep discussion going?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[05:25:19] behdad: I've joined the mailing list. As I've already stated, I'm quite new to everythin. I'm halfway through my bachelor in CS, so I have a handle on coding in C. Is there any documentation on harfbuzz and fonttools?
2014-01-28 12:39:01	iron_houzi	[05:26:03] ..OK. I'll start something on the mailing list.

2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[15:13:54] it is a symbol in the private use area
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:14:21] Yes, we were chatting about that earlier. Check in when you come back.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[15:14:28] i have tried to play with fontforge and already found the symbol
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:14:44] You just need to adjust the bearings.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[15:15:00] it was kind of complex which tool would you recommend?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:15:37] It's the best tool for this.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:17:30] Basically, you open the font, find the glyph. Double click on it and play with ctrl-r and ctrl-l until the advance matches the other glyphs and that glyph is just over (one unit) the right bearing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:18:03] *of the right bearing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[15:18:30] then i will ask later for help ... it is the first time i try to modify a font and it seems pretty complex .. mostly because i do not understand the technical terms
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[15:19:16] There is extensive help for it too.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[15:19:44] ill try that:) thank you!!!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[16:59:43] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3aaf97b2960.48760509.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:00:59] would i incremet or decremet the right bearing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:02:31] I'd start with left, but before that, either hit any key to open another tab with another glyph (to see the advance), then you know how much it needs to move over.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:03:07] Or you can click on any other glyph. It should be monospaced, to the advance should be the same for all.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:04:18] i am looking here to figure out what is waht:o http://fontforge.org/editexample5.html
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:04:40] It's extensive.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:05:03] i think the right bearing is set to -1 or that is waht is shown when i press ctrl r
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:05:28] setting it to 0 should bring the arrow to the right position?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:05:34] You see the 2 vertical line on both side of the glyph? Those are the left and right bearings. You can set those with ctrl-l and ctrl-r respectively.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:05:36] from whre do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:06:13] diogenese: where do i see the surrounding box ot the space the letter and background take up?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:06:16] If you open another glyph, it will have those as well, but the distance between them is the proper advance.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:08:08] mh
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1

2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[01:49:43] ?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[01:49:50] ah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[01:50:05] there's a mailing list for openfontlibrary.org
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[01:50:11] or maybe it's the CREATE list, I forget
2014-01-28 20:56:54	digit	[01:50:21] also getting 404 on http://openfontlibrary.org/guidebook/License?pretty=wiki/License#Uploads
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[01:50:59] i don't know if any openfontlibrary people are around right now

2014-01-28 20:56:54	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:13:44] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans in german they are called something like "whoreson" and "shoemaker apprentice/boy" - First i was not sure if it was related to printing ...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok

2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:25:00] i'm trying to identify a font, thought someone here might be able to help
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-28 20:56:54	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:45:06] he seems to've made the jump to Mageia, like most of us :)

2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:53:10] and there's a photo of the people who started mageia holding a card with that bug number crossed out as resolved fixed
2014-01-28 20:56:54	baud	[11:53:23] Ankh: that was a long time ago :) (2 years at least)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:53:28] yes, adamw did a lot of good for mandriva
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:53:29] yes, it was
2014-01-28 20:56:54	baud	[11:54:04] now mandriva seems to be striving well, and mageia too
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:56:35] I don't hear too much abut Mandriva these days though
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-28 20:56:54	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help

2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)

2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit

2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	Ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-01-28 20:56:54	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[03:14:03] From what I can tell. Open/FreeType fonts have some lookup tables. This leads me to believe that there is some programming code stored somewhere in the font. Does Fontforge have any ability to let the user browse this code, or is there any other way to browse how the lookups are defined?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[04:55:20] iron_houzi: what do you exactly need to do?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[04:57:56] Please have a look at the bottom part of this document: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm - The first example in the section entitled "Examples of Tibetan: You will see that 3 or 4 Unicode codepoints are formed into one ligature, with the help of blws lookup StackLigatures. Something that is highly needed when dealing with the Tibetan script is to have ligature caret
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[04:57:59] definitions for all those 3-4 code points. Does the Freetype standard support this type of "vertical" ligature caret definitions?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[04:58:22] s/Freetype/Harfbuzz/
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:05:54] iron_houzi: no.  1. OpenType standard currently doesn't support vertical ligature carets in a horizontal writing direction.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:06:10] 2. No platform using HarfBuzz supports ligature carets whatsoever.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[05:06:11] Noooo! I'm so sad.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:06:18] We plan on fixing both eventually....
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:06:49] iron_houzi: it's best to write to harfbuzz list for useful discussion.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:06:56] Not many people frequent here.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[05:06:58] behdad: I just realize who you are. You're the guy who does the GPU rendering of fonts. I saw your presentation. Very cool!
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:07:08] And of course, it's good for posterity to have discussion in the archives.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:07:15] iron_houzi: lol.  yeah.
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[05:09:39] I'm honoured to get to discuss this with you. What I am asking for here is quintessensial to my project. I'm a CS undergrad, just barely starting to get a handle on the basics .. I am thinking that perhaps I need to create my own renderer if I want this non-standard features. What are your thoughts on that?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:25:04] iron_houzi: You are definitely welcome to do such experiments, and I'm supportive of that.  You can definitely get started doing that by hacking harfbuzz and fonttools
2014-01-28 20:56:54	behdad	[05:25:14] gtg.  Write to harfbuzz list to keep discussion going?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[05:25:19] behdad: I've joined the mailing list. As I've already stated, I'm quite new to everythin. I'm halfway through my bachelor in CS, so I have a handle on coding in C. Is there any documentation on harfbuzz and fonttools?
2014-01-28 20:56:54	iron_houzi	[05:26:03] ..OK. I'll start something on the mailing list.

2014-01-31 02:37:10	kibogol	I know its not conventional.
2014-01-31 02:48:13	kibogol	Looking at my OTF files, all I see have different files for bold and italic variants. I'm not sure OTF can handle even packing them into the same file.
2014-01-31 03:15:04	behdad	kibogol: yes and no
2014-01-31 03:15:19	behdad	kibogol: It's called TrueType Collection, or TTC
2014-01-31 03:15:38	behdad	kibogol: it's technically only defined for TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, not PostScript/CFF-flavored ones.
2014-01-31 03:15:42	behdad	But both work on Linux at least.
2014-01-31 03:17:03	kibogol	Yucky specification!
2014-01-31 03:17:45	kibogol	(that OTF would handle them so differently)
2014-01-31 03:41:15	JanC	it's TrueType Collection, not OpenType Collection  ;)
2014-01-31 03:44:18	JanC	so I guess TTC & OTF are both "forks" of TTF, but nobody merged them (officially)

2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:08:19] where do i read the advance?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:08:36] it is not the distance between the bearings or is it?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:08:37] You might need to zoom in on the right one.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:10:06] http://fontforge.org/sidebearings.png
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:10:07] The left should always be zero, the right shows the advance.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:10:13] i see the bule stuff
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:10:31] but not the lines that define the advance
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:10:55] blue
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:12:02] the right side bearing seems to be always 517
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:12:21] For all the other glyphs?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:12:27] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:12:34] and for this one as well
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:13:33] Funny, they look wider on the vim pick.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:13:39] how do i set the bearing to 0
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:14:47] just press ctrl-r and change -1 to 0 and go?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:15:05] The arrow has a left bearing of 0, a right of 517, but the glyph is 518 wide, one unit longer than the advance.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:15:51] mh now when i try to save it wants to create a sfd
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:16:25] i hoped it would just modify the PowerlineSymbols.otf
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:17:10] The ctrl-l and ctrl-r set the distance between the bearing and the glyph. ctrl-r should be -1 on the arrow. ctrl-l should be 0. From what I can see on the vim pic. The other glyphs are wider than that.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:18:22] What I mean by the other glyphs, is glyphs not in the powerline otf, but the font you patched it too.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:19:46] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3afab08a671.27477994.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:20:02] i am a bit confused about what i did and what i have changed
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:20:30] i ran fontforge PowerLine.otf
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:20:38] so i expected this file to change
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:21:09] I see, it's just the powerline glyphs you're looking at. What font is used with it for the text?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:24:56] Without knowing that width, you can try this to see what I mean. Hit ctrl-l, click on 'Set LBearing to' (leave the mouse pointer in the entry box) and set to 90, then click OK
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:26:14] You'll notice the glyph has moved over 90 units, but the right bearing is now off. ctrl-r, do the same with the entry and set it to -1. 90 is just a guess, but should be close.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:26:41] i use it with dejavu sans mono
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:27:20] https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:27:26] Ah, if you open that, it will show up in a new window, that has the advance we're looking for.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:27:36] that is the guide i have been following
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:27:42] Is it otf or ttf?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:28:18] I thought the python patch added the powerline glyphs to the font. Did you do that?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:28:53] If they've been added to the deja vu mono font, that's the font we need to be working on.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:36:09] /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSansMono.ttf
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:36:16] that is the font
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:36:34] i have put the otf file in the .fonts dir in my home
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:37:13] did a fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:37:49] Was the DejaVuSansMono.ttf patched according to the instructions? If so we need to open that and find 0xe0b2. That font is loaded with glyphs so it might take a while.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:38:16] and put the https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#font-installation
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:38:23] sorry wrong link:(
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:38:57] and put the ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-powerline-symbols.conf in place
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:40:34] I'm reading it again. Quickly scanned it last time.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:41:48] probably insane to try to tweak a font with no background on it at all
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:43:34] Ok, not patched. Humour me on this. You still have the powerline font open? if so I think the correct left bearing needs to be 85, not 90.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:43:49] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:44:34] So, in that hit ctrl-l and enter 85. It's a little tricky. the mouse pointer needs to be in the box or very close.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:44:53] i have set the bearing to 0 and now the right line is at 518 instead of 517
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:44:55] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:45:52] You want that at 85, then you need to correct the right bearing to -1
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:46:20] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b5e2f288e1.44872716.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:47:02] See the right bearing is now off? Left looks right, right needs to be set to -1, the same way you set the left bearing.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:47:14] ctrl-r
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:47:16] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b61d09f3e8.52561008.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:47:18] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:48:03] now how do i save it so i can use it?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:48:06] Looks good. Now you export to otf, someplace other than where your current font is (just in case)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:48:39] I'd save a copy of the original somewhere, the replace with the corrected version.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:49:00] a copy is already saved:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:49:11] It's under file->generate font.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:49:41] That's the sdf you saved. to get an otf, you generate it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:50:41] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3b6e2db9a64.26653802.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:50:49] do i have to pick any special options?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:51:57] in the field that reads no bitmap fonts
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:52:07] there is an grey entry that mentions otf
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:52:08] The PS Type 1 needs to be OpenType (CFF), I think...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:52:36] It's not mac, and CID is something else.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:53:33] is no bitmaps fonts ok?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:53:44] there is a grey in ttf/otf that i can not select
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:53:50] Yes, those are for fixed strikes.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[17:54:25] mh the font contains errors bad prvate dictionary
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[17:55:41] I'm playing with it here. just a sec ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:02:51] Everything says to ignore that and hit save.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:03:56] ok:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:05:56] You'll need to run fc-cache again to update it once it's in place, then check and see how it looks or if more work needs to be done. 85 could be wrong.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:07:24] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-52d3bac9262257.90051514.jpg
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:07:59] it seems a bit too much
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:08:10] but now i know what i have to do
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:08:24] I was close :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:08:52] It looks like it's just short, the thin line.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:09:07] it looks a bit like the font is moved a little bit up
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:09:58] but far better than before:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:10:03] You know what's really cool? you can adjust those too :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:10:16] You can move those points :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:11:45] You could even make it take up the whole advance, you know enough now to adjust both of those, so they both do.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:12:56] You can drag those points around a bit, generate, fc-cache. Quick and easy.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:16:35] The powerline font should have an advance of 602 to match the deju font.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:17:37] i am still not sure how i see/read and set the advance
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:18:23] The ruler and the right bearing. Left bearing is always zero.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:19:28] so ruler+right bearing
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:19:35] = advance
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:20:29] The distance between the 2 vertical lines is the advance. Left is at zero, right is the advance.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:24:03] Not trying to confuse, but I got 602 from the deja vu font. It's truetype with uses 2048 units per em, opentype uses 1000 units per em. The deja vu font has and advance of 1233, so (1233/2048)*1000 ~= 602. I hope that's not too confusing.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:27:00] A lot like converting metric to Imperial.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:28:52] :) no not at all
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:29:05] i had phsyics as second
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:29:22] You have that much to play with the other powerline glyphs :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:31:24] another quick hint. If you right click on any point and choose 'info' at the bottom of the menu, you can enter exact numbers.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:38:30] oh nice
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:39:02] ill need to write some rst so i can look all that up in case i need it again:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:39:18] ill bug you probably alter a bit more
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:39:21] It gets easier :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[18:39:41] but now i need to get some work done:) ppl start bugging
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[18:39:56] Good luck.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	digit	[01:48:19] not funny guys.  first time, rejected because the zip didnt include the right format... second time, because i didnt include the license.  both times losing my carefully crafted description.   might wanna revise the http://openfontlibrary.org site a bit
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[01:49:43] ?

2014-01-31 16:50:27	digit	[01:51:24] ah well, i just needed to vent my frustration. XD  *looking through guidebook now*
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:44:36] diogenese: is it possible to generate a truetype font form what i got so i can use the font on windows?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:44:53] Yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:45:45] there is th option in generate fonts
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:46:07] but will that already merge with dejavu sans mono?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:47:52] First hit ctrl-shift-F, choose General and set the units per em to 2048, then generate the ttf
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:48:13] For powerline that is.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:49:13] If you merge the 2, then you don't need to generate the powerline ttf. the DejaVu truetype should work fine in windows.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:50:49] how do i merge them? can it be done with fontforge?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:53:29] Is 'units per em' ~ 'em size'?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:54:08] diogenese: how many people work on a font like dejavu sans?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:55:00] I believe a team has worked very hard to create that family. It supports a great number of glyph.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:55:09] and has all work to be done with fontforge or could inkscape or illustrator be used?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:55:26] Not sure.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:55:42] do you create glyphs?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:56:06] Some. I created on font, just to learn how fontforge works.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:56:15] one
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:56:29] is your work font related?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:56:33] It has around 1500 glyphs in it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:56:42] No, not any more.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[05:57:37] Aha - So it was:) What are you doing now?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:58:30] I was a journeyman typographer in the International Typographical Union, which dissolved around 1980. We were replaced by computers.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[05:59:22] The name is misleading. The International was added when the USA included Canada.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[06:00:15] Wow then you are probably a bit older than me:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:00:27] I'm getting up there.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[06:00:48] does that get you access to the typographic circl's club in toronto? :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:01:20] I would think. That was, at one time, the most powerful union in the Americas.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[06:01:20] i was born one year after the the union was dissolved:)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:02:05] We brought everybody the 40 hour work week :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:02:32] I think there's something in wikipedia about it. Looking

2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:13:58] It is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[06:14:18] but pretty hard names
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[06:14:52] none of the names for them really make sense
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[06:14:59] I often muddle up widows and orphans
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:16:37] We added spaces between paragraphs, or in some cases between the lines, to avoid them.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:17:11] Really bothers me when I see one.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[06:17:17] uhm - why?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[06:18:00] For one, ugly. It also makes the paragraph harder to read.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	obiwahn	[06:18:04] lah ok

2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:25:21] http://beaufortwineandfood.com/images/BWF-Home-header.jpg ...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:25:37] on that image the 10th Annual .. I'm trying to figure out what that is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:26:34] i've tried http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ and it successfully identifies the Felix Titling .. on the other text but it doesn't seem to know what the script font is
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:46:27] Good luck finding the name. Not many people can identify them by sight. I've been to Beaufort. Help a friend move down there. He was planning on opening a restaurant there. I didn't see it on that site.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:47:01] *Helped
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:54:23] nice .. does he want to be a sponsor?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:54:48] : )
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:55:26] the deep descenders seem like it would be a easy tell
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:55:27] I wouldn't know. Last I talk to him was about 15 years ago. I was curious how he might be doing.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:55:53] do you know the name of the restraunt he opened?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:56:35] He was going to call it A Taste of Maine, was the old Goose Hollow Inn, iirc
2014-01-31 16:50:27	Rickta59	[00:57:07] interesting .. neither of those are ones I've heard of
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:57:38] He may have named it something else. Would be nice to know :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[00:57:51] Nice area there. Very green.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[02:57:36] Rickta59: I may have found your font. One of the Scriptina variants.

2014-01-31 16:50:27	diogenese	[03:15:32] Good luck ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sgfgdf	[02:34:43] hello, guys! can anyone help me find this font name -- http://www.modra-publishing.com/P1060408.jpg ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[03:29:21] sgfgdf, are you sure it's not a bios console font from a PC?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sgfgdf	[03:58:40] Ankh, it is from the booting proccess of OS X. i talked with other people and have been told that it probably is a bitmap font which have to be used with the resolution it was made for.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[04:00:43] yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[04:01:00] well, what is it that you like about it and what's your intended use?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sgfgdf	[04:03:47] Ankh, well nothing special, i was just curious to find and test it. what i liked is that it seems like a good monospaced font.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[04:05:47] I see. Yeah, it looks like a bitmap font, and that's usually what's used in a bios or even a custom boot font
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[04:06:13] as it needs a lot less memory than a scalable font, and it only gets used at one size anyway
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sgfgdf	[04:19:58] Ankh, can i find where the font is located anyway? i couldn't find source about OS X boot font.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	sgfgdf	[05:16:41] Ankh, anyway. i have to go so i want to thank you for the information!

2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)

2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-01-31 16:50:27	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:07:15] here on freenode?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:26] o
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:28] bo
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:30] argh
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:31] no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:07:35] reddt?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:44] http://typophile.com/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:07:48] Thanks
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:51] and not 4chan either ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:07:59] most typographers being older than six :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:36:09] http://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMBhttp://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:37:03] Ankh: Sorry. My server suddenly stalled
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:37:09] that's alright
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:37:15] http://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:39:16] More like a word processor/simple desktop publishing application
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[03:14:03] From what I can tell. Open/FreeType fonts have some lookup tables. This leads me to believe that there is some programming code stored somewhere in the font. Does Fontforge have any ability to let the user browse this code, or is there any other way to browse how the lookups are defined?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[04:55:20] iron_houzi: what do you exactly need to do?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[04:57:56] Please have a look at the bottom part of this document: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm - The first example in the section entitled "Examples of Tibetan: You will see that 3 or 4 Unicode codepoints are formed into one ligature, with the help of blws lookup StackLigatures. Something that is highly needed when dealing with the Tibetan script is to have ligature caret
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[04:57:59] definitions for all those 3-4 code points. Does the Freetype standard support this type of "vertical" ligature caret definitions?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[04:58:22] s/Freetype/Harfbuzz/
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:05:54] iron_houzi: no.  1. OpenType standard currently doesn't support vertical ligature carets in a horizontal writing direction.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:06:10] 2. No platform using HarfBuzz supports ligature carets whatsoever.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[05:06:11] Noooo! I'm so sad.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:06:18] We plan on fixing both eventually....
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:06:49] iron_houzi: it's best to write to harfbuzz list for useful discussion.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:06:56] Not many people frequent here.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[05:06:58] behdad: I just realize who you are. You're the guy who does the GPU rendering of fonts. I saw your presentation. Very cool!
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:07:08] And of course, it's good for posterity to have discussion in the archives.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:07:15] iron_houzi: lol.  yeah.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[05:09:39] I'm honoured to get to discuss this with you. What I am asking for here is quintessensial to my project. I'm a CS undergrad, just barely starting to get a handle on the basics .. I am thinking that perhaps I need to create my own renderer if I want this non-standard features. What are your thoughts on that?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:25:04] iron_houzi: You are definitely welcome to do such experiments, and I'm supportive of that.  You can definitely get started doing that by hacking harfbuzz and fonttools
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[05:25:14] gtg.  Write to harfbuzz list to keep discussion going?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[05:25:19] behdad: I've joined the mailing list. As I've already stated, I'm quite new to everythin. I'm halfway through my bachelor in CS, so I have a handle on coding in C. Is there any documentation on harfbuzz and fonttools?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	iron_houzi	[05:26:03] ..OK. I'll start something on the mailing list.

2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[23:21:09] I'm  trying to use fontmatrix to compare fonts for specific characters. How can I do that? or compare at all?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[23:21:30] The WWW site is in Japanese, if it is still the same. The program does not load documentation.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[23:23:47] I think I figured out how to compare single characters in a list it provides.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[23:25:06] Some sequences which can be rendered together (i forget the word) , like ffi, have their own code points? I didn't know that.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[23:44:43] kibogol: the word is 'ligature'
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[01:59:36] Is there a tool on GNU/Linux which can bundle a typeface which is in pfb files into otf?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[02:00:04] I have a typeface which has regular & bold pfb files, and want to bundle it into a single OTF file.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[02:36:39] Can multiple typefaces(families) be bundled into a single OTF file?
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[02:37:10] I know its not conventional.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[02:48:13] Looking at my OTF files, all I see have different files for bold and italic variants. I'm not sure OTF can handle even packing them into the same file.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[03:15:04] kibogol: yes and no
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[03:15:19] kibogol: It's called TrueType Collection, or TTC
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[03:15:38] kibogol: it's technically only defined for TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, not PostScript/CFF-flavored ones.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	behdad	[03:15:42] But both work on Linux at least.
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[03:17:03] Yucky specification!
2014-01-31 16:50:27	kibogol	[03:17:45] (that OTF would handle them so differently)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[03:41:15] it's TrueType Collection, not OpenType Collection  ;)
2014-01-31 16:50:27	JanC	[03:44:18] so I guess TTC & OTF are both "forks" of TTF, but nobody merged them (officially)

2014-02-01 15:33:58	 *	ankh off to empty the dogs
2014-02-01 15:34:18	pingu2	i missed the question.  just joined.  could i get a paste?
2014-02-01 15:35:34	diogenese	<edakiri> What are ways to make a new typeface file which includes glyphs like falling back finds them. Where a glyph is present in one typeface file, it is included in the new file; where it is missing, it includes the glyph from a second source into the new file. on unix.
2014-02-01 15:37:13	pingu2	oh. i guess that's more down to the software presenting the info.  i don't think there's anything in font technology itself to provide for that
2014-02-01 15:45:50	edakiri	pingu2: I don't want to make a font file which designates fallbacks, I want to make a new font file which is a union of 2 others.
2014-02-01 15:46:11	edakiri	with precedence for which glyph is chosen by intersection/collision.
2014-02-01 15:46:27	pingu2	oh.  i think i misread the question
2014-02-01 15:46:57	pingu2	i have a tool here for combining manually http://fontcombiner.com/create
2014-02-01 15:47:18	pingu2	i'm not all that happy with the autospacing to be honest
2014-02-01 15:47:32	edakiri	pingu2: it's not there
2014-02-01 15:47:41	pingu2	you get an error?
2014-02-01 15:48:08	edakiri	"We're very sorry, there was a problem"

2014-02-01 15:48:46	pingu2	try a refresh on the page?
2014-02-01 15:51:48	pingu2	that won't help with anything automated anyway.  i guess if it's a one off, you could probably script something using either fontforge or ttxfonttools?  i imagine some sort of ttx | output | some other pipe magic might do it.  there's a can of worms when it comes to character spacing or kerning, though

2014-02-01 16:02:54	pingu2	oh gosh
2014-02-01 16:03:05	pingu2	what browser is that?!
2014-02-01 16:03:14	edakiri	firefox/iceweasel
2014-02-01 16:03:21	pingu2	version number?
2014-02-01 16:03:29	edakiri	26.0
2014-02-01 16:03:42	pingu2	that's a little scary
2014-02-01 16:04:50	pingu2	this is probably the last thing a web coder should say, really, because it's a cop out, but i think your browser is broken
2014-02-01 16:06:26	edakiri	One of the real problems is that you don't use the users' size for text. You set another size.
2014-02-01 16:06:49	edakiri	That causes the text out of bounds because I have a minimum text size set to counter bad web design.
2014-02-01 16:08:04	pingu2	that's necessary when dealing with buttons, i think, really.  you can't place every button in an application with a changeable size
2014-02-01 16:08:56	edakiri	Yes, you can. They can flow.
2014-02-01 16:09:05	pingu2	i guess you could set everything to overflow hidden
2014-02-01 16:09:42	edakiri	I wasn't talking about overflow, I meant that the buttons don't need to be in a fixed position, just as a word does not.
2014-02-01 16:10:18	edakiri	That and relative positioning can be used for most anything.
2014-02-01 16:10:49	edakiri	But trying to do this kind of thing in a web browser is trying to use the wrong tool, IMO.
2014-02-01 16:11:08	pingu2	you are actually talking about a custom stylesheet that breaks the website.  i can't cater for that, not really.
2014-02-01 16:11:16	edakiri	--if you want many buttons and complex UI.
2014-02-01 16:12:12	edakiri	I'm using the usual facilities, plus minimum font size enforcement. I can cater to it. I don't know why you can't.
2014-02-01 16:12:41	pingu2	no one does that
2014-02-01 16:12:59	pingu2	either sets minium font sizes or tries to cater for people who do
2014-02-01 16:13:32	edakiri	Hobbyists 15 years ago did a better job. No reason to accept less now.
2014-02-01 16:14:31	edakiri	Everything should work with the users colors and font settings.
2014-02-01 16:15:19	edakiri	I don't mean use the user's default colors for everything, but work regardless of them.
2014-02-01 16:16:59	pingu2	sounds a bit illogical to me.  you're forcing the browser to use a styles other than those provided by the site, and other than the defaults for the agent.  there is no way to compensate for that
2014-02-01 16:17:03	ankh	 a lot of people set minimum font sizes in their browsers. I do too.
2014-02-01 16:17:22	pingu2	why not just zoom in?
2014-02-01 16:17:28	ankh	pingu2, it's actally fundamental to the design of CSS that users can override the browser's default stylesheet
2014-02-01 16:17:49	ankh	zooming in typically requires horizontal scrolling (although I do zoom in a lot)
2014-02-01 16:17:54	edakiri	The colors I have set are default web ones. It is only the effect of minimum font size which you notice in that image.
2014-02-01 16:18:13	pingu2	i think you're right, yep.  hopefully that's all it is
2014-02-01 16:27:56	pingu2	still, you can't allow for that sort of thing on modern sites.  it isn't tenable.  i'd cite say bbc iplayer as an example that would probably seem just as broken if you've been messing with minimum font sizes
2014-02-01 16:28:46	pingu2	maybe even youtube
2014-02-01 16:29:03	ankh	youtube works fine
2014-02-01 16:29:13	ankh	bbc front page actually does have a problem
2014-02-01 16:29:25	ankh	but you can't assume you can get a font of any particular size in any case
2014-02-01 16:30:47	pingu2	i saw an interesting thing about web font subsets for bbc sites.  i guess they need to cater for a lot of different languages.  i wonder if i can find
2014-02-01 16:35:23	 *	ankh knows some of the bbc people
2014-02-01 16:36:44	pingu2	a guy in my other channel works for the bbc
2014-02-01 16:37:48	pingu2	and hey um, i'm not necessarily saying that sites like iplayer are any more correct in principle.  you have a point on font sizes.  just, it reaches a stage where um...  ubiquity becomes convention, if that's a good way to say it.  and more than that, some sites like youtubes and iplayer are so huge, that you almost just don't have 'the internet' without them
2014-02-01 16:38:35	pingu2	i guess i'm saying that if it's good enough for iplayer, it's good enough for me
2014-02-01 16:38:37	ankh	i'd rather lose youtube and the bbc altogether than lose accessibility and device independence
2014-02-01 16:39:25	pingu2	i'm struggling to imagine how i could keep an application like that pretty and usable without resorting to hidden overflow
2014-02-01 16:39:53	pingu2	there's some drag and drop stuff that depends on fixed proportions
2014-02-01 16:39:53	ankh	i'm not sure what the difficulty is
2014-02-01 16:40:43	pingu2	there's also an issue of inconsistency all around if fonts are forcing element sizing
2014-02-01 16:41:01	pingu2	it's an analogue to trying to lay out a page with line breaks
2014-02-01 16:41:09	pingu2	a classic no no really
2014-02-01 16:41:30	ankh	I should say it differently since I'm at least moderately familiar with CSS and Web design :)
2014-02-01 16:41:35	ankh	and typography.
2014-02-01 16:41:54	ankh	I'm even on the CSS Working Group for that matter
2014-02-01 16:42:14	pingu2	i knowww this.  and i'm no one to argue with you
2014-02-01 16:42:17	ankh	but you have to design for the medium, and the Web medium does not give you fixed font sizes.
2014-02-01 16:42:28	ankh	well, it doesn't make me always right :)
2014-02-01 16:42:32	pingu2	i do spend a huge amount of time building sites and helping others build theirs
2014-02-01 16:43:13	pingu2	same.  i'm always open to a change of view
2014-02-01 16:43:16	ankh	and yes, if someone has a 32px minimum font size, probably they will have to do a lot of scrolling
2014-02-01 16:44:49	ankh	(but then, being legally blind and having to use large text can be pretty sucky too, but that's no reason for things not to work)
2014-02-01 16:46:55	pingu2	i'll have a go at fixing next time i have the dev copy open.  it's starting to feel like a challenge
2014-02-01 16:47:52	ankh	yay :)
2014-02-01 16:48:46	ankh	it _can_ be hard, even using svg and jquery, and for me it's not optional really, even if i'm not perfect at it either ;0
2014-02-01 16:48:47	ankh	:-)
2014-02-01 16:57:13	pingu2	i can see svg becoming more and more prominent
2014-02-01 16:57:42	pingu2	this might be interesting (assuming jsfiddle works with a minimum font size) http://jsfiddle.net/wrH6m/
2014-02-01 16:58:56	ankh	penguin!
2014-02-01 16:59:01	ankh	wearing black socks!
2014-02-01 16:59:13	pingu2	it's an idea for placing icons on an svg sprite sheet that you might download once you're done.  something similar could probably be applied to font spacing
2014-02-01 16:59:37	edakiri	pingu2: what about not using a web browser for an application/program? It wasn't originally designed for it and it's not the best fit.
2014-02-01 17:00:19	ankh	edakiri, it's the way of the future (like it or not) I think
2014-02-01 17:00:29	pingu2	agree.  that's just the way things are since 2005 or so
2014-02-01 17:01:10	edakiri	As for WWW, it is designed to be able to use user font sizes and default colors. Complex documents can be made and styled and still be compatible with the user settings.
2014-02-01 17:01:32	pingu2	i'm what most people would call old school - get told i'm old and out of touch about 3 times a day
2014-02-01 17:02:10	ankh	well, the intent from the beginning was that users were in control of styles
2014-02-01 17:02:15	diogenese	That wouldn't bother me. I AM old and out of touch. Proud of it too. ;)
2014-02-01 17:02:31	edakiri	A tip: for font sizes, there is a new unit called rem in CSS. If you make sure all sizes are >=1rem, it shall be readable to the user.
2014-02-01 17:03:01	ankh	rem requires IE9 though
2014-02-01 17:03:03	ankh	or later
2014-02-01 17:03:19	ankh	and never worked in opera mini
2014-02-01 17:03:22	pingu2	i'd usually recommend unitless font sizes, other than for say buttons
2014-02-01 17:03:27	ankh	I don't know if shims like csspie can work arounf them
2014-02-01 17:04:16	edakiri	You can do it practically without rem, if you make sure that nothing specifies sizes 'less than'. only 'greater than' something else.
2014-02-01 17:05:28	ankh	"unitless font sizes" - do you mean, x-small etc?
2014-02-01 17:05:41	pingu2	no, just 1.2, 1.8, etc
2014-02-01 17:06:28	edakiri	Those have implied units. In CSS, AFAIR, default units are always pixels.
2014-02-01 17:06:39	ankh	yeah, I believe that's true
2014-02-01 17:06:55	ankh	CSS 2.1 does not give an exception for font-size at least
2014-02-01 17:07:27	pingu2	it's fractional, i think, with a difference from percentages where the latter get affected by the hierarchy
2014-02-01 17:08:17	edakiri	Other units are pt(point), which at least is somewhat relative to the user's DPI. Then there is 'em', which is relative. Maybe that is what you think of now.
2014-02-01 17:08:19	ankh	actually it might be em, based on 4.3.2 Lengths in CSS
2014-02-01 17:08:22	pingu2	am i mixing up font sizes with line heights?
2014-02-01 17:08:35	 *	pingu2 blush
2014-02-01 17:08:38	pingu2	i think i may be
2014-02-01 17:09:28	ankh	for line height, a number is multiplied by the font size, i.e. it's em
2014-02-01 17:10:00	ankh	http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height (see under <number>)
2014-02-01 17:10:30	ankh	and yes, using line heights in ems makes a lot of sense
2014-02-01 17:10:56	pingu2	this guy does quite a bit of research and has quite a following http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/line-height/
2014-02-01 17:15:27	edakiri	pingu2: FireFox supports multiple profiles, which is 1 way to use different settings for testing. You can have a test profile with larger and minimum font size and different colors. Try light foreground on dark background.
2014-02-01 17:16:37	edakiri	Within the same profile, you can use plugins ColorToggle and NoSquint, among others.
2014-02-01 17:17:09	ankh	yeah. i use a light text on a dark background theme, and quite a few sites give me black text on a black background in forms
2014-02-01 17:17:18	ankh	e.g. ebay's login page
2014-02-01 17:17:30	edakiri	I would use default colors of dark background and light foreground usually, if there weren't so many sites which have problems.
2014-02-01 17:17:55	ankh	it's been getting better, I've noticed
2014-02-01 17:18:02	pingu2	*to line heights, getting it right after some googling, i think unitless prevents descdendants picking up the computed value from the parent.  that is, if you set the parent line-height to em units, its children will have the same line-height regardless of their font size?
2014-02-01 17:18:26	ankh	pingu2, yes
2014-02-01 17:19:05	pingu2	kinda makes sense to set it without units then, i think.  perhaps a few less things to worry about
2014-02-01 17:21:25	ankh	in general text line height shouldn't be set much, and a typographer will not usually use the same factor for line height at different sizes, so it's less of a benefit than it might sound, but yes could reduce surprises
2014-02-01 17:22:15	pingu2	i'm still waiting to see if font-size-adjust might take off.  any thoughts?
2014-02-01 17:23:11	ankh	well, it was an interesting idea but i'm not sure how well supported it is
2014-02-01 17:24:34	pingu2	still only firefox I think.  i've probably linked this demo before http://fontcombiner.com/docs/fontscaling  might be interesting.  may not work with minimum sizes set
2014-02-01 17:26:02	edakiri	The idea of setting lower case size, could be good, but the way they implemented it seems like bad design of the property, at least in this example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust
2014-02-01 17:26:54	ankh	how do you mean, edakiri?
2014-02-01 17:26:57	edakiri	I was thinking, better would be to set it directly, rather than first set total line height then a factor.
2014-02-01 17:27:14	ankh	well, the font-size is needed for browsers that don't support font-size-adjust
2014-02-01 17:27:22	edakiri	Though the indirect way can be better for baackward compatability.
2014-02-01 17:27:30	ankh	we can't break the web :)
2014-02-01 17:27:32	edakiri	yes, i think that is why they chose that.
2014-02-01 17:28:24	pingu2	is that mdn page accurate?
2014-02-01 17:28:34	ankh	probably
2014-02-01 17:28:40	pingu2	"The font-size-adjust CSS property specifies that font size should be chosen based on the height of lowercase letters rather than the height of capital letters."
2014-02-01 17:28:42	edakiri	There are more font sizes to consider: size of chinese ideographs should be larger than others and also deserve a font size setting.
2014-02-01 17:28:45	ankh	and so is dave baron's commentary on it, linked to from the page
2014-02-01 17:29:12	pingu2	i question that mdn page.  not sure it's right
2014-02-01 17:29:20	edakiri	I wonder whether you can select language at least with a CSS selector.
2014-02-01 17:29:24	ankh	yes, there are proposals for that, edakiri, and i think they are implemented
2014-02-01 17:30:01	ankh	well, you'd need to have <span lang="zh-traditional">...</span> (or whatever the script name is for that, sorry, I forget)
2014-02-01 17:30:04	pingu2	maybe it's just a bit of an odd way to phrase it
2014-02-01 17:30:14	ankh	pingu2, what do yu think is wrong with it?

2014-02-02 04:12:06	edakiri	On unix, how can one combine multiple typefaces into a TTC?
2014-02-02 04:13:12	ankh	fonttools maybe, but if the fonts don't have compatible metrics it's not going to work well
2014-02-02 04:13:28	ankh	edakiri, you asked this yesterday but it wasn't clear to me why you wanted to do it
2014-02-02 04:15:41	edakiri	ankh: Are you sure?  Didn't I only ask about pulling glyphs from multiple typefaces into a new typeface?
2014-02-02 04:17:14	edakiri	I'm packaging a HTML based document with CSS and typeface files. If I could package all the typefaces into a single file, it would be nice.
2014-02-02 04:18:01	edakiri	I think there is a way to only include used glyphs. I may want to do that also.

2014-02-02 04:18:28	ankh	better to package the two fonts
2014-02-02 04:18:33	ankh	assuming the license allows it :D
2014-02-02 04:18:36	edakiri	It's going to be put on e-mail attachments, so I like to keep it small.
2014-02-02 04:18:45	ankh	then package subsets
2014-02-02 04:19:46	ankh	fonts have per-glyph, per-character and per-font metrics, and when you combine glyphs you need to watch all of them
2014-02-02 04:20:15	ankh	whereas a CSS/HTMl renderer will happily mix the fonts as characters are needed,, and will take the metrics into account
2014-02-02 04:20:30	ankh	the main reason to combine characters is to get kerning and ligature across them though
2014-02-02 04:20:56	edakiri	I think the license of most of the fonts I use are invalid anyways.
2014-02-02 04:21:21	edakiri	They are based on copyright and copyright is not applicable to fonts.
2014-02-02 04:21:47	edakiri	in the USA and Germany
2014-02-02 04:22:11	edakiri	I can delete the ligature combination tables to be safe. (for those typefaces)
2014-02-02 04:25:15	edakiri	"then package subsets" - was that meant to be "It is better to package the two fonts completely than to package subsets."?
2014-02-02 04:26:28	edakiri	So, the TTC does not support different per-font metrics in the collection? All fonts get the same metrics?
2014-02-02 04:30:38	edakiri	Hmmm. The typefaces have different metrics. Guess that wouldn't work so easily.

2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:44:38] adamw used to be very active in Mandriva at one point
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:45:06] he seems to've made the jump to Mageia, like most of us :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:49:56] Ankh: of course :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:50:25] (running mageia 4 here)

2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:52:13] I fondly respect AdamW as a community manager happy to see him follow the crowd :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:52:30] towards the end of Mandriva I filed a bug, "every time anyone installs Mandriva Linux, one of the developers gets laid off"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:52:51] Mageia and Mandriva inexpectandly found a way to work together :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:53:10] and there's a photo of the people who started mageia holding a card with that bug number crossed out as resolved fixed
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:53:23] Ankh: that was a long time ago :) (2 years at least)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:53:28] yes, adamw did a lot of good for mandriva
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:53:29] yes, it was
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[11:54:04] now mandriva seems to be striving well, and mageia too
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:56:35] I don't hear too much abut Mandriva these days though
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[11:56:56] http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity has Mageia at 4th place, Mandriva at 44th, but I don't really have any idea how accurate that might be :)

2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[21:47:04] I need to know everything there is about the technical aspects of computerized fonts. Is there a defacto book for this, like ANSI C or SICP are for their domains?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[23:50:12] "ANSI C" would be more like the documentation for one type of electronic fonts instead of all of them
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[01:31:31] JanC: OK. What do you mean when you say: "one type of electronic fonts"? Like truetype?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[01:36:51] something like that (although ANSI C is a lot less complicated as a topic)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[01:37:18] what I meant is that "electronic fonts" is a huge topic
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[01:38:40] it includes rasterized imaging, (several types of) vector-based imaging, virtual machines, etc.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[01:52:47] JanC: I do really want to learn much of it as it is the foundation for the software I've wanted to create for a long time now. I'm just reaching the levels of basic Computer Science and programming, that I can start to delve into this subject matter.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[01:54:36] So specifically: I really need to know how complex glyph rendering takes place with Truetype and OpenType fonts. There seems toe be several layers of abstraction here, as it is with most other aspects of computing and I would really like to understand how all the layers work together to correctly render the glyphs.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[05:29:53] http://fontforge.org/bibliography.html should be a good "literature list" for font-related standards & such
2014-02-05 19:45:52	baud	[05:39:31] JanC: perhaps fontconfig and source code for other font display code could be of use... (in KDE, gnome, postscript, NeXT...)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[05:40:26] fontconfig & freetype might be interesting to look into too, indeed
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[05:43:08] the O'Reilly book might be a good start...
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[07:37:24] iron_houzi, it might be best if you were more specific about what You wanted to do
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[07:37:57] and I'd add the harfbuzz shaper to JanC's list probably, and pango, although pango is higher level
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[07:38:25] the O'Reilly book on Fonts and Encodings is good except that its stuff on X11 is all about server-side fonts and not fontconfig
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:52:13] Ankh: What do you mean when you say "server-side fonts"?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:52:31] Do you mean server as in the Server client model in X11?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:54:07] I've done some more researching. I found that Microsoft and Adobe actually have some decent documentation on OpenType fonts, which I understand is a wrapper or superset of Truetype.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:55:29] The thing that I really, really want to know right now is about the Ligature Caret List Table: Is this a list of positions that a caret can have within a ligature?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:58:12] If so, is this _only_ defined for horizontal ligatures like fig 7c. here: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm, or can it also be set for vertical StackLigatures as seen in the last part of the demonstation of blws (Examples of Tibetan):http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm ?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[07:58:42] iron_houzi, hi
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:58:49] Hello
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[07:59:08] yes, the ORA section on X11 focuses on the bitmap fonts that the XServer supports and that's no longer used much
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[07:59:19] I see
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:00:24] https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ttrefman/rm06/Chap6lcar.html may help
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:01:37] I believe it's for an editor that uses a ^ or | to show the insertion point
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:01:58] truetype is actually the wrapper format
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:02:17] an opentype font is a truetype font with some extra truetype tables
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:02:31] OK
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:02:44] a truetype font can also contain 2 different formats for outlines - CFF (from Adobe Type 1) and TrueType from Apple and Microsoft
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:03:05] Yeah, I've understood that the lines can get a bit blurry..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:03:55] I don't think I'd say blurry particularly :) but complex maybe
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:04:04] OK
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:04:11] it's well defined
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:05:20] So, you don't know for certain if it's possible to define Ligature Caret position along the y-axis and not just along the x-axis?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:06:57] you didn't ask that :) although I actually don't offhand
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:07:04] the typofhile forum might help

2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:08:09] hey now, that's not very nice :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:08:49] :D
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:10:29] The forum seem like it's very non-technical though ... more focused on design and aesthetics.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:10:53] I don't know if you can include both x and y values at the same time in the gdef entry for the caret
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:12:03] the distance is normally taken to be in the direction of the text
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:12:58] well, if I knew more about your project I might be able to point you to more specific places, I don't even know if you're wearing shoes :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:13:42] OK. Where to begin ..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:14:06] (in other words, if it's a general interest question, you're learning, go to e.g. typofile, some well-respected font designers watch it and can answer; if it's about a specific project and it's likely to happen, maybe there are people who can help you in more detail)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:14:40] http://typophile.com/forum/6 might be the place to ask on typophile
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:14:41] It's for a specific project
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:15:09] I don't mean to be a gatekeeper, but rather to know how best to help you, where to send you
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:15:21] I'm not really interested in the design/aesthetics, but rather the programatic sides of typeface rendering.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:15:54] that's OK :) I got that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:16:22] I want to create a highly specialized piece of software for typing Tibetan and to do basic desktop publishing features.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:16:50] My problem is that all the frameworks aren't really designed for Tibetan.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:17:08] do you know Chris Fynn?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:17:25] https://sites.google.com/site/chrisfynn2/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:18:13] Linus Torvalds stated that every good programmer should build their software around the data. And all the current frameworks forces me to cram Tibetan into mold it doesn't really fit ..or so it seems, unless there's a way I haven't discovered yet.. the ligature caret positioning is quite central to this..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:18:35] Oh yeah. I've heard of him.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:18:48] Horrible font
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:19:09] aesthetically or technically?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:19:14] Technically
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:19:37] interesting, ok, what makes you say that? (not disagreeing, I'd like to know)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:20:06] I feel that everybody are trying to cram Tibetan text into a mold that it doesn't really suit. Perhaps I'm mistaken or naive, but this is my current drive..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:21:01] well, Chris is indeed not from Tibet
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:21:21] but I think you're implying that you feel font standards need to be changed?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:22:10] Perhaps not. Do you think it's possible to derive the positions of the subparts of a ligature?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:22:18] it's entirely possible, and if so, I'd like to see something written up about it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:22:30] well, "subparts" isn't always meaningful
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:22:53] I know.. my English is bad .. I'll try to make an image for you .. 2 minutes..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:22:57] you can use the caret table to point to a specific place on a glyph's contour
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:23:07] it's OK, so is my Norwegian :-)

2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:37:09] that's alright
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:37:15] http://imgur.com/dsihsMB
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:37:26] If you look at the image (sorry for the size)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:37:46] so the issue is that you're editing this and need the arrow keys to move you inside, or to be able to select part of the vertically-stacked glyoh
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:37:47] So I've tried to outline a ligature.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:38:03] Yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:38:24] in the first instance i'd say post it to that typophile forum
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:38:42] but, are you planning to write an editor?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[08:38:57] and, what happens today with Tibetan fonts?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	 *	Ankh [08:39:09] has to rush off for a few minutes to empty dogs, back in a bit
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:39:16] More like a word processor/simple desktop publishing application
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[08:39:21] OK.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:14:31] back
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:14:36] an open source one?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:27:14] Yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:27:42] Unfortunately, there are no good open source fonts.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:27:43] ok...
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:28:43] behdad might know the answer to your question if he's around or, more importantly, whether harfbuzz and/or pango and/or a tibetan pango module make available what you need to (say) a gtk+ program
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:28:45] Sorry, but what did you mean I should ask about at the typophile forum?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:29:22] how to encode the caret position in the y direction for the tibetan script
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:29:38] I think similar situations arise in Hindi and Farsi actually, but I am not certain
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:29:46] OK.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:29:47] or e.g. consider deleting a vowel in Hebrew
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:30:09] but you could also ask on the open sourc [create] mailing list
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:30:10] I thought they only used vowels for their training version of their scriptt
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:30:23] Hebrew, I mean
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:30:39] it doesn't matter if the cantillation is for training, they still do it :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:30:44] I've already posted something on the Pango mailing list.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:30:52] True
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:32:30] Are we talking about vertical caret positioning built into the ligature definitions in the fonts, or extracting the coordinates of the sub-characters of a ligature like in the image I linked to?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:32:52] it does not in general make sense to think of "sub-characters"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:33:13] I know. I feel it's bad as well. Do you have a better term I can use?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:34:05] it's not the term that's the problem really
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:34:34] Oh, what do you believe is the problem?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:35:11] it's the idea that a ligature glyph necessarily contains separable "sub-glyphs" for the characters that gave rise to the ligature
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:35:52] I understand. But do you think I can derive this information from the ligature somwhow?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:36:07] if you understood you wouldn't be asking the question :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:36:58] I call it optimism ..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:37:19] e.g. consider ß, the ss or sz ligature common in German and in older English texts
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:37:26] Yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:37:48] you can often see something shaped like a modern "s" to the right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:37:51] I didn't even know it was a ligature. I always thought it was a single character
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:37:54] which in German actually represents a z
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:37:59] OK
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:38:26] but in English and German also represents an s
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:38:30] if you upper-case it you get SS
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:39:03] but very few people today would want you to separate it into the vertical part on the left and the s-shaped part on the right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:39:25] because the vertical part doesn't (today) look like an s, and the s-like thing could be an s or z depending on context
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:39:39] similarly you can't easily separate out the e and t from &
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:40:02] (& isn't considered a ligature these days, any more than w, but it was once)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:41:30] Well. In the case of Tibetan, this doesn't apply at all. The ligature stuff is perhaps not a good way to represent Tibetan glyph stacks if they are fused into one big lump like that..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:41:43] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:41:43] But you made your point very well. THank you.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:42:29] Very interesting actually.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:43:37] i'm not familiar enough with Tibetan scripts to know what applies and what doesn't, but it might be that yes, you need to ask your question slightly differently so people used to other scripts can reply
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:44:10] I'd also urge you to get as far along with your software as possible so that you have (1) a name, and (2) something to show people and motivate them to help you
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:44:20] an open office plugin might be another thing to consider
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:44:48] But, I would really like to know what data is available to me. Some kind of coordinates must be present..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:45:35] I _think_ you get either (1) an x coordinate, or (2) a point on the glyph contour, or (3) a y coordinate
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:46:29] You're using OR as it's defined in boolean logic here?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:47:05] you only get one of them
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:47:11] OK
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:50:55] that's my understanding
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:51:09] *but* it might be possible to have two table entries for the same ligature, I don't know
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:52:40] and again, people like john hudson and gerry leonidas either monitor the typophile list or get told by someone else if osmething interesting is posted there
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:56:25] Wait! What about this: Since I know what characters are supposed to be in the vertical ligature, I should roughly be able to get the coordinates for the individual glyphs, right? Then I can rougly draw the selection and caret according to these coordinates. No?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:56:43] It wouldn't be pixel perfect, but it's much better than nothing.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:57:09] yeah
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:57:23] or see what happens if you supply both x and y coordinates in a font
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:57:30] I wish, I could hear the tone of your voice right now ..
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:57:51] Do you mean meeeybe .. kindof, but it's a horrible hack..?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:58:14] no
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:58:15] ..or absolutely! That might actually work!.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:58:20] :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:58:22] the latter
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[09:58:24] maybe the people at SIL can help too?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:58:25] OH!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:58:37] could be although I think they mostly know more about Graphite :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[09:58:47] true
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:58:52] What is SIL?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:59:09] and if a change *is* needed to the OpenType spec, it can always be changed
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:59:20] Summer Institute of Linguistics
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[09:59:43] Linguistics is fun.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[09:59:53] http://www.sil.org/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:00:05] they produced e.g. the Gentium font, and a font engine because they felt OpenType wasn't powerful enough for Devanagari (script used e.g. for Hindi and Sanskrit) although opinions actually differ on that one
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:00:09] they make their own fonts for foreign scripts
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:00:54] Wow! That is extremely interesting then. Tibetan is actually designed from Sanskrit.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:01:07] The Tibetan script that is.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:01:41] well, the Latn alphabet came from Phœnecian, supposedly, but the typesetting requirements are different :-) :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:02:31] Yeah. Kind of true for Tibetan and Devanagari also actually. The vowels are very similar though.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:04:08] Devanagari doesn't do the crazy vertical stacking that occurs in Tibetan. Especially in Tibetan translitteration of Sanskrit. Some Sanskrit words are extremely long and so when this is translitteratied to Tibetan, the stacks can grow quite tall.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:04:55] So is this Graphite standard incompatible with Open/Truetype?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:05:16] AFAIK it's an extension of it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:07:16] The graphite software seems to be all in Windows though. Is it open source?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:07:35] libgraphite is available in most distros
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:08:14] Oh great. Does Pango support it?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:08:45] the issue with devanagari is that some people say it needs glyph reordering for sequences of more than 5 glyphs
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:08:49] it can, using a plugin
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:09:00] firefox has some graphite support too
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:09:39] as has LibreOffice IIRC
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:10:20] I'm not sure about support on Windows/Mac OS X
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:11:35] Unfortunately. Those are the two that most people use.. I need cross platform compatibility with easy installation, if I am going to succeed.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:12:21] you said they have some Windows software on their site, it's just that I don't have either, so I can't really test them  :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:13:26] in any case, you should be able to use libgraphite in some way in your application
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:13:45] i'd say go with opentype if you can, and only use graphite if you really need to
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:13:56] although you could probably visit SIL
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:14:53] well, yeah, "standard" OpenType will/can work OOTB in all applications (at least in theory...)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:15:54] They have lots of interesting information on there. I'll make some images and see if I can try to ask some meaningful questions at the typophile forum. Thank you so much for all the help. I'll stick around and perhaps poke at you to pick your brains some more, when something comes up.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:16:07] ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[10:16:29] I'll see if I can find that O'Reilly book at my library as well.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:16:50] yeah, it may be of use.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:17:02] (ow, we are having gale-force winds here)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:18:10] we had a storm earlier today
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:20:38] including some ball lightnings entering houses & such  :-/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:27:26] ow ow ow
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:27:30] where areyou, JanC?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:28:16] Belgium (province of West-Flanders)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:28:21] ah ok
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:28:29] that's quite a storm
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:28:40] I think I've only been to Brussels and to Antwerp
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:28:57] do you come to FOSDEM?  :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:29:00] I liked Antwerp quite a bit, what I saw of it.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[10:29:01] no
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[10:30:15] I'm from Bruges
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[03:14:03] From what I can tell. Open/FreeType fonts have some lookup tables. This leads me to believe that there is some programming code stored somewhere in the font. Does Fontforge have any ability to let the user browse this code, or is there any other way to browse how the lookups are defined?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[04:55:20] iron_houzi: what do you exactly need to do?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[04:57:56] Please have a look at the bottom part of this document: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenTypeDev/tibetan/intro.htm - The first example in the section entitled "Examples of Tibetan: You will see that 3 or 4 Unicode codepoints are formed into one ligature, with the help of blws lookup StackLigatures. Something that is highly needed when dealing with the Tibetan script is to have ligature caret
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[04:57:59] definitions for all those 3-4 code points. Does the Freetype standard support this type of "vertical" ligature caret definitions?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[04:58:22] s/Freetype/Harfbuzz/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:05:54] iron_houzi: no.  1. OpenType standard currently doesn't support vertical ligature carets in a horizontal writing direction.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:06:10] 2. No platform using HarfBuzz supports ligature carets whatsoever.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[05:06:11] Noooo! I'm so sad.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:06:18] We plan on fixing both eventually....
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:06:49] iron_houzi: it's best to write to harfbuzz list for useful discussion.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:06:56] Not many people frequent here.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[05:06:58] behdad: I just realize who you are. You're the guy who does the GPU rendering of fonts. I saw your presentation. Very cool!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:07:08] And of course, it's good for posterity to have discussion in the archives.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:07:15] iron_houzi: lol.  yeah.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[05:09:39] I'm honoured to get to discuss this with you. What I am asking for here is quintessensial to my project. I'm a CS undergrad, just barely starting to get a handle on the basics .. I am thinking that perhaps I need to create my own renderer if I want this non-standard features. What are your thoughts on that?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:25:04] iron_houzi: You are definitely welcome to do such experiments, and I'm supportive of that.  You can definitely get started doing that by hacking harfbuzz and fonttools
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[05:25:14] gtg.  Write to harfbuzz list to keep discussion going?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[05:25:19] behdad: I've joined the mailing list. As I've already stated, I'm quite new to everythin. I'm halfway through my bachelor in CS, so I have a handle on coding in C. Is there any documentation on harfbuzz and fonttools?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	iron_houzi	[05:26:03] ..OK. I'll start something on the mailing list.

2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[23:21:09] I'm  trying to use fontmatrix to compare fonts for specific characters. How can I do that? or compare at all?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[23:21:30] The WWW site is in Japanese, if it is still the same. The program does not load documentation.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[23:23:47] I think I figured out how to compare single characters in a list it provides.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[23:25:06] Some sequences which can be rendered together (i forget the word) , like ffi, have their own code points? I didn't know that.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[23:44:43] kibogol: the word is 'ligature'
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[01:59:36] Is there a tool on GNU/Linux which can bundle a typeface which is in pfb files into otf?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[02:00:04] I have a typeface which has regular & bold pfb files, and want to bundle it into a single OTF file.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[02:36:39] Can multiple typefaces(families) be bundled into a single OTF file?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[02:37:10] I know its not conventional.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[02:48:13] Looking at my OTF files, all I see have different files for bold and italic variants. I'm not sure OTF can handle even packing them into the same file.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[03:15:04] kibogol: yes and no
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[03:15:19] kibogol: It's called TrueType Collection, or TTC
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[03:15:38] kibogol: it's technically only defined for TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, not PostScript/CFF-flavored ones.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	behdad	[03:15:42] But both work on Linux at least.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[03:17:03] Yucky specification!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	kibogol	[03:17:45] (that OTF would handle them so differently)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[03:41:15] it's TrueType Collection, not OpenType Collection  ;)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	JanC	[03:44:18] so I guess TTC & OTF are both "forks" of TTF, but nobody merged them (officially)

2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:37:13] oh. i guess that's more down to the software presenting the info.  i don't think there's anything in font technology itself to provide for that

2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:46:57] i have a tool here for combining manually http://fontcombiner.com/create
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:47:18] i'm not all that happy with the autospacing to be honest
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[15:47:32] pingu2: it's not there
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:47:41] you get an error?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[15:48:08] "We're very sorry, there was a problem"
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:48:25] http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/fontcombiner.com
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:48:46] try a refresh on the page?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[15:51:48] that won't help with anything automated anyway.  i guess if it's a one off, you could probably script something using either fontforge or ttxfonttools?  i imagine some sort of ttx | output | some other pipe magic might do it.  there's a can of worms when it comes to character spacing or kerning, though
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:02:44] pingu2: http://www.anonmgur.com/up/554925c1d734de584ce09cada3e0215e.png
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:02:54] oh gosh
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:03:05] what browser is that?!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:03:14] firefox/iceweasel
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:03:21] version number?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:03:29] 26.0
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:03:42] that's a little scary
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:04:50] this is probably the last thing a web coder should say, really, because it's a cop out, but i think your browser is broken
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:06:26] One of the real problems is that you don't use the users' size for text. You set another size.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:06:49] That causes the text out of bounds because I have a minimum text size set to counter bad web design.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:08:04] that's necessary when dealing with buttons, i think, really.  you can't place every button in an application with a changeable size
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:08:56] Yes, you can. They can flow.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:09:05] i guess you could set everything to overflow hidden
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:09:42] I wasn't talking about overflow, I meant that the buttons don't need to be in a fixed position, just as a word does not.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:10:18] That and relative positioning can be used for most anything.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:10:49] But trying to do this kind of thing in a web browser is trying to use the wrong tool, IMO.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:11:08] you are actually talking about a custom stylesheet that breaks the website.  i can't cater for that, not really.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:11:16] --if you want many buttons and complex UI.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:12:12] I'm using the usual facilities, plus minimum font size enforcement. I can cater to it. I don't know why you can't.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:12:41] no one does that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:12:59] either sets minium font sizes or tries to cater for people who do
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:13:32] Hobbyists 15 years ago did a better job. No reason to accept less now.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:14:31] Everything should work with the users colors and font settings.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:15:19] I don't mean use the user's default colors for everything, but work regardless of them.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:16:59] sounds a bit illogical to me.  you're forcing the browser to use a styles other than those provided by the site, and other than the defaults for the agent.  there is no way to compensate for that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:17:03]  a lot of people set minimum font sizes in their browsers. I do too.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:17:22] why not just zoom in?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:17:28] pingu2, it's actally fundamental to the design of CSS that users can override the browser's default stylesheet
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:17:49] zooming in typically requires horizontal scrolling (although I do zoom in a lot)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:17:54] The colors I have set are default web ones. It is only the effect of minimum font size which you notice in that image.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:18:13] i think you're right, yep.  hopefully that's all it is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:27:56] still, you can't allow for that sort of thing on modern sites.  it isn't tenable.  i'd cite say bbc iplayer as an example that would probably seem just as broken if you've been messing with minimum font sizes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:28:46] maybe even youtube
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:29:03] youtube works fine
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:29:13] bbc front page actually does have a problem
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:29:25] but you can't assume you can get a font of any particular size in any case
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:30:47] i saw an interesting thing about web font subsets for bbc sites.  i guess they need to cater for a lot of different languages.  i wonder if i can find
2014-02-05 19:45:52	 *	ankh [16:35:23] knows some of the bbc people
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:36:44] a guy in my other channel works for the bbc
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:37:48] and hey um, i'm not necessarily saying that sites like iplayer are any more correct in principle.  you have a point on font sizes.  just, it reaches a stage where um...  ubiquity becomes convention, if that's a good way to say it.  and more than that, some sites like youtubes and iplayer are so huge, that you almost just don't have 'the internet' without them
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:38:35] i guess i'm saying that if it's good enough for iplayer, it's good enough for me
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:38:37] i'd rather lose youtube and the bbc altogether than lose accessibility and device independence
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:39:25] i'm struggling to imagine how i could keep an application like that pretty and usable without resorting to hidden overflow
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:39:53] there's some drag and drop stuff that depends on fixed proportions
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:39:53] i'm not sure what the difficulty is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:40:43] there's also an issue of inconsistency all around if fonts are forcing element sizing
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:41:01] it's an analogue to trying to lay out a page with line breaks
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:41:09] a classic no no really
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:41:30] I should say it differently since I'm at least moderately familiar with CSS and Web design :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:41:35] and typography.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:41:54] I'm even on the CSS Working Group for that matter
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:42:14] i knowww this.  and i'm no one to argue with you
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:42:17] but you have to design for the medium, and the Web medium does not give you fixed font sizes.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:42:28] well, it doesn't make me always right :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:42:32] i do spend a huge amount of time building sites and helping others build theirs
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:43:13] same.  i'm always open to a change of view
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:43:16] and yes, if someone has a 32px minimum font size, probably they will have to do a lot of scrolling
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:44:49] (but then, being legally blind and having to use large text can be pretty sucky too, but that's no reason for things not to work)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:46:55] i'll have a go at fixing next time i have the dev copy open.  it's starting to feel like a challenge
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:47:52] yay :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:48:46] it _can_ be hard, even using svg and jquery, and for me it's not optional really, even if i'm not perfect at it either ;0
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:48:47] :-)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:57:13] i can see svg becoming more and more prominent
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:57:42] this might be interesting (assuming jsfiddle works with a minimum font size) http://jsfiddle.net/wrH6m/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:58:56] penguin!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[16:59:01] wearing black socks!
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[16:59:13] it's an idea for placing icons on an svg sprite sheet that you might download once you're done.  something similar could probably be applied to font spacing
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[16:59:37] pingu2: what about not using a web browser for an application/program? It wasn't originally designed for it and it's not the best fit.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:00:19] edakiri, it's the way of the future (like it or not) I think
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:00:29] agree.  that's just the way things are since 2005 or so
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:01:10] As for WWW, it is designed to be able to use user font sizes and default colors. Complex documents can be made and styled and still be compatible with the user settings.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:01:32] i'm what most people would call old school - get told i'm old and out of touch about 3 times a day
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:02:10] well, the intent from the beginning was that users were in control of styles
2014-02-05 19:45:52	diogenese	[17:02:15] That wouldn't bother me. I AM old and out of touch. Proud of it too. ;)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:02:31] A tip: for font sizes, there is a new unit called rem in CSS. If you make sure all sizes are >=1rem, it shall be readable to the user.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:03:01] rem requires IE9 though
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:03:03] or later
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:03:19] and never worked in opera mini
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:03:22] i'd usually recommend unitless font sizes, other than for say buttons
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:03:27] I don't know if shims like csspie can work arounf them
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:04:16] You can do it practically without rem, if you make sure that nothing specifies sizes 'less than'. only 'greater than' something else.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:05:28] "unitless font sizes" - do you mean, x-small etc?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:05:41] no, just 1.2, 1.8, etc
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:06:28] Those have implied units. In CSS, AFAIR, default units are always pixels.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:06:39] yeah, I believe that's true
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:06:55] CSS 2.1 does not give an exception for font-size at least
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:07:27] it's fractional, i think, with a difference from percentages where the latter get affected by the hierarchy
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:08:17] Other units are pt(point), which at least is somewhat relative to the user's DPI. Then there is 'em', which is relative. Maybe that is what you think of now.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:08:19] actually it might be em, based on 4.3.2 Lengths in CSS
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:08:22] am i mixing up font sizes with line heights?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	 *	pingu2 [17:08:35] blush
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:08:38] i think i may be
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:09:28] for line height, a number is multiplied by the font size, i.e. it's em
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:10:00] http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-line-height (see under <number>)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:10:30] and yes, using line heights in ems makes a lot of sense
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:10:56] this guy does quite a bit of research and has quite a following http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/line-height/
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:15:27] pingu2: FireFox supports multiple profiles, which is 1 way to use different settings for testing. You can have a test profile with larger and minimum font size and different colors. Try light foreground on dark background.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:16:37] Within the same profile, you can use plugins ColorToggle and NoSquint, among others.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:17:09] yeah. i use a light text on a dark background theme, and quite a few sites give me black text on a black background in forms
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:17:18] e.g. ebay's login page
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:17:30] I would use default colors of dark background and light foreground usually, if there weren't so many sites which have problems.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:17:55] it's been getting better, I've noticed
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:18:02] *to line heights, getting it right after some googling, i think unitless prevents descdendants picking up the computed value from the parent.  that is, if you set the parent line-height to em units, its children will have the same line-height regardless of their font size?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:18:26] pingu2, yes
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:19:05] kinda makes sense to set it without units then, i think.  perhaps a few less things to worry about
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:21:25] in general text line height shouldn't be set much, and a typographer will not usually use the same factor for line height at different sizes, so it's less of a benefit than it might sound, but yes could reduce surprises
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:22:15] i'm still waiting to see if font-size-adjust might take off.  any thoughts?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:23:11] well, it was an interesting idea but i'm not sure how well supported it is
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:24:34] still only firefox I think.  i've probably linked this demo before http://fontcombiner.com/docs/fontscaling  might be interesting.  may not work with minimum sizes set
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:26:02] The idea of setting lower case size, could be good, but the way they implemented it seems like bad design of the property, at least in this example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:26:54] how do you mean, edakiri?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:26:57] I was thinking, better would be to set it directly, rather than first set total line height then a factor.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:27:14] well, the font-size is needed for browsers that don't support font-size-adjust
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:27:22] Though the indirect way can be better for baackward compatability.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:27:30] we can't break the web :)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:27:32] yes, i think that is why they chose that.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:28:24] is that mdn page accurate?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:28:34] probably
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:28:40] "The font-size-adjust CSS property specifies that font size should be chosen based on the height of lowercase letters rather than the height of capital letters."
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:28:42] There are more font sizes to consider: size of chinese ideographs should be larger than others and also deserve a font size setting.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:28:45] and so is dave baron's commentary on it, linked to from the page
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:29:12] i question that mdn page.  not sure it's right
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[17:29:20] I wonder whether you can select language at least with a CSS selector.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:29:24] yes, there are proposals for that, edakiri, and i think they are implemented
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:30:01] well, you'd need to have <span lang="zh-traditional">...</span> (or whatever the script name is for that, sorry, I forget)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:30:04] maybe it's just a bit of an odd way to phrase it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:30:14] pingu2, what do yu think is wrong with it?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:30:33] well, it means the x-height and is trying to avoid using that jargon
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:30:43] it's a way to adjust font sizes by setting a fraction according to x-height, yep
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:31:13] 'rather than the height of capital letters'.  don't know about that
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:31:59] which part is confusing?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	 *	ankh [17:32:37] publishes image of the day on fromoldbooks.org - an initial letter T.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:33:37] (which i hope works ok with large fonts!)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:33:54] to me the first sentence implies that it's a way to set font sizes based on lower case letters
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:34:10] well, based on the size of lower case letters
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:34:42] oh, "rather than the height of capital letters" is in error
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:34:56] i see now
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:35:57] although it's trying to simplify and avoid jargon, lies-told-to-children and all that.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:35:59] it may just be me needing to read it three times - far as implications of its use
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[17:36:57] ok, i'm off, 4:30am
2014-02-05 19:45:52	pingu2	[17:37:19] time zones.  9:30 here.  ok.  bye
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[18:25:33] ankh: I like the color scheme from fromoldbooks.org .  The hue & brightness contrast on the choices at top is low for me.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[19:55:19] FontForge has a 'merge fonts' feature under 'Elements', but it seems not to import all glyphs. I don't understand.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[20:22:43] The reason was that one font had some emptiness for a glyph rather than nothing.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:12:06] On unix, how can one combine multiple typefaces into a TTC?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:13:12] fonttools maybe, but if the fonts don't have compatible metrics it's not going to work well
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:13:28] edakiri, you asked this yesterday but it wasn't clear to me why you wanted to do it
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:15:41] ankh: Are you sure?  Didn't I only ask about pulling glyphs from multiple typefaces into a new typeface?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:17:14] I'm packaging a HTML based document with CSS and typeface files. If I could package all the typefaces into a single file, it would be nice.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:18:01] I think there is a way to only include used glyphs. I may want to do that also.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:18:28] better to package the two fonts
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:18:33] assuming the license allows it :D
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:18:36] It's going to be put on e-mail attachments, so I like to keep it small.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:18:45] then package subsets
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:19:46] fonts have per-glyph, per-character and per-font metrics, and when you combine glyphs you need to watch all of them
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:20:15] whereas a CSS/HTMl renderer will happily mix the fonts as characters are needed,, and will take the metrics into account
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[04:20:30] the main reason to combine characters is to get kerning and ligature across them though
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:20:56] I think the license of most of the fonts I use are invalid anyways.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:21:21] They are based on copyright and copyright is not applicable to fonts.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:21:47] in the USA and Germany
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:22:11] I can delete the ligature combination tables to be safe. (for those typefaces)
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:25:15] "then package subsets" - was that meant to be "It is better to package the two fonts completely than to package subsets."?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:26:28] So, the TTC does not support different per-font metrics in the collection? All fonts get the same metrics?
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[04:30:38] Hmmm. The typefaces have different metrics. Guess that wouldn't work so easily.
2014-02-05 19:45:52	edakiri	[05:04:07] Aha. http://fontforge.org/generate.html#GenerateTTC
2014-02-05 19:45:52	Ankh	[09:53:58] typeface designs are protected in Germany since 1981

2014-02-05 21:14:52	RoelN	well, I'm using fontforge in python (in a tool called fontcustom) and it generates a TTF font which is quite large... When I inspect it, I see a lot of data in the glyf table <instructions><assembly></assembly></instructions>
2014-02-05 21:15:09	RoelN	I removed this and the resulting TTF is a lot smaller
2014-02-05 21:15:38	RoelN	but I can't find anything about this data — I want to google how I can tell fontforge not to create/include this data
2014-02-05 21:15:42	RoelN	any suggestions?
2014-02-05 21:16:12	behdad	RoelN: Those are TrueType hinting instructions.
2014-02-05 21:16:26	behdad	Look for a way to drop hinting instructions in FontForge.  I'm sure it has that.
2014-02-05 21:19:18	RoelN	behdad: oh, but that doesn't sound like something I'd want to trash, right?
2014-02-05 21:19:46	RoelN	I'm still a bit wet behind the ears as far as fonts go, so that might be a stupid question
2014-02-05 21:24:37	behdad	RoelN: What do you mean by "a lot smaller"?
2014-02-05 21:24:54	RoelN	I mean the filesize
2014-02-05 21:26:01	RoelN	I use TTX/FontTools to export the TTF to a XML, then I removed those assembly-nodes, and changed the XML back to a TTF
2014-02-05 21:26:13	RoelN	and that file is then a lot smaller, but otherwise still the same as the original versiob
2014-02-05 21:26:18	RoelN	*version

2014-02-05 21:34:44	behdad	RoelN: I know.  I was asking, when you say a lot smaller, how much smaller do you mean?  Say, in percentages.
2014-02-05 21:35:43	RoelN	behdad: my original font (four glyps) was 6276 bytes... After the clean-up, the resulting font is 2144 bytes
2014-02-05 21:35:58	RoelN	so I guess a 60-70% gain!
2014-02-05 21:36:03	behdad	RoelN: you may get smaller too, if you try.
2014-02-05 21:36:04	RoelN	or loss, actually ;)
2014-02-05 21:36:20	behdad	RoelN: depends on your usecase.  you can drop hinting for many valid uses.
2014-02-05 21:36:56	RoelN	behdad: isn't hinting quite vital for digital type?
2014-02-05 21:37:28	behdad	RoelN: As I said, depends on what you want to do.  If you care about the rendering on Windows, you may need hinting.
2014-02-05 21:37:40	behdad	RoelN: But for a four-glyph font, I imagine you have other uses?
2014-02-05 21:56:31	RoelN	behdad: yes, it is a custom icon font
2014-02-05 21:57:18	RoelN	I normally use an online tool called Icomoon.io, and after inspecting their results I see they don't gave this assembly data too
2014-02-05 21:58:03	RoelN	and their fonts are used a lot on Windows systems, and I never read complains about hinting, nor have I seen it myself — but my untrained eye could be blamed for that
2014-02-05 22:09:47	behdad	RoelN: For icon fonts you don't really want hinting to begin with.
2014-02-05 22:12:10	RoelN	behdad: why not? I figure it brings the same advantages as for type, doesn't it?
2014-02-05 22:15:58	behdad	RoelN: Type is perceived very differently by people than graphics.
2014-02-05 22:16:08	behdad	Anyway, doesn't really matter for your usecase IMO.
2014-02-05 22:16:43	RoelN	behdad: looks like you're right, as those other icon services don't bother with it either

2014-02-06 03:31:55	RoelN	I've been googling a bit about this, it appears hinting does really improve EOT fonts, used by Internet Explorer 8 and before, typically on Windows XP
2014-02-06 03:33:28	RoelN	there appears to be some consensus about hinting not being very noticable for modern browsers, so it seems to be used for older browsers
2014-02-06 04:16:43	Ankh	RoelN, hi
2014-02-06 04:16:54	RoelN	hey Ankh
2014-02-06 04:16:58	Ankh	hinting is most effective at under an effective resolution of 150ppem or so
2014-02-06 04:17:08	Ankh	(device pixels per em, not CSS pixels)
2014-02-06 04:17:52	Ankh	a lot of Web designers are using Macs with "retina" displays at over 150ppi, so basic stem hinting is not needed
2014-02-06 04:18:13	Ankh	however, a lot of *users* have systems with 96 ppi or so screens
2014-02-06 04:18:43	Ankh	with sub-pixel rendering enabled (cleartype) and a large enough font size, and a big enough distance from the screen, hitning again is not as important
2014-02-06 04:19:10	Ankh	but if someone is using a 'phone or a tablet or a laptop or a computer older than, say, 5 minutes :), it'll make a noticeable difference
2014-02-06 04:19:42	Ankh	hinting makes a noticeable difference on a 300dpi laser printer, a smaller difference at 600dpi, and little or no perceptible difference at 1200dpi
2014-02-06 04:20:11	Ankh	Avi Naiman did his thesis on hinting in about 1989 or so, that would be a good starting point
2014-02-06 04:20:47	RoelN	interesting — so you say for today's practical use, hinting *is* relevant for icons?
2014-02-06 04:20:52	RoelN	because I get this feeling it
2014-02-06 04:21:30	Ankh	icons, hmm
2014-02-06 04:21:33	RoelN	because I get this feeling it *does* improve appearance, but not that much — unless you're on an old system
2014-02-06 04:21:51	RoelN	Ankh: yes, this specific case is about icons :)
2014-02-06 04:22:00	Ankh	in an icon font I take it
2014-02-06 04:22:07	RoelN	yes indeed
2014-02-06 04:22:29	Ankh	the hints are to make e.g. vertical stems of "m" the same width as each other, and "n" and "m" the same height
2014-02-06 04:22:44	Ankh	so I can see how some icons could make use of that
2014-02-06 04:22:45	RoelN	one of the biggest online tools for this, icomoon.io, only hints the EOT files (for IE8 and older), and for all the others there's no hinting
2014-02-06 04:23:34	Ankh	if they will make hinted truetype or opentype you could generate woff format yourself
2014-02-06 04:24:40	RoelN	looking at the toolset that's what happens: generate TTF -> autohint -> generate WOFF and EOT from that
2014-02-06 04:25:56	Ankh	font-tools on Linux might be able to open an EOT file and convert it to hinted woff, I don't know
2014-02-06 04:26:01	 *	Ankh off to shovel snow
2014-02-06 04:27:45	RoelN	Ankh: the other way around: these tools create a (hinted) TTF and the EOT and WOFF from that
2014-02-06 04:28:15	RoelN	thanks for your insights by the way, I'm new to this but I'm loving all this & want to learn a lot more about it

2014-02-06 05:19:58	behdad	Ankh: So, believe it or not.  One day I borrowed Avi's dissertation from the grad lounge to read.
2014-02-06 05:20:09	behdad	It's within my hand's reach right now!
2014-02-06 05:20:19	behdad	That's more about antialiasing than hinting though.
2014-02-06 05:20:55	RoelN	I just published my little blog post about font icons, for if you want to know more about the context in which I asked these questions: http://www.pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-icons/
2014-02-06 05:23:16	behdad	That's quite some serious font / text abuse.
2014-02-06 05:24:09	RoelN	it... well, yes, it is
2014-02-06 05:24:12	behdad	RoelN: There's some prior art there, in case you don't know:
2014-02-06 05:24:28	behdad	http://lwn.net/Articles/497233/
2014-02-06 05:24:52	behdad	RoelN: also, the Microsoft color font proposal (which is in Windows 8.1) is very similar to your approach, but contained within a font.
2014-02-06 05:25:59	RoelN	behdad: thanks for the link! I know some of the things they mention there (at a quick glance), but colorfont.js relies on JavaScript, whereas my little hack works with pure CSS
2014-02-06 05:26:07	RoelN	but the principle is the same
2014-02-06 05:30:40	behdad	RoelN: Ankh can tell you why what you're doing is very bad ;).
2014-02-06 05:32:19	RoelN	haha, I'm all ears!
2014-02-06 05:38:32	 *	Ankh reads,  The asked the "Where did and fly off to?"
2014-02-06 05:38:57	Ankh	and that's what the Google and Microsoft web crawlers for search will read too of course
2014-02-06 05:39:10	Ankh	please don't do this.
2014-02-06 05:39:15	behdad	:)
2014-02-06 05:39:24	behdad	Agreed.  That's what SVG is for
2014-02-06 05:39:32	Ankh	(I was using the "lynx" Web browser if you're wondering)
2014-02-06 05:40:12	behdad	Hah!  I was expecting *that*!
2014-02-06 05:40:26	Ankh	SVg multicolor font support is on its way - in the meantime use SVG icons or use the img element with alt text (img/@alt is a really bad design but it's massively better than this)
2014-02-06 05:41:01	Ankh	well, lynx is an easy way for people to get an idea of what a web crawler or indexer might see - google webmaster tools includes a way to see the google index bot view of your page too

2014-02-11 01:41:37	RoelN	Does anybody know the answer to this: https://twitter.com/pixelambacht/status/432930689030160384 --> IE4 had @font-face support in 1997 (!) Granted: EOT, but still. Why didn't it pick up, esp. in a time where IE4 was omnipresent? Licensing?
2014-02-11 01:44:04	JanC	it was used on intranets
2014-02-11 01:45:15	JanC	and IIRC Netscape had its own competing font format at some point (probably licensed from Bitstream?)
2014-02-11 01:46:04	JanC	plus, there wee several other browsers back in those days
2014-02-11 01:46:07	JanC	were
2014-02-11 01:47:08	RoelN	yeah, but IE4 was huge (and otherwise IE5, 5.5 and 6 were) so I wonder why it was hardly ever used — as far as I remember that is
2014-02-11 01:47:13	JanC	also, it probably wasn't supported in IE for Mac and IE for UNIX
2014-02-11 01:47:56	JanC	also remember that back in 1997 internet used to be very slow for most people
2014-02-11 01:48:20	JanC	so downloading fonts for every website wasn't exactly popular  ;-)
2014-02-11 01:49:11	JanC	those were the days when loading a front page in less than 10 seconds was a hard to reach goal  :)
2014-02-11 01:50:09	RoelN	definitely trye, JanC! But still, do you think those were the actual reasons? I mean we had 30K JPG files back then, so why no 30K EOT?
2014-02-11 01:50:34	JanC	30k JPGs?
2014-02-11 01:51:11	JanC	my boss would have sacked me for that unless they were really necessary ;)
2014-02-11 01:51:50	JanC	and that was in 2000
2014-02-11 01:53:02	JanC	well, not sacked, but he would have complained about slow loading pages
2014-02-11 01:53:59	RoelN	but still — for 12 years, hardly any website used @font-face at all, untill Safar, FF, Opera etc started supporting it
2014-02-11 01:54:10	RoelN	that's not because of a 30K download ;)

2014-02-11 01:55:36	JanC	like I said: it only worked in IE for Windows, and only with EOT, and IIRC you had to re-create the EOT after every change to your website  :)
2014-02-11 01:56:13	JanC	at least in theory, you were supposed to only include the glyphs that you actually used
2014-02-11 01:58:03	JanC	also: Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc. didn't support EOT
2014-02-11 01:58:55	Ankh_	some sites used the PFR fonts from netscape, but because it was proprietary ,mozilla/firefox didn't support that either
2014-02-11 01:59:09	Ankh_	cross-platform has always been a big part of the Web
2014-02-11 01:59:26	JanC	PFR was from Bitstream IIRC, and supported by Netscape
2014-02-11 01:59:32	Ankh_	yes

2014-02-11 02:01:10	JanC	I'm pretty sure it was a combination of incompatible standards, download size (at least in the early days), the lack of easy tools and maybe some more
2014-02-11 02:03:00	RoelN	JanC: I never said those browsers supported EOT ;)
2014-02-11 02:03:43	JanC	RoelN: you didn't, just pointing out that's a reason to not use it on your site  :)
2014-02-11 02:03:52	JanC	back in those years
2014-02-11 02:03:55	RoelN	but cross-platform wasn't such a big deal back in 1997-2000, that's where the whole problem of people designing specifically for IE came from ("This website is best viewed in IE" — aargh!)
2014-02-11 02:04:16	JanC	some of those sites also used EOT
2014-02-11 02:04:16	ankh	RoelN, i don't know that i'd say that about cross-platform work
2014-02-11 02:04:52	JanC	but it was all more common on intranets
2014-02-11 02:05:13	ankh	there were IE-only sites, but EOT was moer likely to come from professionally designed sites with some typographic knowledge, and they cared more about cross-platform, cross-device
2014-02-11 02:05:29	ankh	at any rate font-face is taking off fast today.
2014-02-11 02:05:31	RoelN	hmm, that might be true
2014-02-11 02:06:02	ankh	another issue was that a lot of commercial fonts had licences that forbade use with EOT
2014-02-11 02:06:19	ankh	when we made WOFF we got buy-in from the type makers and sellers
2014-02-11 02:06:26	RoelN	also, these weren't hard facts but just personal experiences... now that @font-face is so widely available, it's weird to think that I didn't know about it back in 1998, when I was also making websites — even if it would've only been useful for IE4/5
2014-02-11 02:06:26	 *	JanC remembers helping to kick up a shitstorm about IE-only government sites  :)
2014-02-11 02:08:08	JanC	ankh: right, the only fonts which allowed that were installed by default on almost all Windows systems anyway  :)
2014-02-11 02:08:27	JanC	the only free fonts
2014-02-11 02:09:41	JanC	and for an EOT license you often had to pay extra for commercial fonts
2014-02-11 02:10:23	JanC	so, I guess it was really too early and the market wasn't ready for it  :)
2014-02-11 02:12:04	JanC	and even now there are still issues with custom fonts, it seems
2014-02-11 02:12:47	JanC	(e.g. it seems like Chrome/Chromium don't load custom fonts when a tab is loaded in the background?)
2014-02-11 02:13:17	ankh	the font loading api will help with that
2014-02-11 02:13:45	ankh	so improvements are still happening
2014-02-11 02:13:59	ankh	google's font service is helping to reduce the bandwidth problem, too
2014-02-11 02:14:17	ankh	(since other sites may have the same font, it'll be in the browser cache)
2014-02-11 02:16:01	JanC	assuming you want to use Google font services and compromise your user's privacy  ;)
2014-02-11 02:29:04	ankh	yes
2014-02-11 02:29:34	ankh	the google analytics code and the jquery cdn does that already :)

2014-02-24 00:35:17	JanC	oleo: it *is* a bitmap font, so what do you expect it to look like?
2014-02-24 02:47:12	oleo	no i meant if there was some porting to non bitmap was done....
2014-02-24 02:57:15	JanC	there is a "vector" port, but it just describes the pixels by means of vectors
2014-02-24 02:57:57	JanC	(every pixel is a rectangle)
2014-02-24 02:59:14	JanC	I don't think GNU Unifont would be the best source for a vector Unicode font
2014-02-24 03:00:03	oleo	i only meant because it covers the widest range it seems....
2014-02-24 03:00:41	oleo	no other font i tried passes the test from the ucs-fonts.tar.gz packages
2014-02-24 03:00:47	oleo	s/test/tests/
2014-02-24 03:01:00	JanC	maybe for open fonts, DejaVu is the getting closest
2014-02-24 03:01:05	oleo	jep
2014-02-24 03:01:16	oleo	dejavu sans is pretty good
2014-02-24 03:01:52	JanC	so improving that is going to be the best thing
2014-02-24 03:02:10	oleo	well if i knew howto edit fonts....
2014-02-24 03:02:10	oleo	lol
2014-02-24 03:02:19	oleo	i'd do it really....
2014-02-24 03:02:33	oleo	i know the font editors.....
2014-02-24 03:02:53	oleo	but doing it is a no-go at the moment for me.....
2014-02-24 03:03:46	JanC	I assume the glyphs you use yourself are supported anyway?
2014-02-24 03:03:53	JanC	the "alphabets"
2014-02-24 03:04:08	oleo	yes
2014-02-24 03:04:28	JanC	that's the issue with most such fonts  :)
2014-02-24 03:05:03	JanC	the less people need it, the harder to get people to contribute glyphs, etc.
2014-02-24 03:05:40	oleo	it's said one can rely on the multiplexing behaviour on some servers and apps...but that seems to be not the case here over....
2014-02-24 03:05:54	oleo	maybe on the newer X'en or so....

2014-02-26 04:03:17	JanC	pabs3: haha, sometimes solutions are obvious but unexpected  :)
2014-02-26 04:11:02	oleo	i didn't get the conversation.....but happy if it makes stuff work.....
2014-02-26 04:14:36	JanC	<pabs3> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21947452/why-is-printing-b-dramatically-slower-than-printing
2014-02-26 04:14:40	JanC	oleo: ^^^
2014-02-26 04:19:45	oleo	ja
2014-02-26 04:19:58	oleo	B can be interpreted as a command in the shell for example....
2014-02-26 04:20:24	JanC	well, it was printing to the terminal, not inserting commands
2014-02-26 04:20:37	JanC	(and # can be a command too)
2014-02-26 04:21:04	oleo	# itself evaluates to a newline...
2014-02-26 04:21:32	JanC	depending on your shell...
2014-02-26 04:21:33	oleo	or rather it's effect is like newline say.... at least for bash.....
2014-02-26 04:21:49	oleo	but as you said you print it.....ya you right....
2014-02-26 04:21:52	JanC	a POSIX shell will see it as the start of a comment
2014-02-26 04:22:02	oleo	jep
2014-02-26 04:22:08	JanC	so basicaly a no-op
2014-02-26 04:22:16	oleo	yes
2014-02-26 04:23:28	oleo	can't say what print in your prog lang is supposed to do....if it's reaching it verbatim or so....
2014-02-26 04:23:37	oleo	it's java it seems....
2014-02-26 04:23:49	oleo	well i don't use java often....
2014-02-26 04:25:19	JanC	Java or C# or whatever
2014-02-26 04:25:44	JanC	some verbose language :)
2014-02-26 04:26:52	JanC	Netbeans seems to point to Java
2014-02-26 04:27:01	oleo	yes
2014-02-26 04:27:21	oleo	netbeans is nifty but my pc is slow with it....
2014-02-26 04:27:28	oleo	and it's fonts were not ok.....
2014-02-26 04:27:46	oleo	i rather use emacs and stuf.....
2014-02-26 04:28:02	oleo	common-lisp rather....
2014-02-26 04:29:34	oleo	it maybe that i was low on ram maybe....
2014-02-26 04:30:12	JanC	I've never written any LISP(-alike), but I know more or less how it works  :)
2014-02-26 04:30:51	JanC	and AFAIK Netbeans is (was?) slightly better at memory usage than Eclipse
2014-02-26 04:31:05	JanC	but that's probably not a good reference  ;-)
2014-02-26 04:31:08	oleo	jep Eclipse was even slower.....
2014-02-26 04:31:59	JanC	Eclipse is a lot like emacs in many ways...
2014-02-26 04:32:01	oleo	the package library was not so good....would hang many times....
2014-02-26 04:32:32	oleo	otherwise refactoring stuff and plugins etc..was nifty....
2014-02-26 04:32:56	JanC	the core + plugins/extensions/whatever idea
2014-02-26 04:32:56	oleo	anyway i just experimented a few times and gave up....
2014-02-26 04:33:01	oleo	too complex for me......
2014-02-26 04:33:18	oleo	and i don't even know if i'd need this or that library....
2014-02-26 04:33:26	JanC	which then grows to include a mail client  :)
2014-02-26 04:33:39	oleo	ah yes saw that one
2014-02-26 04:33:49	oleo	you could directly mail the devs
2014-02-26 04:34:00	JanC	(IBM Notes being a mail client based on Eclipse)
2014-02-26 04:38:46	oleo	so you were more or less trying to figure out some control flow issue above.....
2014-02-26 04:38:48	oleo	that requiring to know what exactly does system.out.print or system.out.printline or some such and what the receiver end is getting....and doing with it....
2014-02-26 05:00:58	JanC	*I* wasn't trying to figure it out  :)
2014-02-26 05:01:31	oleo	yes you enountered rather.....
2014-02-26 05:02:11	JanC	I only saw the link to that solution
2014-02-26 05:02:17	oleo	control flow is the hardest...sometimes the debuggers help but sometimes even not then...
2014-02-26 05:02:31	oleo	especially when multi threading is involed etc....
2014-02-26 05:02:48	oleo	it gets pretty unwieldy...even for the pro's i assume...
2014-02-26 05:03:29	oleo	especially when there are many parts in the implementation wrapping each other....
2014-02-26 05:04:48	JanC	in this case, the solution was easy to predict, presuming you have some knowledge about some particular terminal emulators
2014-02-26 05:06:25	JanC	so the environment influencing the main program in unexpected ways
2014-02-26 05:14:08	oleo	yes, often it's more complex....much to the detriment of the users or even the programmers.....

2014-03-13 08:06:50	Ankh	behdad, am i right in thinking i can't get at (enable/disable) opentype font features with pango  (e.g. old-style figures, small caps, historical ligatures)?

2014-03-13 08:28:31	behdad	Ankh: You can get to it through fontconfig config though.
2014-03-13 08:28:34	behdad	(with pango)
2014-03-13 08:29:16	Ankh	including smallcaps?
2014-03-13 08:29:29	Ankh	Id thought that was only script-related stuff

2014-03-14 21:23:42	RoelN_	I don't think I can help you, but the best way to try is to just ask ;)
2014-03-14 21:26:42	justinfront	Ok I want to work out how to make use of Kern data in TTF files, as far as I understand the library I am looking at processes the Kern data but does not currently output any information based on that data in relation to the glyhs selected.  I wanted to find some information that explains Kern data, I am not so interested in covering all cases just need enough info from a TTF file to give...
2014-03-14 21:26:43	justinfront	...acceptable layout of letters from most fonts likely to be used.
2014-03-14 21:29:51	justinfront	RoeIN_ if your interested I can point to the code parsing of the library I want to change, but I need to really understand a bit about how Kern generally works seems quite complex or maybe mostly it's simple.

Kern tables are used by applications to control the spacing between letters I wan to extract the information about Kern to use in Canvas.  Currently I believe the library I am using processes the Kern data from the TTF but only uses it for swf output, but I want to output some kern data I can use to layout letters myself.
2014-03-14 22:06:28	justinfront	Just reading some apple docs and they are not so clear really looking for some simplified docs on how it works.

2014-03-14 22:33:07	justinfront	oleo some of them don't really say much on kern that is of use.  Currently I think font kern is processed but getting a grip on how to use the data is not so clear https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/ocamllibs/blob/master/ttflib/tTFData.ml#L142  I know sometimes there are kern pairs but really I want to get a rough overview of what sort of kern is found in most fonts and how its normally structured.
2014-03-14 22:34:33	oleo	the last link tells that some features are extensions.....
2014-03-14 22:34:55	oleo	otherwise there seems to be different formats for layout stuff .....
2014-03-14 22:37:46	oleo	i think it goes like flat kerning table + additional layout formats if some extension is enabled on some platform or so.....
2014-03-14 22:39:40	oleo	and the stackexchange link mentions some stuff.....
2014-03-14 22:39:58	oleo	the enablers for those extensions or talks about the extension stuff itself....
2014-03-14 22:40:11	oleo	at least in the tutorial link provided in that link
2014-03-14 22:41:04	oleo	as far as i understood flat kerning tables may not be even consulted.....
2014-03-14 22:41:31	oleo	when there are other formats lying around....and when the extensions are enabled....
2014-03-14 22:41:44	oleo	correct me if i'm wrong....
2014-03-14 22:42:11	oleo	i'm in no way a pro reader....
2014-03-14 22:44:14	oleo	i think that's why OTF has been proposed or so....
2014-03-14 22:44:47	oleo	it standardizes outlining maybe....

2014-03-14 22:56:51	justinfront	oleo sorry firefox/chatzilla crashed.  Just looking at BirdFonts seems quite powerful opensoure app for fonts maybe I can get the info on kerning there.
2014-03-14 22:58:58	oleo	what did you get last of me ?
2014-03-14 22:59:26	justinfront	I got the links and then you talked generally and was about to reply.
2014-03-14 22:59:37	oleo	ah ok
2014-03-14 23:02:48	justinfront	http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/kern.htm  has pc kern
2014-03-14 23:05:02	oleo	allright that seems pretty close to what you look for ....i think
2014-03-14 23:07:22	oleo	and again it mentions the extensions for apple.....
2014-03-14 23:09:23	justinfront	Yer I don't find them highly readable I have the extension for apple that looks similar but twice as complex
2014-03-14 23:10:44	oleo	i think there's not a single standard there too.....
2014-03-14 23:11:18	oleo	heh
2014-03-14 23:11:26	oleo	fonts are crazy....lol

2014-03-14 23:16:04	justinfront	yep crazy but the ttf tool does quite a nice job of getting glyph data out for letters you need but to create your own kern is a pain I know I have had a go.
2014-03-14 23:19:17	justinfront	created my own letters based on two fonts for a-z in flash then got the vector data and then added some kern based on looks https://rawgithub.com/Justinfront/Letters/master/web/index.html  https://github.com/Justinfront/Letters/blob/master/src/letters/LetterResource.hx#L40
2014-03-14 23:20:08	justinfront	But really I need to use standard fonts and use there kerning.
2014-03-14 23:23:17	oleo	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning
2014-03-14 23:26:57	oleo	i ask myself if those extensions are in the class optical kerning....
2014-03-14 23:27:24	oleo	that would mean it doesn't even look up the kerning-table....
2014-03-14 23:27:32	oleo	it computes it....
2014-03-14 23:27:37	oleo	based on some algo...
2014-03-14 23:29:23	oleo	i think that page is really good and extensively gives intro into that subject....
2014-03-14 23:29:31	justinfront	also there seems to be gpos
2014-03-14 23:29:38	oleo	and ccf
2014-03-14 23:30:52	oleo	but anyway even if there is a given kerning in a given table and even if it is computed in some cases, it is still possible to override it (manual kerning)
2014-03-14 23:31:22	oleo	but still it's per font and per language even....
2014-03-14 23:31:40	oleo	ya, complex
2014-03-14 23:37:40	oleo	is ccf contextual kerning ?

2014-03-16 08:07:46	Ankh	with difficulty
2014-03-16 08:08:06	Ankh	you'd have to send the kern table to the app e.g. in json or xml, and parse it, i expect
2014-03-16 08:08:10	Ankh	and position each character
2014-03-16 08:08:15	Ankh	but I'm not certain
2014-03-16 08:09:13	Ankh	the rendering in canvas is *not* the same as HTMl rendering and is not CSS based
2014-03-16 08:09:22	Ankh	(although there are similarities in some parts)
2014-03-16 08:09:35	Ankh	it would be much better to use SVG instead of canvas.
2014-03-16 09:15:32	oleo	fewwww
2014-03-16 09:16:03	oleo	so complicated....

2014-03-20 22:06:04	felix__	Gentlemen, I have a problem with my Freetype+Infinality on Ubuntu 13.10. I want to make OSX2 theme darker, than it is by default. I tried to modify /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh, and it even writes its enviromnent variables, but it has no effect to font rendering at all.
2014-03-20 22:06:38	felix__	I reloaded several times, but it gave nothing.
2014-03-20 22:07:20	felix__	I tried to write the most insane values to infinality-settings.sh - but i cannot see any difference before and after.

2014-03-21 16:27:46	ankh	monodemono, hi
2014-03-21 16:28:16	ankh	the style is called "slab serif" or "egyptienne" usually
2014-03-21 16:29:48	monodemono	ankh: Thank you very much :)
2014-03-21 16:29:59	ankh	(that's not a font name but a class of fonts)
2014-03-21 16:30:25	monodemono	I figured that haha
2014-03-21 16:30:34	ankh	the logo font is probably Bodega Sans
2014-03-21 16:30:40	ankh	http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bodega-sans/
2014-03-21 16:31:25	monodemono	Yeah, not really interested in that part.
2014-03-21 16:31:47	monodemono	I basically want to make the little "flavored" white, and I'm good with photoshop, but not quite THAT good haha
2014-03-21 16:38:01	ankh	i'd guess "Flavored" is also bodega sans
2014-03-21 16:39:30	ankh	http://www.myfonts.com/search/bodega+sans/fonts/ and type Flavored into the Sample text box
2014-03-21 16:40:30	ankh	although the F doesn't look right so I'm not sure
2014-03-21 16:43:47	monodemono	Cool, thanks again for all the help :)

2014-03-25 05:52:48	myosotis	anybody know of some programs I get get font info on in linux? I make an eot font using fontforge or mkeot, the resulting font fails in IE, I use fontsquirrel to convert from same source ttf, and it works fine
2014-03-25 05:56:34	ankh	hi myosotis
2014-03-25 05:57:02	myosotis	hey
2014-03-25 05:57:30	ankh	there's a ttf2eot too
2014-03-25 05:58:27	ankh	check your server logs to see if IE is requesting the font
2014-03-25 06:00:14	myosotis	indeed it is
2014-03-25 06:00:32	myosotis	it renders correctly when served with the fontsquirrel font, but not the others, all produced from the same source material
2014-03-25 06:00:56	ankh	ok, and that the domain restriction in the header is right
2014-03-25 06:01:18	myosotis	is that an http header? or some part of the eot file
2014-03-25 06:01:24	ankh	part of the eot file
2014-03-25 06:01:40	myosotis	no clue, at least I have SOMETHING to look at now
2014-03-25 06:02:14	myosotis	in addition, the personally-generated fonts have Charset: 0 when I run eotinfo thefontfile.eot, but Charset: 1 with the fontsquirrel, I suspect that might have something to do with it
2014-03-25 06:02:22	myosotis	but I have lots of font-knowledge to gain
2014-03-25 06:02:49	ankh	yeah. but don't recent IE builds support woff?
2014-03-25 06:03:08	myosotis	sure do
2014-03-25 06:03:15	ankh	so you're going for ie6?
2014-03-25 06:03:19	myosotis	7+
2014-03-25 06:03:36	myosotis	7 and 8 only support eot afai can remember
2014-03-25 06:03:57	myosotis	I appreciate the discussion, but I have to get home, thanks ankh
2014-03-25 06:04:12	ankh	hmm, ok
2014-03-25 06:04:33	myosotis	I'm sure I'll be back here tomorrow if I still suck and you're still interested

2014-03-29 13:13:47	MihailJP	Hello I'm new to Open Font Library
2014-03-29 13:16:25	ankh	hello MihailJP
2014-03-29 13:16:33	ankh	welcome
2014-03-29 13:20:44	MihailJP	I'm going to submit my blackletter font. This is hosted at GitHub.
2014-03-29 13:21:09	MihailJP	Project page: https://github.com/MihailJP/TexturaLibera
2014-03-29 13:25:11	 *	ankh looks

2014-03-29 13:25:48	ankh	awesome. For my eyes as a Western calligrapher the space is a little wide
2014-03-29 13:26:11	ankh	I like that you have the tall s
2014-03-29 13:29:00	MihailJP	Thanks for your advice
2014-03-29 13:29:17	ankh	it is just a first impression looking at specimen.pdf
2014-03-29 13:29:27	ankh	did you base the font on a particular sample of handwriting?
2014-03-29 13:30:46	MihailJP	No, from my faint memory
2014-03-29 13:31:05	ankh	ah, ok
2014-03-29 13:31:32	ankh	your tall s is unusual in having a descender in the upright (italic faces usually do have it)
2014-03-29 13:31:40	ankh	but maybe it makes it easier for people to read, too
2014-03-29 13:32:04	ankh	many variants!
2014-03-29 13:36:51	MihailJP	I also think containing all 9 weight variants may be overkill...
2014-03-29 13:37:40	ankh	did you edit them by hand, or only run a script to make them?
2014-03-29 13:38:21	MihailJP	By FontForge Python script make-outline.py
2014-03-29 13:38:26	ankh	I see
2014-03-29 13:38:47	ankh	then there is less value than if they are hand-tweaked afterwards, usually, but I don't know in this case, have not looked
2014-03-29 13:39:23	 *	ankh tries rnning make, got "./make-outline.py line: 3 Undefined variable: from"
2014-03-29 13:39:46	ankh	maybe my fontforge is built without python
2014-03-29 13:40:01	ankh	no, seems unlikely
2014-03-29 13:42:05	ankh	Executable based on sources from 14:57 GMT 31-Jul-2012-NoPython. yes.
2014-03-29 13:44:30	 *	ankh rebuilds with python support
2014-03-29 13:44:34	ankh	(or I'm trying to)
2014-03-29 13:47:13	MihailJP	Package build for version 0.2.0 has just finished
2014-03-29 13:48:46	MihailJP	Both OTF and TTF packages are available; which one is preferred?
2014-03-29 13:54:09	MihailJP	okay, I'll upload TTF package
2014-03-29 13:57:32	MihailJP	Uploaded.
2014-03-29 13:58:38	MihailJP	yes, this number of variants is overkill...
2014-03-29 14:01:56	ankh	OTF probably
2014-03-29 14:01:58	ankh	oh
2014-03-29 14:02:13	ankh	well, I suppose they don't hurt, we'll see what others say :)
2014-03-29 14:02:47	MihailJP	okay
2014-03-29 14:15:06	MihailJP	oh... license tag is different from what I intended
2014-03-29 14:16:14	 *	ankh not an openfontlibrary person really, I can't fix that - the right people might well be at the libregraphicsmeeting.org conference that is just starting
2014-03-29 14:17:19	MihailJP	I intended license of M+ fonts, maybe font metadata is incomplete
2014-03-29 14:41:02	MihailJP	It seems that free-for-personal-use font is miscategorized as X11/MIT license
2014-03-29 14:41:22	MihailJP	namely http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/night-club-70s
2014-03-29 14:42:00	MihailJP	I think such a license is unsuitable for OFLB

2014-03-29 16:49:53	ankh	yes
2014-03-29 16:49:59	ankh	well, the system package lacked python
2014-03-29 16:50:17	ankh	yes, the narrower space is better :)
2014-03-29 16:50:23	diogenese	Ah, was wondering why it was left out.
2014-03-29 16:51:02	ankh	probably because it's compiled out by default
2014-03-29 16:51:15	ankh	you have to --enable it
2014-03-29 16:51:26	ankh	i should submit a new spec file
