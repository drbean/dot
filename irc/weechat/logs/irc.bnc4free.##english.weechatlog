2021-03-07 14:01:29	tinsoldier	[15:17:02] ice — Old English "is" "ice, piece of ice" (also the name of the Anglo-Saxon rune for "-i-"), from Proto-Germanic "*is-" "ice" (source also of Old Norse "iss", Old Frisian "is", Dutch "ijs", German "Eis"), of uncertain origin; possible relatives are Avestan "aexa-" "frost, ice," "isu-" "frosty, icy;" Afghan "asai" "frost." Slang meaning "diamonds" is attested from 1906. Modern spelling...

2021-03-07 14:01:29	OMGOMG_	[17:04:01] rey: "referring to"

2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:12] hi
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:19] Can we plan a call to discuss the role?
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[17:59:23] is that correct? ^
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[18:05:25] it's fine thojanssens1 
2021-03-07 14:01:29	thojanssens1	[18:06:14] thank you
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[18:44:17] if you have a tree of companies owning one another, what's the "top company" called?
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[18:44:20] like the parent of all of them
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:45:46] I guess maybe "root" is the appropriate term if we're speaking of a "tree" of companies? Otherwise, the generic term "parent company," which you mentioned, is fine too.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:46:47] good morning does this sound wrong "Accelerate your journey for having higher returning customers"
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:48:10] Accelerate your journey for having higher rate returning customers
2021-03-07 14:01:29	notthatgoodin	[18:49:01] Accelerate your journey to higher rate of returning customers
2021-03-07 14:01:29	darsie	[18:50:45] The root is typically at the bottom of a tree.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:51:04] Well, that's the physical location, but it "feeds" the rest of the tree, and is in a way in charge of all of it.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:51:21] Like the top company would be.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:53:46] nah, roots are usually at the top
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:01] most trees, except for the biological ones, grow down
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:54:27] I mean, I guess it depends on your frame of reference, but most people think the ground, and hence the earth or soil is the "bottom."
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:54:36] And the uppermost branches are the "top."
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:47] yeah, for those kinds of treesz
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:54:54] but for example binary trees grow down
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:55:16] ... "Binary" trees? I mean natural, living trees here. Not some discrete math construct.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	huf	[18:55:26] trees are trees :)
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[18:55:39] I guess you mean some graph theory thing.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[19:05:26] Biological trees are the only kind that matter >:)
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:04] raccoon_dog: if A owns B and B owns C, the parent of C would be B tho
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:11] so I think "parent" isn't clear enough
2021-03-07 14:01:29	erry	[19:06:16] I guess root is one term
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[19:06:20] Right, I see.
2021-03-07 14:01:29	raccoon_dog	[19:07:07] In more technical terms, the relationship isn't transitive. So parenthood indeed won't apply.

2021-03-07 14:01:29	tinsoldier	[20:20:19] hearable — Adjective: 1. That can be heard; audible https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hearable
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[20:21:20] why would anyone say "hearable" when they could just say "audible"
2021-03-07 14:01:29	ksft	[20:21:34] I would not
2021-03-07 14:01:29	bin_bash	[20:28:17] Neither would I and I would beg someone to never say "hearable" ever.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:34:24] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webscrapbook/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search : "Capture web pages to local device or backend server for future retrieval, organization, annotation, and edit." <-- What does mean "to capture" web pages? Does it mean to copy them locally or what?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:34:43] yeah, "store", probably
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:35:07] usually the browser just keeps them in memory
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:36:35] ksft, I doubt that it means to "store". I believe, the oriinal will be kept intact in this procedure.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:37:10] isn't that what storage is?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:37:36] no. storage means a transfer from one place to another.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:37:59] it does not
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:38:15] at least in common usage.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:38:33] are you a native speaker?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:38:46] no, I'm not.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:39:16] "store" doesn't mean any sort of transfer
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:39:30] you could put something into storage, and you might call that storing it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:40:08] and that's actually what I meant, but "store" can also mean 'keep in storage without moving'
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:40:34] bullgard4: in this case "to capture" means "to save a copy of"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:42:17] I agree with your message: "<ksft> "store" doesn't mean any sort of transer."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:42:37] MetaNova, thank you for commenting.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:43:33] ksft, The point is what will happen with the original object that is "stored".
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:44:05] ksft, The point is what will happen with the original object that is "captured".
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:44:09] as the plugin description indicates, the stored copies are for the purposes of future retrieval, organization, annotation, and editing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:10] well information is fundamentally different from physical objects
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:27] "storing" or "capturing" information doesn't do anything to the original
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:35] it involves copying it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	ksft	[20:44:52] storing or capturing a physical object would involve taking it
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:45:58] MetaNova, Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:48:25] MetaNova, I've got a supplemental question: Why did the author of this add-on use the word "to capture" and not "to copy"?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:49:59] it's a fairly common term in computing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:50:34] but 'copy' is even more common.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:50:45] to capture (particularly websites) means to make a standalone copy of something as it exists at that time - implying it has/will often change
2021-03-07 14:01:30	LuisM18	[20:50:50] pages being dynamic, current state of it being captured
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:51:18] Ah! Understood. - Thank you.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:51:33] and without context, "copy" can be confusing
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:51:59] if I were to say "I copied this website" it could easily be interpreted to mean that I mimicked it/outright stole it's format/layout/content for my own purposes
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:52:11] if I were to say "I captured this website" there is far less ambiguity
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:52:26] I see.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	MetaNova	[20:53:06] (admittedly it is also less ambiguous if I were to say, "I made a copy of this website")
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bullgard4	[20:54:05] ok

2021-03-07 14:01:30	Neo444	[21:02:43] why?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	bin_bash	[21:03:03] It's rude, unnecessary, and drama-inducing.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Neo444	[21:03:07] Do you know who I am?

2021-03-07 14:01:30	LuisM18	[21:03:35] does it matter?

2021-03-07 14:01:30	bin_bash	[21:03:50] nope that's why it was a funny response

2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:08:31] is "don't let's" an old way of saying "let's not"?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:15:31] tonta666: Old and/or dialectical.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:18:22] thanks, i was reading narnia so probably the first :P
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:22:23] I heard it in a mid 80s music video
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:24:16]  I am -0 on this atm.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:24:20] what does "-0" mean?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:25:05] I'm not sure it has any meaning outside of context
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:14] Hah, I remember discussing this here.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:19] I think hoglahoo was here for that.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:25:33] yeah, I brought it up because I had just heard it in that music video :)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:25:33] (Re: "don't let's.")
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:26:49] there's another phrase in it by the same speaker I don't understand.  I'm treating it like a puzzle though, so I don't want help yet
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:29:04] can you share it if we promise not to answer?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:29:45] channel's too big, some schmuck would ruin it!
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:30:14] at some point I'll bring it back up whether I gave up or figured it out
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:30:31] true
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Samian	[05:30:59]  Agree or disagree?   analysis == breaking a whole into its parts (forest to trees). Synthesis == combining parts to form a whole picture (trees to forest).   
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:31:20] amosbird: There are voting systems where people ofter a +1 (let's do this) or a -1 (I am against doing this)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:31:52] amosbird: A playful extension are +0 "We might as well" and -0 "Why bother"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	papna	[05:32:10] And then there's +1000000000000000000000000000000000
2021-03-07 14:01:30	Samian	[05:33:38] I don't think there's a word that means to do both analyze and synthesize. Doesn't the lay meaning of "analyze" encompasses synthesis too? while the more technical meaning of analyze does not?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	amosbird	[05:35:34] papna: thanks!
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:40:28] tonta666: eh I guess I give up.  I think he's saying "I don't want to be piss bored about with you" at around 0:10, but I'm not totally sure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0sr0ZnUc7I
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:41:20] the "don't let's" is there at the beginning, too, fwiw
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:45:39] hm, let me see
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:45:52] sounds like "pissballed" to me
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:46:18] "i don't wanna be pissballed of that with you"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:47:59] (not that i know what it means)
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:28] pissed on by that with you
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:52] or pissed bored of that
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:48:57] I think piss bored
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:50:26] piss bored is a thing actually said, I have never heard of pissballed heh
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:50:37] yeah, I've heard and read "piss bored"
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:50:48] not too sure about "bored about with..."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:50:52] But that's not my native dialect... so get an expert for the final word.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:52:09] not mine either but i hear an L rather than an R
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:52:30] I can see how it sounds like that, tonta666, but my ear doesn't really go that direction here
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:52:41] "I don't want to be piss bored of that with you" makes perfect sense in context 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:53:16] does it? doesn't "piss bored" just mean really bored?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:53:33] tonta666: Perhaps bored to anger in this sense ?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:53:42] he's tired of getting the runaround from her
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:07] I don't know.  This is turning into yanny/laurel 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:19] Dang compression artifacts :) 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:54:25] lol
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:54:32] or maybe it's "piss bald" because he's malding
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:54:51] oh
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:54:55] That thing is creepy. I remember when I could make myself hear "yanny" or "laurel" depending on I'd thought of.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:55:05] And it gave me the creeps in this really visceral way.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:55:18] s/on I'd/on what I'd
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tinsoldier	[05:55:18] r​accoon_dog meant: That thing is creepy. I remember when I could make myself hear "yanny" or "laurel" depending on what I'd thought of.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:55:31] Heh. I can do with with some optical illusions, and it can be unsettling. 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:57:13] piss-ball around 	Verb. To idle away time, to mess around. E.g."Isn't it about time you did some work, as you've been piss-balling around all morning."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:57:31] from http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/english-slang/p.htm
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:05] Hm, I prefer that interpretation then if we hav a cite for the term
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:58:08] okay
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:10] That has to be British slang or something because I've never heard that in my life.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:24] I couldn't find it, that's the meaning I guessed it would have if it existed, heh.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:25] I guess we could ask blk shp when he's active.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:58:28] sade is from scotland iirc?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tonta666	[05:58:32] or england?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:58:37] !w sade
2021-03-07 14:01:30	tinsoldier	[05:58:38] sade — Noun: 1. Alternative spelling of sadhe, — Verb: 1. (dialect) To tire, weary. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sade
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:58:41] It's absolutely British, exclusively.  Piss is rarely used like that at all in North American English. 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:58:51] I'm not sure it matters where she's from since she isn't the speaker
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:01] And he has a British accent :p 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:28] Oh, is "sade" a person here?
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:32] I should not say exclusively.  Sorry Australia.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:35] The lack of capitalization threw me off.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:38] Sade is the woman in the video, a musician.
2021-03-07 14:01:30	raccoon_dog	[05:59:45] ... Yeah, that's "Sade."
2021-03-07 14:01:30	hoglahoo	[05:59:46] man, if it's piss-balled I'm going to be upset with myself
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[05:59:55] I think it is
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[06:00:06] Hey, it's what I heard, and understood but was like "is that really a word?" 
2021-03-07 14:01:30	lucky	[06:00:16] And went on a wild goose chase :)

2021-03-07 14:04:47	hoglahoo	tomorrow?  don't let's waste any time, lucky
2021-03-07 14:05:20	tonta666	that would make the most sense but i'm torn between it and "...pissballed of that with you"

2021-03-07 14:08:37	lucky	raccoon_dog: It's a short skit before the video to set the context, and it's a spoken dialogue at a police station or similar 
2021-03-07 14:08:52	raccoon_dog	Oh, I see.
2021-03-07 14:09:09	raccoon_dog	I was scrolling up for the URL. I couldn't seem to find it.
2021-03-07 14:09:12	 *	raccoon_dog shrugs.
2021-03-07 14:09:15	hoglahoo	if you can find the script that works too

2021-03-07 14:09:41	raccoon_dog	Well, I mean, that's usually kept by the studio, unless they release it publicly; either that, or it's leaked.
2021-03-07 14:10:04	raccoon_dog	Also -- since this is a short skit, it may be improvised?
2021-03-07 14:10:06	lucky	A scene like that would have been shot probably with no script
2021-03-07 14:10:07	hoglahoo	what you just said doesn't really impact my desire to search for it on google one way or another
2021-03-07 14:10:09	lucky	it's 15 seconds
2021-03-07 14:10:18	raccoon_dog	Yeah, see. Improvised.
2021-03-07 14:10:19	hoglahoo	well, it continues on after the song
2021-03-07 14:10:26	lucky	Oh, never mind then.
2021-03-07 14:10:30	hoglahoo	not that particular scene, but I mean the story
2021-03-07 14:10:38	hoglahoo	and is interspersed during the song, too

2021-03-07 15:52:07	drbean-	I don't remember the name of the book in which Halliday (and a co-author?) make English out to be a topic-comment language, but the title of this article of his perhaps gives you an idea of his argument: ' It's a fixed word order language is English.'
2021-03-07 15:53:47	drbean-	That's not grammatical. More correct would be: ' It's a fixed word order language, English is.
2021-03-07 15:54:16	drbean-	drbean, why would that be more correct?

2021-03-07 16:01:37	huf_	surely all conversations are topic-comment structured to some extent
2021-03-07 16:01:50	huf_	but isnt the label usually reserved for languages where this has become part of the grammar?
2021-03-07 16:05:00	drbean-	Perhaps I was overstating Halliday's position. He may have just been showing the resources English has for structuring topics.
2021-03-07 16:05:14	huf_	or maybe I'm totally off about the whole thing
2021-03-07 16:06:33	huf_	somewhere on wiki .hu is described as a topic-prominent language IIRC
2021-03-07 16:06:38	huf_	and I dont really know what they mean by that ;D

2021-03-07 16:09:02	drbean-	I think I remember Hungarian in connection with Halliday's English grammar, but that's about all I know about Hungarian. It's not an Indo-European language?
2021-03-07 16:09:10	huf_	no
2021-03-07 16:09:27	huf_	it's uralic, the second most populous language family in europe
2021-03-07 16:09:49	huf_	after that, you just have the weirdness in the caucasus and basque
2021-03-07 16:09:57	huf_	oh wait, and a couple of others
2021-03-07 16:10:17	huf_	there's definitely some semitic in there
2021-03-07 16:10:47	drbean-	What are the languages in the uralic group?
2021-03-07 16:10:59	huf_	finnish, estonian, .hu, like a dozen small languages in russia
2021-03-07 16:11:13	huf_	saami?
2021-03-07 16:11:28	drbean-	Russian is not a uralic language? It's Indo-European?
2021-03-07 16:11:28	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:11:31	huf_	yes
2021-03-07 16:14:15	drbean-	In Japanese they have a special particle for topics and another one for subjects
2021-03-07 16:15:17	drbean-	So, I'm visiting a Japanese university and I go in and meet some profs with Dr Lee from Hong Kong University. Lee doesn't speak any Japanese. I do all the talking.
2021-03-07 16:15:56	drbean-	I introduce Lee. I say in Japanese, 'This is Dr Lee from Hong Kong University'.
2021-03-07 16:16:57	drbean-	OK. In a different scenario, Lee is not there when I meet the profs.
2021-03-07 16:17:37	drbean-	But I'm talking about Lee with the profs. Lee walks in. I say in Japanese. 'This is Dr Lee.'
2021-03-07 16:18:07	drbean-	The form of the 'this' in the 2 sentences is different.
2021-03-07 16:18:26	drbean-	Inscrutable, no?
2021-03-07 16:19:46	drbean-	In the first case, 'this' has the topic particle after it. Lee is the topic. In the second case, 'this' has the subject particle after it. Lee is not the topic.
2021-03-07 16:20:00	drbean-	Inscrutable, no?
2021-03-07 16:22:11	drbean-	Actually, Lee is not the topic. 'this' is the topic in the first case, because Lee is in the room, and everyone is aware of him being there, so 'this person' is a given.
2021-03-07 16:23:40	drbean-	In the second case, Lee walks in. It's a novel situation. 'this person' is new, not part of the topic.
2021-03-07 16:23:59	drbean-	That's the theory of the Japanese, anyway, apparently.
2021-03-07 16:24:37	drbean-	Don't you see some parallels between this situation and the use in English of the in/definite articles.
2021-03-07 16:26:17	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:26:29	huf_	the "rules" are batshit and you just have to learn to feel what's correct :)
2021-03-07 16:27:11	drbean-	'the' for things which are given, like 'wa' for topics in Japanese, with Lee's presence a given. And 'a' for new things, like 'ga' for new things, when Lee walks in.
2021-03-07 16:27:54	drbean-	lol. Can I quote that comment on my blog!

2021-03-07 16:32:23	huf_	people often ask about article usage here
2021-03-07 16:32:31	huf_	and we always end up with vague handwaving and basically
2021-03-07 16:32:43	huf_	in every specific case, we can immediately tell what article is correct
2021-03-07 16:32:51	huf_	but formulating any general rule? nah :D
2021-03-07 16:33:42	drbean-	I read in an American ESL textbook: A: I'm thinking of buying a wide-screen TV. B: I've seen those in the store.
2021-03-07 16:33:57	drbean-	"The store"?
2021-03-07 16:34:10	drbean-	There's only one store?
2021-03-07 16:34:14	huf_	yeah
2021-03-07 16:34:17	huf_	the one you saw it at
2021-03-07 16:34:33	huf_	:D
2021-03-07 16:35:29	drbean-	There are many stores. A doesn't know which store B is talking about. B is not talking about any particular store.
2021-03-07 16:35:45	drbean-	They mean they've seen them in stores.
2021-03-07 16:35:58	huf_	might not have seen them in multiple stores
2021-03-07 16:36:43	huf_	it's like "let's go down to the beach"
2021-03-07 16:37:54	drbean-	That's a new one on me. 'the beach'. But it doesn't mean any particular beach. It means 'a' beach.
2021-03-07 16:38:04	huf_	no, it means the beach where we're going
2021-03-07 16:38:17	huf_	the default one
2021-03-07 16:39:48	drbean-	What about 'the hospital' in AmE and 'hospital' in BrE. Do they mean different things in the US and UK?
2021-03-07 16:39:55	huf_	no
2021-03-07 16:40:06	huf_	what you have to realize is that to a large extent, all this is arbitrary
2021-03-07 16:40:33	huf_	why do you say "I saw the cat" but not "I saw the Gerald"?
2021-03-07 16:41:07	drbean-	Names and nouns are different things.
2021-03-07 16:41:12	huf_	apparently
2021-03-07 16:41:32	huf_	but not necessarily though. in Budapest Hungarian, you'd put the definite article before names too
2021-03-07 16:41:48	huf_	can be done either way
2021-03-07 16:41:52	huf_	English went with this scheme
2021-03-07 16:41:57	drbean-	Oh, interesting.

2021-03-07 16:45:41	drbean-	'The' in 'The Times' is part of the name, but it's not in the NY Times (The NY Times).
2021-03-07 16:46:59	drbean-	'I go to college/I'm studying at the university' in AmE, but 'I go to university' in the UK.
2021-03-07 16:53:38	drbean-	'school', not 'the school' in both.
