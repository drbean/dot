2020-09-05 11:42:18	drbean	From all the duckduckgo hits for 'I can confirm', it seems this is the way to use 'confirm' when it's you who's doing it.
2020-09-05 11:44:16	drbean	I guess it is the speech act of confirming (using 'can'), like 'Can you close the window' is the speech act of requesting (using 'can').
